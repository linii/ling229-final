I gave up trying to touch him or anything to make him excited. I just gave up. Usually when we did have sex I was always the one to initiate. Yesterday after his shower, he suddenly had the mood so I asked if he watched porn while showering. He got mad and pushed me away. I tried to turn things around but he said he's not interested, I told him that I'm just asking because I feel weird now when he suddenly wants to have sex. He now refuse to communicate with me, I don't know what I should do now.

781,2qh426,"I love my boyfriend of 4 years, but I am worried about our future lives together with his current and future levels of income. He is one of the smartest, most caring, and supportive people I have ever met but he is not wealthy. He has supported me through depression and an eating disorder and tutored me 2-3 nights a week to help me get on track with my classes when I was in college.

He makes about 55k as an assistant professor with a career max of around 100k. I make a little less working for the state government and I don't anticipate making much more anytime soon and may quit.

However, I will eventually inherit about $15 million of real estate and a stake in a business partnership from my family. I am very interested in continuing to build my family's wealth and I just don't see how my boyfriend can help me with that goal. I have been reading books about self-actualization and I have realized that money is my goal in life.

My boyfriend says he would support me in my decisions to pursue wealth building but that he is too busy with his career to help much with this goal. I told him that is fine but that in return he should make at least 400k a year in his career to contribute to our wealth building. He told me that wasn't realistic and actually called me selfish(!)

I don't know what to do. I feel so indebted to him for his love and help, but our goals for actualization are no longer aligned. I know that there are other men out there that either have the wealth or will help build the wealth that I desire. My current boyfriend makes less than ANY of my immediate or extended relatives.

842,2ntqwl,"I have a good friend Anne who I am currently roommates with. Anne and I get along well, we liked talking to each other and hanging out and all that. It's just that Anne has a bad habit that annoys the hell out of me.

Anne is always late. For example, if we makes plans to go to the park on Saturday at noon, we'll end up getting there at least 3 hours after our set time. If I ask her to meet me after class at a certain place, I'll have to wait there for half an hour until she comes. Just a few days ago, we made plans to go out for dinner. I waited in my room for hours (I messaged her but she wouldn't pick up her phone) until she came back, and it turned out she forgot our appointment and went out to eat with another friend. So many times I've arrived at our destination and gotten a text saying, I'll probably be there in another couple hours.

Maybe if this happened once or twice I wouldn't mind, but it's come to a point that if I make plans with her, I mentally calculate it so that she's hours late from our appointed time.

Since I live with her, I know the real reason she is always late is simply because she's lazy. I'll keep nagging at her to get ready to go do whatever, and she'll swear up and down that she'll be ready in five minutes, but she'll spend the next half hour sitting in bed and looking at her phone. She'll decide to eat a snack or take a long shower or take a nap or whatever instead of showing up at the original planned time. Just today, we made plans to go eat lunch and go shopping together, but since she decided to sleep in late, look at her phone for a couple hours, take a long shower, etc., so it was 4pm until she was ready to leave.

Frankly, it's driving me crazy and I'm beginning to really resent her. In fact, I get pissed off just thinking about it now. I even snapped at her a couple times. I feel guilty about it because Anne is such a good, generous friend otherwise and helped me out a lot in the beginning of the year. I've stopped going out with her as much because I'm tired of accommodating her, which I think she's noticed because it's been awkward and we've been growing distant.

I actually know that another one of her friends have basically dropped their friendship because she was annoyed at Anne for the same thing, but I don't want to do so. How do I get Anne to be more punctual? Should I even try? Any other advice?

173,1rrj0i,"This has been an ongoing problem with her.

To explain what I mean by interfering:
Last weekend she was over at my house and we went to the mall. We ran into one of my good friends (19M) that had just been discharged from the Navy (he'd literally gotten back the day before) because of a vision problem and we'd been having a physical relationship before he joined the Navy. We all went back to my house to catch up. (It was me, my 17F friend, her 17M bf, my 19M friend, and his 19F cousin)

My 19M friend was pretty clearly still interested in me as he would follow me when I would go downstairs for long periods of time and he'd be on the verge of kissing me, but then my 17F friend would run downstairs and just stand there while we tried to pick out a movie  until eventually we went upstairs because 17F's bf and 19M's cousin had been left alone and I don't know either of them particularly well.

That same night my parents got home late and the only ones that were at my house were me, 17F (who was spending the night), and 19M (who my parents always expected to stay at the house late, my whole family likes him). Well 19M had left his car at the mall so I was going to take him back so he could go home, but it was past 9, I only have my less restricted liscense, and my parents are law abiding citizens, so my mom said that she would take us to drop him off. 

I sat in back behind the drivers seat, 17F went around to the front, and 19M went around to sit in back with me. Then suddenly 17F decides to be generous and offers the front seat to 19M and he says he'll sit in back, but she insisted so he gave her the option of where she wanted to sit. She sat in the back seat. It was an obvious blunder to everyone but 17F, so my mom pointed it out to her once 19M left and she felt very dumb.

That night has caused a rippling effect. Since then he has not texted me back except to tell me he's working (I asked if he wanted to hang out at 6 and he said he couldn't because he worked at 10) and the only other time I've hung out with him was when my brother invited me to play Magic with them without telling him and he barely aknowledged my existence.

17F is probably one of my best friends, but she notorious about turning guys off to the idea of certain girls unintentionally. I can tell that its mostly because she wants to feel included (If someone is telling a story she'll jump in with I remember that!'s even though she wasn't there. Or I was explaining to someone that my AJROTC ACUs aren't as uncomfortable as they look and she chimed in with 
they're really not, trust me I've worn hers when I've never let her touch my ACUs), but a lot of times it just comes off as needy, whiny, and annoying.

Like I said, she's one of my best friends, but she's extremely dependent and sensitive. I would have already brought all of this up to her, but she doesn't take criticism or correction well. Like at all. She starts crying as soon as you tell her something is wrong. Then she doesn't talk to me because she thinks I'm mad and need my space even though I've explained that I'm not mad and I just want her to understand where I'm coming from. She's just very hard to handle sometimes and I don't know how I can help her be more independent or explain to her that her neediness is interfering with my relationships with other people.

165,1rymxk,"I've been very close friends with a girl friend of mine for over 8 years now. We've been through a lot together, and we're able to pretty much share everything with each other. We never dated, and I really don't really intend to get close romantically with her. She has had a lot of bad relationships in her past, and I really don't want her to feel like the one guy she can come to no matter what was still just in it to bone her. Additionally, we met before I was ever really interested in dating girls, and talking to her about the first girl I had a crush on was really what kind of solidified us. She had been dating my best friend of 5 years at the time, so she was a good option to get womanly advice from. I did end up getting to dating that girl and a few others thanks to her help, but I never really saw her as someone of romantic interest because I knew her before I even wanted to hold hands with a girl. I never felt friendzone type resentment, I even had to clear it up with her mom (who I also got along with well) when she said too bad she friendzoned you (probably because her mom couldn't stand to see her poor girl's heart broken so much from bad relationships and she trusted me more) I did have to clear that one up.

She has been in and out of a lot of relationships, some worse than others, but she really pours a lot of her heart into them, so they all seemed to be rough. For example, with my best bud, it was hard, but it was just tears and crying. She mostly was with men, then she kind of jumped into a marriage prompted on by the military (basically, if they didn't marry, they'd have to break it off. This was one of her better relationships and she had been with him for about 2 years, so it was kind of rushed, but a mistake in the end). It took a lot out of her, and eventually it didn't work out. 

After a while, she turned back to dating, but she had suddenly turned to women. Not a big deal to me, and not really my call or much of my business anyways. However, the woman she started seeing was probably among the worst choices possible, and in my own opinion, the worst choice she has ever made (even considering her divorce). 

It started out pretty simple. I didn't know the girl, but she looked... *rough*. Soon, my friend is deleting her facebook to move to a conjoined one. More red flags are popping up when I'm finding it hard to get in contact with her, and that she's calling my parent's old home phone (a number I knew she remembered, as opposed to my cell that was saved) to get in touch. She's getting in touch with me on Steam, which she never ever used before. She's thinking of marrying this girl only 4 months in, she's asking me if I want to be the sperm donor to their child. I'm trying to keep her from moving too fast, but our talks are getting shorter and shorter.

Then we're losing contact and I'm legitimately worried. Her mom is contacting me, asking if I've heard from her. I finally get a call from a mental institution, and it's her on the other line. She's a little vague, but she mentions her girlfriend being manipulative and keeping her away from me and that she's sorry. Not much info. She drifts in and out from this place, trying to take her girlfriend with her to maybe straighten it out. Doesn't work. They finally break it up and she's staying in the institution for a while to clear things up. 

Anyways, this is all building up to me getting a call a week or so later, and she's out, at her dad's, and asking me if I'd like to visit. Hell yes I'm driving out several hours for a weekend with her. I've been worried sick, so even though it's the dead of night, I pack a bag and head out. 

We get to talking like old times. She's on a lot of medicines. Well, that's fair, if she went through enough trauma to go to a mental health facility, I would be more surprised if she didn't have any. Drugs were involved. Fuck, I knew that bitch was no good. She wasn't eating or sleeping at all because her girl was strung out on meth and she didn't feel right eating or sleeping without her. Goddamn, this is terrible. She quit her job, blew through her money and started dealing in hard drugs with the girl to get by. I'm completely lost for words. I didn't want to get upset, I know she hid all of this up until now because we did at least have a shred of contact throughout this. I'm also relieved to hear her saying she knew how bad her ex was, and that she is being completely honest with me. She is saying it all so calmly and matter-of-factly, and I feel that a lot of it was sorted out earlier while she was in the institution. I'm just glad to have her safe.

I really hope I haven't sidetracked from what is legitimately concerning me too far, I suppose this is all setting the stage. At this point, I mean, I'd do *anything* for her to make her feel better. Anyways, I had arrived very late, and she takes some medicines which make her drowsy. We plan to sleep on two separate couches in the living room, but we watch a movie and chit-chat a little bit in it, we've both seen it. She starts drifting off and lays her head in my lap a little. Now, this isn't exactly odd. We have slept together, as in literally sharing the same sleeping space, nothing sexual, so it's not terribly awkward, but for the first time for me, it kind of made my heart race a little. We had shared this space a bit before I was really sexually into girls at all, so it didn't cause this kind of response. And with heart-racing stimulation in my chest, it also manifests itself a little in my pants. However, there was an ad for a sex show on at the literal moment I was getting excited, so she laughs at me a bit for it and rests on my shoulder instead. She drifts off talking about sleeping with her ex for rebound sex at the end of all of this mess and it might have been a mistake because he's having flashback feelings... Whatever. It's not the worst thing you've done in all of this. She drifts away on me and I finish the last bit of the movie before moving to my own couch to sleep. 

Next day approaches. We spend time going to a nice heated pool and hot tub with some of her family, eat fancy foods, do the stuff that she invited me for. Overall, it went well, but even her dad is telling me If she asks you what to do, you need to be more direct. As indecisive as women are, they hate it, kinda felt like he was giving me some relationship pointers to something that didn't exist. 

Anyways, we're driving back. We're sitting in the backseat and she starts laying down to sleep, but she lays her head on my leg, and I kind of move my corresponding arm away from her in an awkward, uncomfortable position. Her dad and dad's girlfriend get out of the front of the car to pick something up and she grabs my arm and drapes it over her neck and moves my hand to wrap up and around her head. This gets my heart racing again, and I don't want to make it look like I'm making a move on her in front of her dad, so I kinda pull back blushing and saying it's a bit awkward. She scrunches inward so she's not laying her head on me anymore.

We get back for the night, things calm down, it's getting late, we're in that couch from the night before and I found it reclines, so I'm getting relaxed in my blanket as we put on another movie. I finally get it out that it was awkward because I was getting a little turned on from it. I blush a little and she feels a little flattered by it. She eventually goes back to resting on my shoulder, saying she felt really safe with me and she slept easier than ever last night and thanked me for coming. She starts sliding down a little lower. She gets back to my legs and picks at them a sec and says Ugh, hairy legs. This is why I'm a lesbian Ok, wat? You just slept with a man, but... ugh, I'm not gonna complain about it. During all of this she said Don't think of me as a girl, think of me as [name]. Don't be such a robot. I try to ask what the robot comment means, but she just says It's too late, I'll say later... She wants to cuddle a bit, I go ahead and do it, it honestly just felt nice to put my arms on her. Eventually we're repositioning and pretty much spooning. I kinda back my extremely inflated pants backwards so she can't feel it, but eventually her elbow passes by, and she gives me a few light jabs giggling at me. I sort of apologize and ask if it's okay, and she's fine with it, I press it on her. I know at this point I'm doing bad things. I just can't help it. It felt nice. Yeah, I'm terrible at being just friends, I know. I've got my arms around her, and while she used to grab me by the arm, now it's by the hands. She holds my hands in place... I move my fingers open and now we're holding them. We snuggle a bit more, and finally my wrist gets locked under her arm, she's dangling my hand right above her chest, and my hand doesn't have much room to move around. I finally relax a bit, and my hand drifts right down onto her breast. Dammit, it was right there... and I just held it and felt it, because I couldn't resist (I do know this was terrible of me). I moved it around a little, and I really would be lying if I said it wasn't nice.. She kinda drifted away or pretended to soon after, so I just didn't talk about it. 

Next morning, it was pretty normal. We had some breakfast like the day before, she got a shower, I packed up and rolled out. Never asked about that robot comment. It's bugging me now. 

Honestly, I know I probably messed up a lot throughout this. I just don't know what to do with her or myself. I'm sure we'll just never mention it like the first time I got drunk with her and she kind of nibbled at my ears, but she was seeing someone else at the time, so I didn't push it. That happened like 3 years ago, anyways.

I don't want to ruin my friendship over a little bit of fun in a relationship, but maybe I had stronger feelings than I thought, I just never realized them because I never felt sexually attracted to her, but I definitely feel like I have that now. I never considered her as someone to date, but I can't shake what happened. 

Even if you kind souls can't offer any guidance, I'm just happy to have this off of my chest. Normally I'm fine with dating now, but this kind of brought me back to my more awkward self, closer to when I first met her and needed guidance. I know this was really long, and I applaud you if you read it all. Thank you.

85,1y6qko,"Just a little background on my life and why I'm constantly frustrated with everything.  I never liked my home life.   Everything was frustrating.   There was a really big fear in me about disobeying my parents through most of my life.  As a kid, when I would play outside with school friends, my mom would tell me not to play with those kids.   They had a fear that I would grow up to be a horrible person.   So I played video games a lot instead.   She then told me to play outside.   Again I was limited by not being able to play with friends.   Because of this grade school was shitty.   I was barely able to have friends out of fear of my parents. 

After high school, what I wanted to go to school for wasn't important to my parents.   They just wanted an engineer or a doctor.   I was heavily depressed at this time.   Thoughts of suicide were an everyday thing.   I was working while going to school and didn't have any friends.   I met my best friend around this time.   We didn't become friends until the following year when he got a job at the same place as me.  I think being able to have that one friend saved me.  Because of him, I pulled myself out of depression. 

To the point because this is getting longer than it should.   So in December I told my mom I'm moving out in June.  Coincidentally, my best friend is buying a house and he wanted a room mate.   Since then she's been trying to find any reason to keep me home.   I'm only moving 30 minutes from home.   It's not far.  If they need anything I can help.   (Also, I have a Pakistani background.) 

I feel like this house I live in is a prison.   I don't think I can live my life my way if I stay.   My mom is trying to coerce me into marriage because I'm moving out.   I feel like my life will be over before I have a chance to experience anything.  I want to get away so I can have some peace.   I'm a introvert and my mom refuses to understand I need time to myself if I'm going to keep sane.  

My mom is making excuses like we never bother you, we didn't tell you not to make friends and stuff like I should be married if I'm moving out.  What will the people think?  I have to get away if I'm going to stay sane.  Because my younger brother moves back and I can't stand his shitty attitude and he starts cursing and threatening every time he disagrees.   I stay quiet and endure everything because of my mom.   I can't stay in a place like this.   She won't understand.   I explained it in so many ways.   We just had another argument about it.  

I told her I'm moving out in June whether anyone likes it or not.   I could care less about Pakistani status and class nonsense.   It's limiting any progression.   I make more than enough to pay for rent, food and school.  What do I do from here?

1023,2ya3n3,"So about 3 months ago, I met this girl online that lives about 3 hours away from me. I decided to go see her (I also have friends in that town so it was win-win), and we hit things off. We've been on a couple of dates, we talk everyday, I had met her mom last time I was there, so on so forth. We aren't exclusive btw.


My dilemma is I'm thinking of ending things with her. I'm really falling for this girl, hard, but I just don't think things will work out. I've been contemplating a move to her city even before I met her, but with the way things are going with my job and just the stuff going on in my life, I can't see myself committing to someone else when my shit isn't straight in my own personal life. Long distance relationships are tough. This is also a VERY beautiful woman so I know eventually she's gonna end up meeting someone else closer to her that will be able to meet all of her needs. I don't know what to do with this one. Any help is appreciated. I apologize if some of this stuff doesn't make sense, I have a million thoughts racing through my mind right now.

14,1h7nnx,"I have known my housemate, James, for more than two years. We're both students at the same university. For the upcoming school year, we decided to live together in a 4 bedroom house off-campus, along with my best friend, Megan, and a friend of James' that I have yet to meet. He's always been a little... off, but he's a good friend, and he's a totally fine roommate. Megan and I lived in the same dorm as him a year ago, and we've all spent a lot of time together. It's really hard to explain some of his behavior, but I'm going to try.

Megan and I live on the bottom floor of the house, in two separate bedrooms. My boyfriend is living here with us for the summer to help out with rent, and our fourth roommate is not moving in until August. James lives upstairs. Megan, my boyfriend, and I all like to spend time together, get a little wasted, hang out--and James does too, but very selectively. Occasionally he will come down and drink with us/eat with us, but generally only when he is literally forced by me or by Megan.

* He has a complete inability to make reasonable decisions for himself. For example, he constantly puts himself in situations to fuck up every interpersonal relationship he has, mostly by two-timing girls. It's really sad, because he's not a player at all.
* He lambasts himself for doing this to girls, but he keeps doing it anyway. He constantly criticizes and hates himself for his actions, but refuses to do anything to stop fucking his life up. Self-punishment is something that I see happening a lot. I think he fucks his life up in certain ways as a way to punish himself for his feelings of being a bad or inadequate person.
* He has a hard time taking care of money, in that he does not understand how to make a budget or how to be responsible. He currently is working at an unpaid internship, and his parents pay for his gas, food, utilities, and rent. He gets plenty of money from them, but he cannot keep track and he often has to ask his parents for more money because he spends on things like alcohol that he doesn't drink and expensive gourmet food from Trader Joe's that he doesn't eat, instead of going to cheaper grocery stores.
* He has issues with his hygiene sometimes and has bad skin. He once told me that he does not use shaving cream, which causes ingrown hairs and a lot of red marks on his face. I asked him once why he didn't just use shaving cream, since it would help his skin a lot, and he told me that he likes the pain. I think it's another form of self-punishment.
* He gets very locked into certain ways of thinking. Once he decides something, regardless of whether it is true or not, he is completely stuck in that way of thinking.
* He gets very stressed by school work and extracurriculars, but occasionally he will become extremely obsessed with aspects of his work. He is a generally obsessive person. He can't let anything go. For example, there are multiple girls who he used to like in high school, who he will not let go of and we still hear about it.

Megan and I have always known that James has some issues, but we love him anyway. He's a really sweet person, when he's not holed up in his room hating himself. T

What brought everything to a point, though, was this past weekend. James was out of town, and Megan, my boyfriend, and I were hanging out up in his room blowing up balloons to fill his closet with (we all play a lot of pranks on each other). We were hanging out in his room, checking out the books on the bookshelf, when we saw one that was turned the wrong way. Megan pulled it out to see what book it was (not unusual for our friendship at all, James, Megan, and I spend a lot of time in each other's rooms, checking out books and hanging out). 

We'd accidentally stumbled on a diary of sorts, that had a LOT of disturbing things in it. If the first entry hadn't been so disturbing, we would have put it back right away when we realized what it was. The first entry was extremely odd. It was written in three different colors of ink. In the first part, in black ink, he introduced himself as James and listed true things about himself. In the second part, in blue ink, he called himself by a different, nonsensical name and included many details including that I am a God, I do not pity, I feel no emotion, etc. It's a packed book, including odd lists, and strange stories. He references a Voice and frequently mentions that he is a God. He also includes some entries talking about school work and basically criticizing himself for not being productive. For example, many were along the lines of, Got nothing done today. What the fuck is wrong with me. BAD, BAD JAMES. He also frequently mentioned his depression and his hatred of life and his worthlessness.

Megan and I care about James a lot, but we're now seriously concerned and unsure of how to start a conversation about this issue. We obviously can't straight up ask/accuse him of being mentally ill. I don't know that I can just sit still and ignore it anymore though, because it's becoming increasingly apparent that something is wrong. I

378,34ujez,"Sorry I'm not a great writer, if there are any errors please let me know. So my roommate and I have been living together for five years come August. We were friends before we were roommates, and although we've had some rough patches I'm a pretty laid back person so we've managed to work our differences out and generally get along well. I've had a few red flags about her poor decision making skills and lack of judgement in the past, but this takes the cake. 


I left for a week long vacation 7 days ago. Before I left I asked her to watch my cat, who is very low maintenance. I asked that she dump some dry food in his bowl, and fill up his water once a day. No litter necessary, I left out extra pans. I hate asking her to change cat litter because it's gross and she's doing me a favor. 


I didn't have any contact with her when I was gone because I was pretty busy, and like I said, my cat is pretty low maintenance. Last night she sent me a message asking when I would be home. I replied I'd be back tomorrow afternoon. Lucky for me, I caught an early flight in. I got home early, exhausted and ready to sleep and shower. When I opened my door there was someone sleeping in my bed. This person is basically a stranger to me, I was introduced to her by name once at my roommates place of work. When she saw me she got up, said 'oh' like she was surprised to see me, grabbed her duffel bag full of clothes off the end of my bed, and left. My shower has also clearly been used. I'd also like to state that I am a very introverted person, and my personal space is a sanctuary of sorts to me. 


I'm upset because this person is basically a stranger to me. I have personal documents on and in my desk, including my checkbook that was sitting on my desk from just paying rent before I left. I'm not saying my roommate hangs out with criminals, but I literally don't know anything about her coworker. I feel violated by my roommate and I also feel like this was intentionally deceitful. I don't think I'm unjustified in feeling this way, my question is: how do I go about confronting my roommate? What should I say and how should I say it? I'm worried she's going to justify what she did by saying that she did me a favor by feeding my cat, but honestly I could have had someone else do it, I just asked her because she lives there and it takes a few minutes. I'm also supposed to live with her next year, so I'm contemplating finding new roommates. My lease is up in September. 

TL;DR; Roommate let a coworker who I don't know sleep in my room while I was away on vacation without asking me. I feel violated and don't really want to live with her anymore. 

[update] So after I posted this I went into the kitchen and realized roommate and coworker killed an entire handle of liquor that was mine plus a 6 pack I had in the fridge. That set me off again, so I texted her saying that we need to talk. She texted me back saying 'okay.' I've been home all day cleaning my room with the TV on, and she must have come in grabbed her dog and left because her dog was gone when I walked into our living room. I thought this was pretty disrespectful, and I could tell she was trying to avoid me. 

When she came back an hour later I was waiting and I caught her in the kitchen before she could head to her room. Honestly she looked like she'd been caught red handed. She'd run out with her dog and bought me two bottles of liquor and replaced my beer, then proceeded to apologize. Although this was a nice gesture, it's still 'begging for forgiveness' instead of 'asking for permission.' I told her that she was deceitful and disrespectful. I got a little angry through this, but she didn't try to argue or anything. Just looked like a sad puppy. I think she's getting too comfortable with be because we've lived together too long, and I don't like being taken advantage of. And honestly, because she knew it was wrong made it worse. She was being intentionally deceitful. 

So, what I'm going to do:

-Draw up a list of roommate boundaries. I never thought this would be needed but apparently common sense has left our home.

-Move my liquor into my room. This is like the 4th time this has happened, and whenever she replaces a bottle she drank she then feels entitled to drink out of the new one as well because she bought it. Nope. 

-I'm traveling a lot this summer, I'll be gone about a little over a month in all. For my trips, I'm going to move my cat to my father's house and keep my door locked. I do have a deadbolt on my door. 

Thanks for letting me vent guys.

248,1h3bd2,"Hey everyone, thanks for clicking this.

I'm kind of going crazy.
I've had this friend, let's call her Ruth. Ruth and I have been friends for a long time now, nearly a decade, and we never had any problems getting along. In fact, she was one of the people who I never had any issues with. Maid of honor material.
This past year, something changed. Ruth has been overweight for most of her life, and she recently lost a bunch of weight. Since then, I've noticed a marked change in her personality. She's more confident, physically and emotionally, which is a good thing. But she's also become ... well ... a bit competitive.


Now, she's always been the kind of girl that takes a ton of selfies and talks about her life a lot. But lately, her behavior has turned aggressive.
More than just dominating the conversation, it seems like she's taking passive-aggressive shots at me, and its affecting the way people in our immediate circle interact with me.


Example 1: I confided to her that my ex had some ... well ... less than PC photos of me that his malicious gf had gotten her hands on and blackmailed him into dropping contact with me. I expressed my distress to her for having been deceived, and told her I worried that one day my pictures would become public.
Result: Since then, our other friend, Heather (name changed) has been taking unflattering photos of me at parties, drinking and smoking. She doesn't do this to anyone else. I've asked more than once for her to delete the pictures, and she flat out refuses. She says If I ask her again, she'll post them on facebook. Additionally, Ruth once humblebragged about a guy she was sleeping with saving a photo of her that she posted on facebook. She said, and I quote, It's not blackmail material at all so I don't know why he'd save it ...


Example 2: One time at New Years, I was ill from drinking too much. Without asking, they smoked over half my ganj.
Result: Heather has been known to gimp me on ganja or take my hair products and not return them until months later. Additionally, they both ask me to constantly fetch them stuff that's within walking distance of them.


Example 3: She repeats things I say to her in private ... She knows I'm not very open about my feelings and don't really like people to know the little details of my life. I.E. My aspirations about becoming a screenwriter. She announces that she's going to be a screenwriter in front of everyone, as if that had been her intention all along. She's done this NUMEROUS times. Months later, at another party, she repeatedly refers to someone as looking like a screenwriter because they look like shit. I've never made fun of her decision to go into advertising.
Result: She feels the need to dominate and cut me out of conversation. I don't understand why, because I don't feel like a threat to her. Whenever a guy hits on me or even talks to me, she immediately appears and inserts herself into the conversation. She once berated me so much in front of a dude that he actually ended things with me shortly after. (or, atleast, I think her attitude contributed)


She's even made jokes about dropping me as a friend.


What's the deal, reddit? Am I just being paranoid? This girl has some many friends and so many people like her, why am I the object of her ire? Did I screw myself by divulging a secret to her?

456,2spqij,"Ok, so this might be long so I apologize in advance. Throw-away account. My boyfriend and I are long-term relationship and we live together. His anger issues started to show when we moved in together and not around his parents. One of the incidents happened today. Today I was running errands and went to my college to prepare for classes. I asked my boyfriend what this slang term meant because someone said it to me at the college today (happened to be a male), the reason I asked my boyfriend is because he usually listens to hip-hop and I sometimes ask him what the words mean. My boyfriend immediately gets upset and says he is going to go to the school tomorrow and get that guy fired. I told him I don't think that is necessary. 

A couple hours pass and I help him with his homework and I decide to go to bed. As I'm walking away he gets angry and says I bet you were smiling at the guy, you fucking whore. - I said, No, I wasn't At least not in a flirty way. I close the door and go to bed, but then wake up to him playing really loud hip-hop music. I get up and open the door and ask him to please turn it down, I am trying to-- and he cuts me off Can you shut the fuck up, you fuck--- so I close the door because there is no point to hang around and listen to him. 

He gets at these points of anger where I either try to 1. Calmly talk to him 2. I start to argue back or 3. I ignore him. Either one of these I do he will always stay angry and keep insulting me with really harsh words. So tonight I tried to ignore him. He comes into the room and says again I was probably smiling at him and calls me a whore, then threatens to go there tomorrow to get him fired. I don't say anything this whole time and he leaves. That whole time he kept pulling the blanket off me and pulling the pillow from under me. 

I started crying silently because it upsets me. I told him before he has an anger problem and he should do anger management. His parents even told him he has an anger problem. We are both from different cultures, but I have never seen his parents act this way. I am really getting stressed out and I told him he stresses me out and I have bad anxiety and this makes it worse. I don't know how to handle it anymore. Watch what I say? We have plans to get married and have kids, but I told him I don't want kids for a very long time. I told him I don't want kids until he stops talking to me like that because I don't the kids to hear him calling their mom a whore. 

There is more to this, so I guess I will add this. Before we got into a relationship we knew each other and liked each other, but were not in a confirmed relationship (we didn't even kiss). I slept with another guy ( I regret this) and my boyfriend thinks that I cheated on him, but I never have and I explained to him that we were not in a relationship during that time. So he usually brings up this incident from years ago to call me a whore.

A few days ago, one of the online friends, Abe, suddenly cut off contact with the other, Ben. They've known each other for like 10 years, and went to high school together, but now live on opposite sides of the country. Abe didn't tell Ben why he cut him off, he just removed him from friends and is not responding to any texts/calls. Abe did tell us, but asked us not to tell Ben. Abe said he felt forced to do things with Ben and that Ben was always belligerent, calling people names, (ribbing as Ben would call it) etc., so he couldn't really relax when doing things with him. So Abe decided he was better off without him and went no contact.

I talked with both of them and they seemed to understand that I was still friends with both of them and they seemed okay with that.

He did it before I could even explain that it wasn't a problem or ask why it upset him so much.

Ben really really did not like not knowing what he did wrong to Abe. He seems to feel deeply betrayed and wronged by Abe. My thinking is that, he feels Abe is doing an injustice to Ben, and our still playing things with Abe is tacit endorsement of that injustice.

I have no idea if there's anything me or my girlfriend can do in this situation to help or get Ben back as a friend. We never wanted to lose either of them. We enjoyed both of their company.

570,1mfl5o,"I've had a rough weekend and I've been doing some introspecting.


So here's my story: I've been burned by some bad experiences w/ women in the past year. I was dating a girl I met through work way back in February -- that lasted about two months before she dumped me (her ex-boyfriend came back into her life).


I then started to spend a lot of time with another colleague at work, but when I finally asked her out on a date-date she told me (five minutes into dinner) she just wasn't interested in me in that way anymore (this was about a month ago)...


Most recently, I went out on a few dates with a friend of my roommate's, only for me to recognize some red flags (cancelling a date twice in succession is a big turn-off).


All of this I'd be fine with -- life and all that -- but here's the thing: I haven't been a real, lasting relationship since I was twenty, I haven't had intercourse in two years (one of about five times I've actually had sex), and I haven't had ANY kind of sexual encounter in over a year.



I was very nervous about the sexual aspect w/ the girl from last winter, and it never progressed beyond heavy petting (I suspect this was part of the reason she broke up with me, especially because I've heard from here about her currently ample sex life -- we're kinda sorta friends, but I really don't want to spend much time thinking about her/talking to her anymore, but we do work at the same place, which makes me feel like an even bigger loser...)


I genuinely cared for this woman, along with my other friend who rejected me at dinner (I still actually care for this one, too) -- my roommate's friend, on the other hand, I had serious reservations about (she called homeless people welfare rats, for one thing), but frankly I was willing to overlook that so long as there was the potential for sex. I spent the night at her apartment last week, and while nothing happened aside from cuddling and heavy petting, I was okay with that at the moment, especially since she's Catholic and you never know with Catholics just how pious they are.


But the thing is, I want sex. I want to get good at sex. I want to be a skilled, experienced lover who can really satisfy women. But I'm almost totally inexperienced. I didn't date in high school, nor in college. My first (and to date only) girlfriend was a woman I met during a study abroad program. It didn't work out for two reasons -- one, we lived on opposite sides of the country, and two, we found it very difficult to actually have sex on account of my size. (I'm not porn star-sized, but I'm definitely on the big side. It's actually kind of ironic -- I didn't realize this at all until about four months ago, when I was reading some of the threads here.) It really killed my confidence, and the string of bad dates and lack of friends while I was living in my hometown didn't help things.


When I moved to a new city about a year ago, things got better. I have a lot of different friends, get on well with my roommates, have a pretty decent job, applying to grad schools in a few months. I mean, really, objectively speaking my life isn't so bad right now.


But I want sex, and I also feel like a HUGE loser for being celibate. My ex is currently hooking up with some kinky dude, all of my roommates have *very* active sex lives, and I just end up feeling like shit about myself, and slowly spirally down the drainpipe of depression. 


I'm going to therapy and that's helped somewhat. My therapist has told me I need to revamp the narrative in my head of failed relationships and frustrated sexuality and focus on the positives and all the pluses I bring to the table. It's good advice -- thanks to therapy, I'm no longer insecure about dealing with these issues at 24 -- and I'm trying my best, but it's very, VERY hard without some tangible success to back it up. Otherwise, I'd just be living in denial.


I even made a list of my positive and negative attributes -- the positives from what my friends (and even my ex) told me, the negatives from my own inventory.

I guess I just don't know. I mean, I know what I want -- a healthy, active sex life, eventually finding and committing to a great woman who I like and who likes me. And the first step is to start up a casual, mainly sexual relationship so I can learn things and build up some self-confidence. If it goes somewhere else, great; if it doesn't, that's fine, too -- at least I've gotten something out of it.


But I can't even seem to make that happen, and it just depresses the hell out of me. What should I do?

Last week, we met up in Staunton for a party at her friend's house. At the party, she got tipsy and started flirting on this one guy she works with and completely ignored me throughout the whole night. She had often mentioned him on the phone but I thought nothing of it. I must say I was slightly concerned but I had no reason to think it meant anything.

When we came back home, I wasn't too happy and told her I really didn't like her flirting with other guys and she just kept saying I didn't do anything wrong. The next day, I went back home and we fought on the phone. I accused her of liking the guy and she said no, she flirted with him because she was angry at me for not moving to her place (We had this conversation before. I'd love to move but I can't right now because I'm still studying back home). The next few days, we kept fighting about it. I kept insisting that it was obvious she had feelings for him. After a while, she apologized and admitted she had a little crush but that she would stop talking to him. But they're coworkers, how can she stop talking to him...

So I don't know what to think of this. I really love her and we've been together for so long and this is just weird. But I'm not sure I trust her so much anymore. She basically lied about what she did for a week before fessing up. Am I justified in thinking all this is grounds for breaking up?

However she is the 2nd person I ever been with. This came as a shock at first, but I quickly dismissed it.

My gf has a bad sexual history. She was essentially raped, and used sex to cover up the pain. She tells me that sex with random people was a way to just check things off her bucket list.

She's always told me she didn't know why she liked him, says hes a bad guy and cheats, etc. So a few days ago, she went to a work event or something with him and she told me the day after. But yesterday, one of her best friends tried to hint at something, and her friend eventually told me that my gf cheated with the guy on the weekend on a different day. He has a girlfriend. I read the text messages, and she said things like they had long passionate kisses, things led to another and they had sex in the car. She said both the kisses and sex were the best she's had. Ouch.

So the relationship wasn't much of one from my understanding but she loved him regardless. 


When we initially got together the ex-bf seemed to distance himself from her, but that may have been because of school holidays and what-not. So once they were back at school together, he began to regret his mistake of cheating on her (which he initially didn't care about), and begun to cry about it and begun to self harm. Things quietened down for a while and recently have taken a turn for the worse. They text every so often but they're at school together so see each other everyday, but sometimes he will text or say to her he hates her, but then will say he loves her, regrets everything blah blah, the usual and will try and talk her into getting back together. Obviously hasn't worked. The ex-bf and a few of his friends often take the piss out of me, at least try to and apparently he hates me without having met me, except when i did come close to meeting him he quickly left. The ex-bf's friends are telling him to keep acting the same way to get her to go back with him which is just stupid, but they continue to be 'friends' which has never worked for me. She says she has to stay friends because they're at school but me and my ex saw each other every day and we never did anything of the sort.

Me and my partner are planning on getting married within the next two years. However we have had BIG differences in how we actually want to get married. We want to iron out these issues before we announce anything, and I need your help! NB - we are not engaged nor discussing this with our families. This is a pre-engagement issue that we want to resolve.

I wanted to elope. I have been to big weddings and I hate them. I don't want to dress up in a stupid white dress. I don't want a ceremony. I don't want any of that. It's about our love for each other, not parading it around.

He, on the other hand, wanted a larger wedding. Me in a white dress. He wants to invite his extended family and friends - say 100 people. I don't want anyone there that I haven't got to know at least a little bit. Let alone 100 people! 

So, we have made compromises. A small intimate wedding, with max 10 people either side - which will turn into more for him. I am still not happy with this, but ok. I know he's not entirely cool with it either. However, I do feel like I'm giving up more, especially financially. 

There is something we cannot agree on - I want the wedding childfree (important - we are childfree). My family has no small children. His has several. Most will be teenagers, however one will be still a toddler, and two will be around 12-13. To me, these are too young to attend a formal dinner. Especially the toddler. He thinks this will be a massive issue and will push away his relatives. I don't care any more - I wanted to elope and have a big party for all when we got back.

Help!

**Edit** Everything else is perfect. We agree on everything except this!

**Edit2** I don't actually want to get married (not because I don't love him! I do! But I don't see it as necessary). We would only need to get married for travel/visa purposes - i.e. I will work abroad at times and he would want to visit, and we would need to be married for that to be legal in this country.

**Edit3** Thank you for all your responses, they have been incredibly helpful and helped me to see a lot of different perspectives. I've been called selfish - he has got some very strong ideas about other parts of the wedding (for example food), that I've given him full rein on. So we have been compromising! And neither of us have ever been big on weddings - he partially feels that he would have to invite certain family (you know, the usual, we invited cousin X so now we have to invite third cousin Y). And he has been tempted by eloping on a beautiful desert island!
I've realized the childfree thing wasn't the main issue, it was just the thing I was focusing on. Actually, I am just not comfortable with a big ceremony as it will mean sharing a very precious moment with strangers, which I really don't want to do. I am going to talk to my partner and suggest we have a very intimate ceremony with the people we are closest to. Then a big kickass party with whoever he wants afterwards.

761,37kzbm,"4 days now. I am still in a haze. Just can't bring myself to realise that all of it..all 7 years of it was a lie.

I am a medical student. Met this guy in college. He wooed me so hard that even our common friends swore that his love was true. I was not so sure. We met and talked sometimes though. But he pulled out all the stops..like guys can do when you prove to be tough chase. A few examples : 1)heard from sumbody I had fever and hadn't eaten anything. By the time I felt like eating, the canteen was closed. So were all the shops. God knows from where he got some cookies and a bottle of juice.  

2)Stood in the rain at my hostel gate for an hour because I wouldn't pick up his calls. 

3) He knew I loved milk chocolate, a kind which we didn't get where my hostel was. Got it for me..

4) A million other things. A millllion other things..hard to believe it was just a long con....


He was funny, made me laugh. We became good friends. And I could talk to him about anything and he would be supportive and understanding.

So..I said yes after a year and a half. On 2nd april 2008.
My reasoning : if a guy tries so long and so hard to woo you, there must be something genuine.

After a short period of happiness, things started changing. Almost imperceptibly. The communication became more and more guarded .  Often he said things that wounded me. I am a middle child, between two brothers. My family has petted me as the only girl. So..i thought it might be that i am used to too much coddling and he s just being normal.

Then came the quarrels. The frequent quarrels.



Then this realisation that he was different to me in public than when we were together. In public he was more..demonstrative. Came across as doting on me, which was hardly the case when we were alone.

Once,  just to rile him up, I told him that one of my school crushes has confessed his love for me and I am inclined too. He called me up in the middle of the night to abuse me and my kind of slutty girls. No slangs but not much farther..


Multiple accusations by other girls that he was  a bit too sweet on them. Some of it , I took as banter. But about the more serious ones, when I asked him, he said they were jealous of us as a couple. it was obvious really..but I was just too blind.


Then the fights got worse and worse. He wouldn't call me for days..and wen I called him , would pretend like there was nothing wrong. I cried and cried over the phone and he either laughed ( to indicate it was a silly , joking matter) or just ended the call.

In 2013, we got into a huge fight. He literally took my arm and dragged me away from his room n marched me to my hostel. I was crying and there were a lot of ppl around.  Most of them knew us.

Didnt talk to him for a month after this. Then he called me asking for forgiveness. I asked him if he would hv forgiven such behaviour. His response : yes. a million times.

That should've told me. But no. Not me. I need lid retractors to open my bloody eyes.

On my b'day, he gave me a ring. I should've refused. But instead, I was touched( having the bad habit of always forgetting his tortures and remembering the sweet moments instead ). 

so..we were engaged. 

In march 2014, I had to go back home.  College was over. But I asked him if I should stay till 2nd april, to celebrate the anniv together.  He said if you hv to go, you should go asap.  But I stayed. 
     One day before the anniversary, I went to the mall to get him some gifts. He never gave me any. On b'days or anniversaries or valentine's days.. 

However, coincidentally, he asked me to go to a movie around tha same time I had to go do the secret shopping. So, I refused.  Then he asked me wat was I going to do and with whom. I refused to tell him. I got the gifts and then we went out to dinner with our friends. He got angry at me sumhow and dragged me from the restaurant after we had already ordered. And that was a bike ride from hell. 11'o clock at night on a highway, he was driving like the furies and stopping to yell obscenities on me, while I sat pillion and cried. I can still remember the way the wind blew my tears around my face and into my hair...
    The tl;dr of his rage : that I am having ' good times' with god knows how many guys...

And all this when I had gone to get him a gift and it was our last night together for an indefinite time.  He didnt even apologise when he got the gifts and I told him what was the reason I ddnt go to that movie.

Still I stayed with him. Because, you know, love.

I came home. He hardly calls me. Gets frustrated over small things. But  hey,long distance is tough.


4 days ago, he gave me his fb password to check some urgent messages. He couldn't access them from where he was.     And then I came across his messages to these two girls.  Messages late at night asking if she missed him n how much..why she wasn't picking up his calls...messages asking her to come early because he was waiting to pick her up at the station...saying things like don't worry, life s for enjoying...about sending her chocolates because it was her b'day...asking her to come for a romantic long drive in the cool weather....saying how it was a great day for him because she was coming n dat he would order a huge cake..dat he loved her...

Things he used to say to me. In the beginning.

The biggest tragedy was these messages began back in 2013.  And they knew each other way before that...
  I was still in college in 2013 with him.  He gave me a ring in 2013.


I called him. Asked who she was. He said she was his girlfriend and laughed. (the bastard was always cheeky. part of his charm, I thought.)


I asked him not to contact me. Ever.

Guys, he didn't even try.  Just gave up ,saying  please try to trust me. but ok i'll do as u wish. sorry i am not perfect for you. 

And then he has the nerve to ask for my help in a work related matter today. 

What cuts me up the most about it is that I really thought he loved me truly.  That is why I bore up with everything for so long.  But as it turns out..it was a 7 year long con.

978,27t6li,"Me and my ex-gf were dating for almost 6 months. We havent had alot of arguments but some of them were bad. Some of these fights she proceeeded to call me a coward, a pussy, a terrible bf, and has tried to make me choose between her or my friends which I have known for over a decade and care about very much. With any other bf im sure they would of ended it then and there but I stuck with it because I loved her and still do.

Yesterday she told me she wanted to talk and she explained to me that she didnt trust me because I lied to her yesterday (She asked me if I had whacked off, I told her no and when she asked again I told her I did) and she went off the handle saying I lied to her about stupid shit so who knows if I lied about something big. I tried explaining it to her that I didnt know why I lied about what she asked and told her anyway because it was a dumb lie and didnt want to drag it on.

After that she just continued to berate me, insisting she could no longer trust me and didnt want to be with me anymore. When I walked outside to talk to her some more she continued so I said maybe we should see other people. She gave me no fight, walked inside and grabbed her stuff, and later told me she did want to keep dating. After that it was over, she didnt want to talk to me and said very mean things to me in the process. 

I should also note that I have trusted her from day 1. She talks to multiple dudes and several of them were exes, she didnt hang out with them as far as I know but I told her I trusted her and only mentioned that I didnt like some of the dudes she was talking to and she stopped talking to them.

Later that night she asked me to come over so we could talk. Instead I sat there and got yelled at for about an hour saying it was my fault this happened and told me I get dudes txting me all the time, I wont be lonely after that I knew it was done, I wasnt interested in dating her anymore, to me the cons far outweighed the benefits and I did not try to win her back. I listened to what she had to say, gave her a hug and went home.

And this isnt the first major argument we have had, they have been rare but I am always the one at blame when it happens and anything I ever say just makes her more mad, and when I say something she gets mad even still. 

I feel that I made the right call. After this argument I felt that she had no respect for me at all and if she did still want to date she would've of tried something to change the fact. On top of the insults and other issues I have had with her in the past I still feel it was the best course to take. The problem is is that I still love and care about her very much but didnt know what else I could've done

792,2ad93c,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but it seems like a solid place to get some advice. I apologize in advance, this is going to be a long post. Any input is appreciated.
 
I’ve been dating my boyfriend now for about 8 months, but I have known him for 9 years. Only about 2 months before we started hanging out and a little over 3 months before we started dating, he got out of a tumultuous 3 year relationship with a girl he has known since middle school. Recently, this ex-girlfriend has contacted me via Facebook. Please keep in mind I have never met this girl in my entire life.
 
Even before she messaged me on Facebook, she would post tweets about how I’m a lame bitch, ugly, and so on and so forth. Some of these nasty posts were well before my boyfriend and I were even dating. My boyfriend has always been pretty open about his relationship with her. Despite her cheating on him with multiple men throughout their relationship, he seldom plays the victim card. He was no angel either and it definitely takes two to tango. It sounds like they both played their part to make the last year of their relationship a giant shit storm.
 
Back to the Facebook messages… She messaged me about 5 or 6 very long and extensive messages over the course of the day. In brief, she screen shot’d his Tinder profile (I know he has Tinder), blamed my boyfriend for her previous antics, and told me she’s here to “help [me] be strong” and “break his vicious cycle.” Most importantly, she claimed that my boyfriend has been cheating on me. Of course this made me incredibly upset and I couldn’t stop crying. I didn’t and still don’t understand her motivation to message me in the first place acting like my friend when she has done nothing but cyber bully me in the past. I also can’t even begin to put myself in her shoes and imagine messaging my ex-boyfriend’s current girlfriend whom I've never met under any circumstances. My boyfriend happened to be over when she messaged me and while I have never had previous suspicions of him being unfaithful, I obviously asked him if he has ever cheated on me. He said he has not.
 
I finally calmed down, but it was all I could think about. A couple days later I decided that I would feel better if I stuck up for myself and maybe it would give me some kind of closure. I didn’t cuss her out, I didn’t call her names, or anything like that. I was brief, but clear. Firstly, I told her that the emotional distress of her breakup didn’t MAKE her post mean things about me, but that was in fact a CHOICE and that she should take more responsibility for her actions in that regard. Secondly, I said that I do not need her to “help [me] be strong,” or act like she’s a friend lending a helping hand because she does not know me. Then I told her when someone doesn't respond, that typically implies that you should not continue to send them messages. Finally, I said what’s between my boyfriend and me is simply between my boyfriend and me and told her to never contact me again.
 
Of course she did in fact contact me. She responded instantaneously and cussed me out, called me ugly (which is kinda funny because she’s always posting shit like “LuV UrSeLf, Kn0w uR pReTtY,” but apparently you can pick and choose when you want to be body positive. ANYWAY), told me I've clearly struggled with insecurities my entire life (once again, never met this girl, ever), said I was a dumb bitch, poked me (?), and other various immature things.
 
It’s kind of amazing how her Ghandi-like intentions to act for the greater good suddenly disappeared. I did not respond and have absolutely no plans to contact her in the future. It has been about a month and a half since this Facebook exchange. Since then my boyfriend has blocked her number, deleted his Tinder (even though the fact he had a Tinder profile didn’t bother me), and has kind of taken a hiatus from all social media… all of this without me asking. He used to be reasonably active on both Twitter and Instagram. But his ex is like… Miss Wanna-Be-Bad-Bitch-Selfie-Instagram-Queen and constantly tweets so I think his absence on social media is further attempts to distance himself from her. However, she continues to tweet about my boyfriend and me saying things like she could say all this shit about my boyfriend but doesn’t care enough to ruin his current “relationship” (in quotes, how cute), how she’s encouraging him to have one night stands, that I clearly just hate myself, among many, MANY more things.
 
While I know it is entirely possible that my boyfriend could have/could be cheating on me (it’s always a possibility), I don’t think believing his ex is really an option for me. And for the most part, she was “revealing” things to me that I already knew (i.e. Tinder profile). Furthermore, I feel like her lack of evidence or detail as well as the nature of her response to my message proves she wasn’t being genuine. While I can’t imagine contacting my ex-boyfriend’s current girlfriend whom I’ve never met to tell her that he’s cheating on her, I don't think I'd respond the way she did if I was in fact just trying to let her know what’s going on. I feel like I would just think like ‘oh well, I tried to warn you. Your problem now.’ I also trust that if he in fact is cheating on me, the truth will reveal itself soon enough. Most importantly, I trust him. While I’m glad I am able to think things through without getting insanely upset, I’m annoyed that I’m even thinking about it at all, y’know? I know there’s no way to make her stop, I just want to find a way to move forward. I’m doing my best to not check into her social media sites, but it is hard. I don’t understand why she is so hell-bent on tearing us apart.
 
My boyfriend thinks she is upset that he moved on more quickly than either of he or his ex-girlfriend thought he would (although we both wish we have re-entered each other’s lives just a couple months later, perhaps when the dust had settled a little more from his previous relationship with this girl because then maybe none of this would have happened). A more likely explanation is that a few months back, his ex-girlfriend was talking to some guy and my boyfriend messaged him (equally stupid, but this ex-girlfriend used to bring out the most childish, immature side of my boyfriend once upon a time and he was tired of her butting into our relationship and posting mean stuff about me on public forums. At any rate, he should have never messaged this guy in the first place). My boyfriend told this guy she was talking to that his ex-girlfriend has an STD and that he should probably be careful (even his ex-girlfriend’s friends say she has recently contracted herpes… and YES don't worry, I have been tested recently). So this was possibly her attempt to get back at him months later.
 
This is all just really fucking stupid and exhausting. I’m doing my best to not let it get the best of me and I don’t want to become paranoid because I know that will surely ruin my relationship with my boyfriend. I’m just looking for advice to move forward. Some days I am able to brush it off and am just like “whatever, she’s the one with the problem, not me,” and other days I get so caught up with emotions and just simply cannot understand why his ex-girlfriend is doing these things. While my boyfriend and I have had our issues just like any other couple, he always assures me about how much I mean to him. People always talk about how when we’re together, we act like were also best friends… giving each other a hard time, being goofy, and making one another laugh. I have never spent so much time with one person before as I have with my boyfriend. We both love music and have gone to many concerts with one another, my friends from all over (I went to school halfway across the country and also lived in Germany for a short while) adore him, we have traveled to various places together, and we have resolved a lot of other problems that we’ve gone through. We haven’t been dating for very long (although he is my first boyfriend, so I guess it’s long for me lol) and I know this is something that most couples never need to deal with, but he does make me happy. I’m generally well-liked and a pretty secure person so this entire situation is foreign to me. I wanna forget about her because the only way to make an attention whore go away is to not give her anymore attention. I just want a method or something to help me cope on the days her hateful words get to me because I don’t see her stopping anytime soon.

**tl;dr**: My boyfriend's ex girlfriend subtweeted and cyber bullied me for months, even before my boyfriend and I started dating. She recently sent me a handful of long messages via Facebook with various claims including infidelity. I messaged her back a couple of days later asking her to not contact me again, but of course she did. She simply cussed me out and called me names. This Facebook exchange happened about a month and half ago and yet she still continues to make fun of me, my boyfriend, and our relationship. It usually doesn't bother me, but some days it seems to catch up to me and REALLY bring me down. I'm looking for a method or advice to help me get through the tough days.

217,2ftqtc,"Before anyone lectures us about our age difference please understand that we have heard it all, and although it really does bother us to a certain extent, it haven't changed our feelings toward each other. Our relationship started because she lived with me while I was in college and we began having a sexual relationship that eventually developed into love. I would have never considered someone so young, yet she understood me and she is very mature for her age. 

My ex gf and I broke up a month ago. Whenever we were together, we were the happiest couple barring a few arguments here and there. She goes to school in another state and I am currently working in the city. While she never really told her friends about us, (since her friends are mostly international students who aren't open minded about our age difference), all of my friends know who she is. Due to these circumstances, we mutually agreed to break it off a month ago. She wanted to explore what college had to offer and I want to have a life of my own without having to wait for her. 

However, for the past 3 weekends after we broke it off, we have been visiting each other because we can't stand the thought of being without one another. She is a very attractive girl, and she has many suitors already lined up for her, but she rejected each one of them one by one only so she can be with me over the weekend. She even took a 4 hour bus to get here and back just so she can spend a day with me. I still have very strong feelings for her, to the point where I feel sick every time she leaves. Living with her for a bit more than year have made us very reliant on one another. She was pretty much my wife for a good 16 months. 

So now I do not know what to do. We agreed that once she gets done with school, if our feelings are still mutual, I would propose to her and we would get married. But that will be another 3 years down the road. I know feelings might change and no one can ever predict the future, but I don't know what to do about our present situation. We literally feel like we can't live without one another and we still talk on the phone everyday. It makes it extremely difficult to get over one another and, since she knows my family and we took care of one another for so long, it felt more like a unwilling divorce than a break up. I don't need any lecture on our age and long distance because it is very possible for us to see each other every weekend, but I do not want to rob her of her college experience and be a nuisance to her. I simply need some advice, reddit, on what my mentality should be in this situation, how I can be strong enough to not visit her every weekend, and how to keep our potential future a possibly.

He always put himself first and threw tantrums when he wouldn't get his way.

I know this wasn't a healthy or good relationship but it did start out well. We've just grown apart, he's been unhappy and I could sense it so that made me insecure which made him angry. I just need some reassurance that I'm not as worthless as I feel right now. Thanks...

I interviewed with her, and she offered me the job.  But something was off.  The way she talked about my dad bothered me.  She made it clear that they were *good* friends, and that didn't sit right with me.  I didn't take the job, and my dad was upset with me.

In November, my dad was arrested.  This is nothing new with him as he's been arrested multiple times for DUI.  Wanting answers, I checked his texts and discovered that he and his coworker were having an affair.  This was not a huge shock since I had already met her, and this was not my dad's first affair.  About six years ago he had a very brief affair with another woman.  My mom found out, and he ended it.  My parents kept that affair a secret from my sister and me, but I found out anyway.

I, not knowing what to do, kept this new affair a secret, but I continued to go through his texts.  He would usually erase his messages, but sometimes he wouldn't.  They would sext one another, tell each other that they love each other, and talk about how their relationship is not an indictment on either marriage but is a meaningful connection full of love and trust and giving.

Last night, he caught me reading his texts over his shoulder, and I, tired of the secrets, confronted him about it.  He told me that I should respect his privacy and should not have been reading his texts.  He said that I don't know the whole story.  He said that he's in the process of ending things with this other woman, but it's delicate and has to happen a certain way because she has things on him.  He wouldn't go into any detail about what these things are.  He told me not to insert myself into this.  He said, I'm asking you, my son and a fellow man, not to tell your mom or sister.  Don't end this family.  I didn't promise him anything, but I said I haven't said anything in months and left it at that.

My family keeps secrets from each other; especially from my sister who has no idea any of this is going on.  She doesn't know about the affair.  She doesn't know that he was arrested in November.  She doesn't know that he was arrested the last three times he was arrested.  She doesn't know that he cheated the last time.  She adores our father.  I don't want to ruin her image of him.  But I don't want to lie to my mother who has always been there for me through everything.  Always supportive, always patient.  I think she deserves to know, but I don't want to break her heart.  And I also don't want to betray my dad.  He's been a good father even though he's a lousy husband and an alcoholic.  But I don't know if I can keep this secret.

537,325w0g,"Hi everyone.

About 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder called schizophrenia. Shortly after my psychotic break, I moved in with him and was 100% dependent on him... financially, emotionally, etc. We had agreed that was not a good place to be, but he is a wonderful man and he let me be fully dependent on him while we paved the way to my own independence. So far, so good.

He has gone through hell to be with me and help me become independent. Sometimes, the disease made me believe that my medicine was poison, and that everyone I knew wasn't real, and that made me lash out on those I love. I was hospitalized many times - it was a really awful year.

Now, I haven't had a psychotic episode in over a year. I got my own car (and the clearance to drive), I am enrolled in school for the fall, and I take my medicine every day and drive myself to my therapists and don't fight with them anymore. Financially, I make a little money online which helps me pay my share in rent and groceries. (He is in a MUCH better financial situation than me, so he usually insists on paying a higher percentage of bills and such)

We are both moving schools. He is going to grad school, and I'm finishing my undergrad at the same university (as you can imagine, my education was put on hold for quite a while.) I don't have a job yet, and he is a bit nervous about me getting a job my first semester back in school. We both want to ease into it. 

The past few months, we have been talking about marriage. After long discussions, he said that he decided to propose to me once I became independent enough to live on my own. He said he already knows I am marrying him because I want to and not because I'm dependent, but he wants us more on equal ground. So basically marriage can be on the table for us anywhere from weeks to years.

I don't really know how to show him I am independent when we are living together. I know there are probably lots of ways, I just need some suggestions. I love him and would like to get engaged soon, but not married right away. But the engagement has given me a real incentive to show him the best me possible.

My (20 yo) boyfriend and I (21 yo) go to the same college. We've been dating for 7 months now. I'm his first girlfriend. He's my 2nd. 

He has a not so nice past. Him and his guys were basically jerks to girls. I met him in circumstances where I didn't know all that. He's a great person and treats me with a lot of respect. But when he talks about his past, it makes me very uncomfortable. He basically used to hit and quit. It's all about who's hot or not. He looks around a lot and sizes people up. and with girls, no one was good enough for him, and no one was going to pin him down. 

Well ok, whatever, he's different now. He found somebody he likes and he's seeing things differently. We still haven't said the 3 words, but one day he said that he can't explain it, but when he says he likes me he comes very close to saying he loves me, which is a big deal for him. 

He has a close girl friend back home. But he hooked up with her too. He basically hooked up with almost every girl he considers as his friend. 
And this specific friend, he said that it was platonic, and they would hook each other up with other people... but all the details got me uncomfortable. 
One night, I got really upset about many things (I'm very jealous and possessive, and I hate that) and I asked to see how they text.
They haven't talked in a little bit, but I really did not like the messages. You would think they are a couple. She says she loves him. They miss each other... 

I know there is absolutely nothing. And he would never cheat. But my jealousy kills me. I get really mad and upset easily when he talks to her or any of his other girl friends. In school too, he hooked up with a lot of girls before starting to date me... 

This summer he will be home, and he will be with all these 'close friends' and it bugs me so much. When I see old pictures of him and all these girls, it gets me really mad. 

I don't know, my post may not be really clear, I don't know how to better explain all this, but I really don't like his old ways and history and most of his friends back home. Add that to me being very jealous and possessive, and I'm just mad and upset so many times for small things. He really likes me and does everything to make me happy. But I feel like in the long term it might affect the relationship.

13,28dy9x,"First off, I honestly wasn't sure which subreddit to post this in, so I apologize if it's not really appropriate here. Incoming behemoth of text!

A little back story: I was 20 when I met him. I had dated other guys before, but I was still a virgin. Four months later, after I had turned 21 and he had (awkwardly but adorably) told me he loved me, and I him, we finally had sex. Up until then we had just been playing around like a couple of high school kids, heavy making out and touching and experimenting with oral (but no penetration on my part) so this was a big step for me. Admittedly my first time was extremely painful, as nothing had ever been inside of me before, not even a tampon.

As we continued to have sex, it always has felt great to me. Yeah, I'm a noob and dont know how to put my knees behind my head and suck an egg through a hose like some of his exes, but we both always seemed to enjoy it and have a wonderful, loving bonding experience from it. 

The problem is, despite it always feeling good, I have had maybe 3 real orgasms in the last 2 years. I kinda figured it was normal because you see all those sitcoms where the guy finishes and the wife is left sitting in bed, unsatisfied, and it's comic relief. I also never bothered to say anything, because he always seemed so proud and satisfied of himself afterwards, and I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

Well this weekend we had finished having sex, and he started to go down on me. I panicked and pushed him off, because sometimes he gets a little too rough and the feeling isn't painful, it's just uncomfortably intense. I told him I didn't feel like it, and he seemed to get offended. He said I just want to satisfy you. I enjoy watching you orgasm.

This is where it started. I am HORRIBLE at keeping secrets if people relate the conversation around it in a sense, even innocently. Example:  Say I would eat the last cookie in the cookie jar, and someone would say Did you eat this? **no.** Okay. Oh well, I'll just make more. **...okay** I better wash the cookie jar out before I put more in though. **OKAY IT WAS ME!!**

So I replied to him not to worry about it. He kept insisting that he LOVES seeing me orgasm, the noises and faces I make, etc. I kept insisting that it doesn't matter if I get off or not, just drop it. He kept pushing and asking me Why I didn't want to have an orgasm. I replied that he didn't know that I didn't have one, and he said he can tell when I fake them. I asked him how he knew, and he said The few times you have faked it, you just tilt your head to the side and close your eyes and moan. I can tell. You always arch your back and bite your lip when you have a real one. (Maybe I'm good at faking them after all?)

The back and forth kept going on and on until I felt like I HAD to get it off my chest. I admitted to him that I've only had three and I've been faking them all the last two years, BUT I went on to tell him that, despite not having orgasms, I very much enjoy the sex, it feels good and I love bonding with him, and that's what matters to me. I told him, it's like I get 3/4ths of the way up the mountain, but I never hit the peak. I told him that when I take care of things myself it usually takes me a good 45 minutes before I can get myself there (which I almost always do) and I don't want him to waste his time just because I need a LOT of time and stimulation.

He seemed a little sad at first, and didn't realize I had been faking so much, but told me that if I didn't have a problem with it, it's okay with him, but he's still like to try to make me have them. I feel horrible about this! I wish I would have never said anything, because I deeply feel that this is going to hurt our relationship. I kept asking him all weekend, and he said it doesn't bother him, and not to worry about it, but **I** feel that if the tables were turned and he told me I couldn't make him orgasm, I would feel un-sexy and worthless.

I read all these things about people having to have both a good sex life AND emotional life to make a relationship work, and now I feel like I've ruined it. I'm afraid that he's just saying that he's okay with it so he won't hurt my feelings, but I just want him to be happy. I should note that otherwise, we have a fantastic relationship. I just dont want him to go the rest of our lives thinking I can't even pleasure my girlfriend.

 I really feel bad, and I want to get it across to him that I enjoy sex, and I don't want him to feel worthless or bad just because he can't get me to that point. How can I help BOTH of us feel better about the situation, or, if possible, fix the problem?

My SO and I are very reverse stereotypical when it comes to sex. He has sex when he wants, I have sex when I can. He is always delaying the act or putting it off like it's a chore. We will be making out in the living room about to go to the bedroom, and he will say something like oh I just have to take a shower or I haven't worked out yet, I need to do that or will just blow me off altogether by talking about groceries or something.

Here are the facts. My husband and I are friends with My friend and her husband. We are all in our late twenties, and we are close (ie- I met her in high school, they both were in our wedding party, they come over for dinner several times per month, random game nights, ect). They have been together for 8 years, and have been married 2 years. Earlier this year, she cheated on her husband. For the past 5 years, they have been in a dead bedroom type of marriage, and she (being a VERY sexual person) was unhappy, and she made that very clear to him. Prior to her cheating, he did agree to go to therapy, and try to get help, but nothing seemed to make a difference, and I guess after a year or so, she got tired of waiting, and had sex with an ex on several different occasions, who she did not have any emotional connection with, it was strictly sex. When she first told me I got really upset, not only because her husband is a genuine nice guy and did not deserve that, but also because I found myself in a position where I didn't know what to do. I decided to think it over for a day or two, and evidently she told more than just me, and another friend of hers went straight to her husband and told him everything. Then, I felt like an ass because he learned that I knew, but never said anything to him. I apologized to him so much because I know that if I were in that situation, I would want someone to tell me. Being the nice guy that he is, he decided to give her another chance, she said that it would not happen again, and he agreed to try harder to be intimate with her more often. Fast forward 8 months, he is still in therapy, they have had sex 1 time, and she got tired of waiting again. I just learned that she is cheating with a different person that she met at her new job. This time however, she admitted that divorce is imminent, and she is emotionally and physically attracted to this new person, and she goes over his house quite frequently when his wife is away. She flat out lies, and tells her husband that she is going over a female friends house to hang out (sometimes overnight) but IRL she is going to visit him and cheat. She said that she is going to talk to him about getting a divorce, but has to wait because right now she is not able to support herself (I know, that is fucked up). She said that she dose not want to mention cheating because it would hurt him too much and that she just wants to separate from him (dose not want his money, assets or possessions, or anything like that), and start living a life where she is happy, and feels loved, even if it is not with the guy she is currently sleeping with. They are the kind of people that most likely will have an amicable divorce.  This time she has only confided me, and I am struggling because I want to do the right thing. 


On one hand, I want to tell him, because he is my friend, I care for him, and I know that if I was in his shoes, I would hope someone would tell me. I have also lost a lot of respect for her, and honestly am questioning if I should continue the friendship with her (my husband does not want us hanging around with her anymore, and I can understand why). 

On the other hand, I question if it is my place to interfere in their marriage. They both have issues that have led to this point, and while I think cheating is a shitty thing to do, I do understand where she is coming from, and I would hate being in a marriage where I felt ugly and unloved because my husband won't touch or kiss me.  

My husband btw, 100% wants to to tell him.

So Reddit, please help, what do you think I should do? What would you do?

I know that there are people who are in similar situations as my friend, and they don't cheat, they make better decisions, and work through it like adults.

853,2q0mq2,"Throwaway here. I've been dating J for about 4 months. We met at a tango class and have been seeing each other and dancing a lot since then. Things have been going really well and our future prospects seem really good. 

J has a close friend and dance partner, M, who he would bring to tango classes quite a bit. They are both more experienced dancers and tend to dance together a lot at tango events. This would occasionally annoy me because M would never talk to me and our few conversations were somewhat awkward, and I didn't really understand her friendship with J. When we first started dating, J and M would hang out at least once a week on top of seeing each other at tango 2-3 times a week.

I asked J if he and M had a history together, and all he told me was that they briefly dated.

J and M are currently in Argentina together. They had been planning this tango-centric trip to Buenos Aires for some time, and are sharing an apartment for 5 weeks together. They have been going out dancing nearly every night for the week and a half they have been there so far. I was really unhappy about him being gone for so long, particularly with someone he had a history with, but I didn't want to make him cancel a trip that had been planned before he’d met me, so I lived with it. I was open with him about my displeasure about his trip and we talked about it many times.

A few days after they left, I happened to talk to a mutual friend of mine and J's about the trip. The mutual friend asked if I knew about their history. It turned out that J and M had met much earlier than J had told me, and that they had started dating while J was still living with his wife (J is divorced). J and M were together until about 8 months ago and dated for several months before that. J spent some time traveling after that, and M stayed in his house and took care of his dog while he was gone. I feel that J completely mischaracterized his relationship with M to me, since I did not know about any of this. Still, he technically did not lie to me about anything.

When I brought this up with J, his first reaction was to chastise me for talking about him and M behind his back. He said that I could have asked him any specific questions about M and he would have told me. His initial reaction was annoyance that he had to alter his evening plans to skype with me about this issue, and it felt unfair that he was trying to make me feel bad about this.

He will be in Argentina with M for another month, and I am really concerned that he is going to be unfaithful to me, particularly because he slept with this woman before he and his wife split up. I don’t see why he wouldn't do it again. He has tried to assure me that this is not the case and that he and M have a strictly platonic relationship now, but because he was not forthright about his history with this woman, I don't have as much trust for him anymore. Other than him being on this trip with M and their weird friendship, there was nothing bad about our relationship, yet I am starting to consider ending my relationship with him because of how much stress this trip is causing me. Am I being jealous and unreasonable? Do I have genuine reason to be concerned?

So I'm in a relationship with a [28F] named Erica. We've been together for about 1.5 years and we moved into a house together last fall. Since I don't earn much (working part time as I finish grad school), she owns the house but I pay her half the mortgage/bills and help around with maintenance and chores as much as I can. We aren't married.

Lately, (in the last few months). I've become interested by Samantha, [21F]. Neither my Erica nor Samantha know this. I'm worried this could end what is an otherwise good relationship. Erica and I get along great. We communicate well, we enjoy each other's company and we have very compatible lifestyles. 

Still I can't seem to help but think that there's something missing from our relationship. While everything seemed perfect during the honeymoon phase, now I'm starting to doubt our relationship for a few reasons. I'm not so sure I want children anymore (my views have changed since we started dating) and Erica does. She's mildly aware of this. Erica would like to move to another city to get closer to her family and I'm not so keen on the idea because it would mean moving away from mine. She's very aware of this, but both of us have decided let's keep going and see where things go. I've also been getting annoyed by her lately because I feel (and I may be wrong) that she tends to believe her opinion is the truth. When I contest statements she makes, instead of backing them up, she'll accuse me of enjoying arguing. 

Erica and I work for the same company. While we don't work directly together most days, there would be occasional interaction nonetheless. 

As for Samantha, we're friends. We met about a year ago when she moved here. 

I feel awful about all of this. What's worse is that I've noticed it's a bit of a recurring problem. I date someone for an extended period of time, I notice a problem in our relationship, I end up becoming interested in someone else, and I usually end up dating them a few months later. My dating life has been the result of this pattern for the last 10 years. 

How can I deal with this by causing the least amount of pain to everyone? How do I stop this cycle from recurring?

I don't want to hurt Erica. I do still feel something for her. Am I still in love with her? I don't even know anymore. For the record, nothing's happened with Samantha other than occasional conversation (we are in the same social circles... end up at the same social events... have many mutual friends). Still, I can't stop thinking about her... probably even more than I think about Erica. 

I don't want to be unfaithful to Erica, but it's taking me everything I have. Sorry for being a sleaze ball.

That rush of excitement before we met in person for the first time and every time we went to pick each other up from the airport was once of the greatest feelings I have ever experienced, and I couldn't stand saying goodbye.


Two years ago, just before I was going to graduate high school, my mom was hospitalized for the final time, because of a liver condition. She went into surgery for a transplant, and my GF flew out of Illinois immediately to come and be with me during the surgery. She arrived a few hours before my mother passed away.


My GF (I'll call her R) stayed with me after she died, even though she just started a new job out in IL. She went home for a month or so later on to bring her stuff here, but moved in with me and my dad and brother who moved out shortly later. My dad is rarely around, so it was really just us together. For two years, I was the happiest guy I could be when I was with her. I was dealing with the loss and all the stress that comes with it, but it was like being married, and I was over the moon. We're living together, end up working at the same place, and even socialize together with the same friends - this is part of why I believe I started to take her for granted, unintentionally.


Cut to 2 years later. R and I are happy, but there seems to be a little less sexual interaction (we're both abstinent, her for religious and me for personal reasons, but are still sexually active), we don't go on as many dates, it's kinda mellow between us. So, I come home and ask her whats up, and she drops the bomb that she wants to be on a break, even though we're still living together. The next 3-4 months are filled with constant worry about whether or not she loves me, constantly trying to figure out what was in her head since she always responded with I don't know how I feel. 


She told me at the onset of the break that she felt I was being too selfish and that I was changing. I was very focused on myself and the things that make me happy because my mom was gone and all that stuff, but I concede that I was being selfish. I tended to sit and play my guitar or a video game more than to go cuddle with her, which I greatly regret.


I spent the next few months telling her through letters and discussions that I was sorry if she felt pushed away, that I was going to do whatever was necessary to show her that I love her and am crazy about her and want to make her happy. Once I came back from the visit to her parents this new year's, I decided to ask her to marry me once I'm done with college (2 yrs). I spend time adding songs to the list we made to play during our wedding, planning out decor, how I'm going to propose, things like that. During the break, I try my best to show her she's still the most important person in my life. I realize I was taking her for granted and do my best to show her that I would never do it again.


A few nights ago while housesitting for a friend, I send her a text thanking her for staying with me even though she misses home and her family and all that. She responds that even though things are different now, she appreciates the thank you. I rush home to talk to her, and we officially break up. Her reasoning was that she felt I had changed too much, and that she was no longer in a place to be in a committed relationship, that she needed to find out about herself.


Here I am, ready to marry this woman in January, and now waiting for her to move out in 2 weeks and probably never see her again. I am beyond torn apart, and can't bear with the thought of being with another woman. She was the one, the person who made me so happy and found so attractive and loved being around. I just loved thinking about her, even if we weren't together. I think somewhere deep down I knew this was going to happen, even if I did everything I could to convince myself we were going to work and be happy. Now I'm faced with life without the only woman I've ever loved, who I got along with so well. She satisfied some of my less-conventional sexual desires, she made me feel special and wanted, we were so happy together, even the little things like her being the perfect height and size to me and our hands being the same size made me feel so good about her and us. Now I feel like my life is falling apart and I can never find a woman who will treat me the way she did and give me the things she did - to have someone who will leave little love notes here and there and sweet messages, who will just text me at random moments to tell me she loves me, be compatible with me sexually, all those things. My friends and family are all telling me this is for the best, and that things probably won't have worked out in the long term, but all I want is for her to have her time to think and mature, and to come back to me so we can be together. 


How do I overcome this? I feel like she and I were supposed to be together, that it was the divine plan for us to get married and have kids and all that (if you don't believe in those things, do try to avoid the eye-rolling). I literally have no physical or emotional desire to even try and be with another woman. R is the only one I want, even for her imperfections and things we disagree on, I still want her and can't get my head around her being with someone else, doing all the things we used to do, her having relations with another person when we were both each others' firsts (first woman I did anything sexual with, and only one for these 4+ years). She just wrote in her Valentine's Day card to me that she is so thankful that we met and that she can't wait to spend more Valentine's Days together and was so excited to live our lives together. Then, a month or so later, she goes on a break and a few months after breaks up with me.


Our relationship wasn't perfect, but it was pretty great I felt. We had good communication, we never pressured each other into anything we didn't want to do, we respected and loved and valued each other, we had our arguments and stuff but we always resolved it, always able to compromise, etc. 


Her dad is flying out to move her stuff mid-August, so I have to see her every day for the next couple of weeks. We're still good friends, and we've been each others' best friends for years - we know more about each other than anyone else alive, even our parents. I want to be connected to her but I can't stand the thought of not being romantically involved with her. I can't stand the thought of driving around my neighborhood and seeing all the places we used to go, thinking of all the things we used to do, or her doing those things with someone else.


I had started to plan my life around her. We were going to move back West, live somewhere near Chicago so we can catch the Blackhawks and Sox games, which I started to love after meeting her, and now I can't do that; it's like everything I believed in and planned is sitting in front of me behind this glass window, and I can't break it, it's too far out of reach. The things I used to enjoy don't bring me the same happiness because I always did them with her. I'm comfortable with who I am as a person and what I want out of life, and R is in all of them.

 
I'm basically an emotional, teary mess.

We officially were together in Jan 2012.  She's had chlamydia before and was treated for it (before we began having sex with each other).  She had a test done recently before we were together and it came out negative (she's clean).  4 months into the relationship, we started having sex without condoms.  About 3 months later, I go get tested for sti/std's, and I come out negative on all counts.  In May 2013, she gets her yearly pap/check-up and comes out good.  All good, right?

Fast forward to now (the incident happened about 3 weeks ago), we recently had a scare because she went down on me while she had a cold sore.  She gave me oral for a minute or so and proceeded to put my penis in her vagina...while late, my senses came back to me and told her we have to stop.  We both got tested a few days later.  Her blood came back negative and but her urine came back positive for chlamydia.  I am still waiting for my results this Thursday.

Likely, if she does have it, I possibly have it too.  But the question is, how would she have gotten it?  Lets rule out the cheating thing for now.  Would a UTI possibly cause a false-positive (I know they do separate tests for these)?  Mix-up at lab? Some other kind of false-positive?  It's impossible for me to give it to her because I have never been with anyone else.  Is her being unfaithful the only other thing?

Did she fool around me? Or could it have been a false-positive and she should get it retested?  Because I have no reason to believe she cheated and I do absolutely believe that she didn't.

There are just some things that he isn't willing or capable of doing that I would like to do with others, even sexually.

I met my girlfriend towards the end of my last year of high school, and I knew almost immediately after talking to her that she was an exceptional person. She is one of the kindest people I've ever met and the first person I've ever truly loved, and I wouldn't trade what we had for the world. What we had was really special and she would agree, we worked better than any relationship I had seen my friends and peers in. We just clicked. We absolutely had our disagreements but respected each other enough to settle them calmly and with tact, and as such we never so much as raised our voices at each other. Any issue we had we would address promptly and painlessly. We honestly had better communication than many of the marriages I've been exposed to. We were together for 8 months before leaving for college.

We ended up going to colleges an hour from each other (I have my car, she doesn't) and intended to tentatively try long distance to see if it would work. We both approached college in different ways, me trying to shape myself into the best person I could be and her trying to get the most out of the experiences. We tried long distance but all it seemed to do was remind us that we couldn't be the way we used to be and it just made us a little bit miserable. After about a month we both agreed that our relationship wasn't the best thing for us, and while our relationship was amazing in the parameters it was created, it didn't work when everything about it was different, especially since a lot of it depended on physical contact and having a blissful time together ignoring the rest of reality. We thought that the obligation to each other was holding us back from growing into the people we will eventually become, but if at some point we were in a position to date we would be happy to. It was a rather odd break up, as we both came out happy and on good terms. We broke up on the phone then had a conversation about our days, it was just bizarre.

We decided that we'd still be friends after breaking up. Just because we didn't want a romantic relationship doesn't mean we don't want to be in each other's lives. As such, we still talked a little throughout the day and kept each other in our lives. About a week later, she tells me she's begun to date someone she's met at school, and although she absolutely had every right to do so, it still crushed me a little bit that this person, this person who was and still is my rock and the person I had began to see my future with, could move on to someone else so quickly. I let her know that it was a difficult conversation for me, but I didn't mention the extent that it bothered me.

We both came home for Thanksgiving, and decided to meet up and catch up. We got dinner and had a pleasant conversation comparing experiences, but after dinner the conversation shifted to our relationship. 

At this point I had begun to separate us in my thoughts, imagining a future without her and planning my actions as such. She on the other hand, still imagined a future with me although her present involved someone else. And we talked about our relationship and our lives and everything and nothing and while we had this conversation I realized that although the situation we were in was really miserable... it was okay. The world could be on fire and it would still be okay so long as she was there through it with me. I could come to her after failing at everything I've ever tried and she would still accept me with open arms. The things she was saying were exactly what I needed to hear and she balanced me out and made me a better person. What we had forged over those 9 months was more than some good memories. We had created something I wanted to have for the rest of my life. With her next to me I could take on the world and I could fail and it would still be okay and she felt the same way. And the fact that we talked it all out and managed to get back into that little safe space that we'd created for each was so cathartic for both of us. She told me that she wants me in her future but she still wants to be able to experience other things now and how she knows how selfish it is. I told her how much dating that guy hurt me and we said everything we've been holding back from each other and we cried in each other's arms and it was awful and okay all at the same time because we were there for each other. 

When my problem arose is when the little bubble we'd created for each other once more began to disappear. We've decided to take a break from each other for a week or two so we can sort through our thoughts. She is dating someone else and we can't just starting dating again fueled on hope and sunshine. The chances of us spending our lives together are incredibly small and I understand that. Despite that, I would be happy to try long distance with a different approach; I'm willing to go through hell to keep this thing that people spend their entire lives looking for so long as we're going through it together, but she doesn't feel the same way. We weren't happy in long distance and she doesn't think a different approach would change that. She'd prefer staying where we are now, where we're still a part of each other's lives but not dating. I simply can't do that. I'm not willing to sit there on standby while she has her fun and I'm not the type to start another relationship for the fun of making a mistake, especially when I know that I'm just trying to forget her. If she isn't wiling to fight for what we're created then I'm not willing to fight for any future we might have. I have been and will continue to make myself into an individual with a plan for the future without her and the ability to face life without this person, as is healthy when a relationship ends. I am not willing to plan for a future with her if she isn't not willing to spend the present with me. I recognize the nature of our problem, and fear that these are the only two choices before us. I just feel like an ultimatum is a shitty way to handle any relationship situation, and I'm wondering if there's some other way of looking at it. What do you think reddit?

So obviously I have no problem with what she does and I know she is very committed to me but she truly does wear the most inappropriate clothing all the time. 
I'm no prude and slut-shaming is one thing that I would never do but I'm telling you, these tops are just so ridiculous. I'm not talking a bit of cleavage or even her fucking bra showing through a tank top (so hot)- I'm talking tons of side-boob, no bra, her entire back showing, oh, and its 30 degrees outside- she has multiple tops just like this. I love seeing her in it but I mean she wears it to really inappropriate events and just about every time we/she goes out. She knows im not attracted to it. she smiles in a menacing way every time she mentions this particular top which is the absolute main problem in all of this- because she knows i despise it. 

She knows I despise it and yet she is too proud of a woman to give in. She knows what I'm more attracted to (not that style of dress) and yet she its all SO laughable to her because she would never listen to anyone else about what to wear. And I'm not telling her what to wear! All I want is for her to respect me enough to try to make my life better and in this case it really is as simple as slightly altering her attire (which Is not something I think she is that attached to even). 
 I literally have her pick out all my clothes because I don't give a shit unless it makes her happy or its whatever she wants to see me in. That's the big one to me. I have talked ot her about this and she makes me feel like a slut-shamer every time, but I mean, do I not have a point that if she can't make a simple concession like that in this absolutely perfect relationship then does she really care? Its so different for genders but if something i was wearing even kind of made her uncomfortable the situation would be resolved in &lt;2 seconds as I tossed the outfit in the trash. She is so political and proud n her thoughts that she is just completely ignoring any simple/pragmatic solution. Of course its her prerogative to wear what she wants and I won't be the one to tell her not to wear something but this is a problem. How can I approach this in a respectful and effective way?

1059,2g2b0i,"Yesterday afternoon my boyfriend (of over a year) and a friend went to the bar together to watch baseball and have some drinks. One beer turned into quite a few and by the time I got off work, they were pretty tipsy. I went to the bar to pick him up and decided to stay for a bit and get some supper.
I also had a few drinks. I'm a really small person and I rarely drink, so when I do it hits me hard. After a while I was buzzed as well and we were all having a good time, chatting up the people around us and watching the game.

By the evening my boyfriend was quite drunk, as was I. Our conversations started to take a weird turn, and while I wasn't really capable of recognizing it last night, today I feel uncomfortable with a few things that he said. Here is a brief overview:

- He pulled me close and told me to pick a waitress for us to have a threesome with. I assume this was a joke because he knows that I don't especially want to have a threesome, but it felt a little like he was testing my boundaries.

- A few guys came over and offered to buy me a drink, which I declined. My boyfriend told me I should have accepted and that if he was a woman he'd drink for free if he could. I said I didn't need the validation, nor did I want to lead anybody on my accepting a drink when I had a boyfriend. He said not to tell them I had a boyfriend and use it to my advantage.

- Also during that conversation he said If I had your body, I would rule the world! Hot girls like you don't know the power they have over guys. I told him that he has the charisma to pull off world domination while I am very shy, and he replied that the only thing you are lacking is the personality.

- He asked if I thought I could score more phone numbers than he could. I said Most likely, I am an attractive female and the bar is mostly men anyway. I was already approached a few times that night and the demographic of the bar works in my favor. He then challenged me to see who could get the most phone numbers. I said it was a little inappropriate and I didn't want to flirt with guys as a dare, and he shrugged it off.

- We were playing a game by asking random patrons to suggest a shot for us to do. We'd take turns approaching somebody and ask them to suggest their favorite shot, the grossest shot they could think of, etc. If they played along we'd include them in the round and buy them a drink. There was a table of two obviously wealthy men sitting by us and my boyfriend dared me to ask them. They seemed pretty no-nonsense so I said I didn't want to bother them. When I was walking back from the bathroom, one of the men said they saw our game and suggested a drink to me. They then offered to pay, and asked if my friend would like one too. I called my boyfriend over and we ended up sitting at their table. They were very nice guys and a lot of fun, but my boyfriend didn't acknowledge me as his girlfriend whatsoever.

I was hammered but I never get so drunk that I don't remember, so I know what happened. Last night I was under the influence so I didn't really notice or care what was going on, but today it really bothers me. My boyfriend has a terrible memory to begin with, so I am certain that if I bring any of this up he won't remember it. He did say that last night was fun when I went to work this morning.

What should I do? I'm pretty bothered by what happened and what he said. I'd like to know the motivation behind it and hopefully set some boundaries but I don't know how to approach him about something that I a) wasn't bothered by last night and b) he probably won't remember

629,2ib6e1,"My ex-boyfriend and I have been best friends since I was 11, and we started dating when I was fourteen. We've been long distance for nearly four years, and it ended a few days ago.

Most of the reason for the breakup was the pressure of distance, but he also said that he's been having trouble trusting me recently. About 8 months ago, a male friend of mine kissed me while we were working on a school project at his house. I didn't stop him, but I didn't let it progress any further either and I told my ex what happened right away. I know that kiss obviously wasn't a good thing to do, but I thought we had talked that through and moved on. Apparently not. Even after breaking up, we're both still trying to explore what needs to happen in order for him to trust me again. Even if we're only friends, I want him to be able to trust me the way I trust him. 

We didn't talk at all for about 2 days post-breakup, but we've started talking again a little. I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing, but I also don't know how to not talk to him - he's been my best friend, main confidant, and a huge source of emotional support for essentially a third of my life now. Talking to him feels safe, and knowing that he still cares about me so deeply makes me feel better, but I'm worried this is going to interfere with my ability to move on. Things are still fresh, but I'm already finding myself starting to adopt (and really trying to combat) the opinion that I just need to give us some time, and then we can be back together. He did say that maybe we would find our way back to each other at some point and that he was absolutely open to dating again down the line, but I know I need to not wait for him. 

On the one hand, not talking seems like it might be best in the long run. On the other hand, all I want is to talk to him, even platonically. Even if it means hearing about other girls. I trust him so much, and it upsets me not to have someone I can tell everything to. He keeps contacting me as well - he doesn't want to lose contact or the support of our friendship either. 

My relationship with him was the most genuine, positive, supportive endeavor I could have asked for. I regret nothing about it, and that's making it even more difficult to move on. Sure, long distance was hard, and I understand that things we're working with us both being far away and busy, but I just really respect him as individual and he always helped encourage me towards self-improvement as well. 

I'm not really sure how to move forward from here in a way that promotes both of us healing as individuals. Ideally, I don't want to lose contact with my best friend, but at the same time I realize that might be necessary to do for a while until I can truly differentiate him as a friend versus a romantic interest. I'd really just like some advice on how to proceed from here.

I 22f currently have a friend 22f who I DO NOT want to be friends with any longer. We met last year at college and became very close because she was roommate and still currently my roommate now. 

The reason why I don't want us to be friends is that her personality literally drives me up the wall. Nothing is ever her fault, she can be mean to me whenever its convenient to her and she tries to steal my friends while ostracizing me. My friends however see right through what she's doing so that's not an issue.... But I can't help feeling uncomfortable as to why she needs to try to alienate me and cling onto my friends. When its just us two alone she act very kind to me, when other people are in the picture she's a totally different person.

She starts fights over the dumbest things, gets annoyed when you don't do things her way and makes snarky comments to make you feel bad. She's also very insecure about herself which she tells me about all the time. I've tried to salvage the relationship by talking to her about our problems and directly addressing it, but at this age I doubt she will change. 

So how do I go about removing her from my life when she lives with me and tries to be a part of my/friends social circle?

900,33za5a,"  So I'll try to keep this as need-to-know as possible, because otherwise, it could get long and hard to follow. This is my first post to here as a poster, so I hope this is easy to follow... I'm keeping it a bit vague because I feel like this'd be easily identifiable to anyone who knows me.... 

My godmother, I'll call her Ann, was like a second mother to  when I was a kid. She was good friends with my mom and worked with her and my family for years. She babysat me all the time and spoiled me rotten. I loved her, she was like family. She never married or had an SO or kids of her own, so I guess I was the closest thing she had to a kid. When I was young, my mom got sick. She struggled with her illness until I was 10. Eventually, she split with my father and we moved across the country to live with relatives so they could look after her and then-young me. A year after moving, my mom passed away and because I was young, her relatives kept me (to my understanding, Ann wanted to take me, but they argued that it'd be best to keep me where I was, rather than throw me around more). Contact with Ann kind of tapered off. She stopped returning emails when my relatives sent them (they really liked her, she was an awesome woman, the nicest). Quit answering calls. Kind of dropped off the face of the earth. 

I didn't keep in touch much over the years myself, because she didn't answer calls and I don't like phone calls to begin with, and I didn't have much computer access, or an email. When I got older, I sent Ann a few emails here and there asking how she is, saying I miss her, etc. Once in a while, I'd get an email back, respond, and then nothing back. Basically, getting a reply from Ann was VERY rare, and even then it wasn't much. I never did go back to visit because if I'm totally honest, I don't think I was ever ready to be back in my hometown without my mother.  

Fast forward a few years, I'm graduating high school. I invited her, because I thought that since my mother couldn't be there, she was the next best thing and that was what my mom would want. I got a reply, saying she was happy to hear from me; unfortunately, she had other commitments. She said we'd have to set up another time to either fly me to her, her out to me, or both of us fly somewhere and have a holiday to catch up. It stung, but I chalked it up to just that-- she had other commitments. Fair enough.

**Now**, a year ago, life happened and I made the decision to move back to this area on my own. I left my family and am mostly alone here. We (my relatives and I) all thought that of all people, she'd be happy to see me again. I guess this is where my first fuck-up was, I let myself get my hopes up. I thought that maybe she just didn't like emailing and once I was able to see her in person, we could rekindle. Since Ann was like a second mom to me, maybe I thought that we could be close again and she'd be like the mom I didn't have in my teens. Who knows. 

After arriving, I reached out to her. I contacted her sister (she was close with us as well when I was a kid, I have her on Facebook) and asked for her contact info. She told me she does not have a phone anymore (well she does, it's strictly for business, and does not give the number out...), the only way to reach her is when she's at work and/or by email. So, I sent Ann an email and said that I'm now living in the area (I'm in a city about a half hour from her), and asked if she'd like to go to dinner and catch up. I got an email back, saying she'd love to. I sent her my phone number, and she told me she'd be in touch when she was able to come down and go for dinner. I told her I was looking forward to it, and I was. I was beyond excited. Months pass......... Ann never called. I reached out again and asked if she was still planning to come by. She said yes, that she'd give me notice. This was in summer of 2014..... Ann still never called. Again. OR emailed, for that matter. I reached out in January, saying that I'd be in the area sometime soon and thought maybe we could get dinner and catch up then (in case her reasoning is because she didn't want to drive to my city. I was willing to go to her.). She said that no, it would be best to wait until she can come down. Keep in mind, this is in January 2015. 8 fucking months after I arrived here. Never even got a message to say hey, sorry, I've been very busy with work! Will be in touch soon!. I still haven't heard another word from her since. People at her work who know I'm in this neck of the woods have asked her when she'll see me (it was a VERY tight knit group at their work, they all know each other and saw each other outside work all the time). Ann just says soon.

It just stings, to this day, that she never called. I desperately want a relationship with her. I don't understand why Ann never called. I feel like it hurts even more because she told me she'd be in touch soon, and never was...... why tell someone that when you have no interest in being in touch? Why not just never answer? Basically, /r/relationships , what I need help with........ what the hell do I do now? Do I give up any hope of ever seeing her again? How do I make it stop hurting? People that knew my family see me, and it never fails, they say oh, I remember when you were just little, playing in Ann's office! and every time, it stings, because they remember me as being her little shadow and now she wants nothing to do with me. Is there anything I can do that might make her come around.... or at least understand *why* she never does call? I don't want to forever be sending emails once a year asking her to see me, but I just find myself constantly wanting to. 

**TL;DR : I reached out to my estranged godmother, wanting to catch up and maybe rekindle a relationship. She said she'd be in touch... and never was. A year later, she's still never called, and I'm heartbroken over it and don't know what my next move should be or how to move on.**

771,2alss3,"I knew there were warning signs from the beginning. 

What kept me going was that him and I had the exact belief system. This was important to me, I wanted someone who lived a life similar to mine, not privileged, had to work hard, had changing experiences, but could make sense of it all, and use it to make better decisions.

Growing up, he was always top of his class, to keep up with his fathers demands. He was Valedictorian, a prize won by a male and female, his father was disappointed that my ex did not solely win. He spent his life making academic achievements because his father would instill fear and hurt.

His father always abused him and his mother. One day, he defended his mother and threatened him, roughly when he was 19 years old. His father called the police, his mother took his fathers side, and my ex ended up spending 6 months in jail. His lawyer, paid by my ex's shady uncle, encouraged my ex to plead guilty.

After jail, he got out, went to university, met a girl. They got pregnant, she agreed to keep the baby, but at 6 months, she got cold feet and had an abortion. My ex lived in Toronto, she lived in Montreal, he pleaded and pleaded for her not to do it, but she did. Rightfully so, this crushed him.

He had other experiences with ex's taking advantage of him, family looking down on him. Then I came along. I knew he had issues. I fell in love with him, we talked for hours and hours, our lives mirrored each others, even our health conditions (asthma, poor eye sight, ect), we read each others minds, we were so connected. Time would fly, there was never enough time during the day for us to see each other or talk. We would spend days planning our lives together. Even when I was not actively thinking about plans, or when I was at work, he'd send me link or info on what he knew i'd love. Plans were always catered around me. Our relationship was so simple, we never got bored, never ran out of things to say, never grew tired of seeing each other every day. We would make plans, and get so carried away talking that we would run late. Our thoughts were so connected that we would literally finish each others sentences, oftentimes, I would pick up the phone to call him, and he would already be on the other side.

However, these were the issues, any time he felt I may leave or he may get hurt, he turned into a different person: 

-his ex's dad did not like him; with my dad, he had conflicting views on politicts ect - my dad viewed it has a harmless debate, my ex saw it as I'll take my dad's side. 
- my cousins and I had a good relationship, until I started to aviod them bc of him; my ex's cousins pretty much ignored the violence at home, and I assume my ex feels that family is not genuine or looking out for one's good. As silly as it sounds, I think he might have been worried i may enjoy their company more than his. He did not like it if I enjoyed friends or cousins's company, maybe because he felt that's the beginning of distance. 
- any type of 'girly' attribute (make-up, dresses) he did not like. His ex's wore make-up, and I guess he felt they liked attention from it, and assumed I did it for similar reasons.

Ultimately, his solutions were: 

- Stop talking to my cousins: he felt they did not like him, and I should take his side. Yes, I think if family does not support you for something that makes you happy, then you should distance yourself. My ex and my close cousin did have disagreements, but if my ex came around more often and shown how naturally happy we were, then she and they may have taken more of a liking to him. Was I wrong for not doing this? For not cutting off communication with them? 

- This is nuts: he wanted me to confirm what I had done sexually with my ex's by either e-mailing or messaging them. My ex thought I was lying about my sexual past. 

-Finally, he wanted me to tell my parents my wrong-doings in the relationship: 
- speaking to his best friend at the time during my ex's bday; my ex was running around getting things ready, manning the bar, ect - I went up to him a few times asking when he would spend time with me. I chose to speak to his best friend because it's his best friend and would be harmless - my ex said I should have stopped him and demanded that he spend time with me. 
- I wore a skirt to a party and sat on a counter with my ex beside me, apparently I was showing everyone what was up my skirt - this skirt was about 2 inches above the knee. 
- Instances where he felt I was looking at other men, and a few other small things which I cannot recall at the moment. 

He felt me telling my parents this would make them realize that I was not a 'good girl' I tricked them into believing I was.

The bad parts of our relationship were horrible. Hold a mirror up, and that how equally amazing the good parts were. Was I wrong for not choosing his solutions? I love him deeply and know I will not connect with anyone on a level I did with my ex. I wonder, did I do the right thing my not going by his solutions and ultimately ending our relationship? What if he changes when things in his life get better: finishes school, get a good job, becomes established - him finally feeling life is good, instead of raining on him.

513,2kl8d3,"I've had a lot of stuff to deal with for the better part of a year now.

When I met this girl I had no feelings, but after some time of getting to know her combined with her supporting me when my mother passed back in December, I started to fall for her.

She didn't want that and I really liked her friendship but I feel like I was starting to push too much. I'm not sure if I was struggling with some form of minor depression or something, but I had lost something important, and my priorities weren't in check. She still wanted to be friends then I just needed distance from her to sort some things out.

Cue past this summer I had thought I had sorted things out. Every now and then I would still feel pretty bummed out because part of me still had feelings for her but I put those aside, I valued her friendship a lot more than that.

Just a couple of weeks ago due to schoolwork and other stress I literally broke down and freaked out. I ended up telling her I wasn't sure if she should continue being friends with me (over a text, no less, how great am I?), and talked about how I valued her friendship more than my feelings but I didn't know what to do, how to handle the situation because I felt like I was degrading to how I felt the first time.

First she said she'd give me space to work things out. After I had reached out to her again saying I felt better she said she didn't want to do this back and forth between us. She said she'd be cordial toward me and if I really needed her she'd be around... But the few times I've crossed paths with her since she doesn't even look at me.

I started to realize what I had been doing all of these months. I had wanted to grow up a bit when my mother passed, but I had tethered myself to some past fantasy that was never going to happen. I ended up ruining a good friendship because I couldn't keep my head on straight.

It hurts to think about now, but I've come to accept that I may have permanently screwed this up; I want to set things right and get her friendship back, but I can't afford to make another mistake.

I just don't know if I should try to talk to her again after the dust settles or if it's best to just deal with the fact that I was selfish and stupid and leave her alone for good.

It's only been a couple of weeks since I had essentially ended our friendship, but I feel a lot more at peace with myself right now. I was tired of feeling sorry for myself and feeling worse about myself because I felt my problems weren't that important in retrospect to other things going on.

I still have some stuff to become 100% content with, but if I can patch things up I'm not going to involve her with any of that.

518,243g0s,"So a couple days ago my girlfriend of 3 years left her phone at my apartment. I got kind of curious and ended up going into her texts which resulted in me seeing something that got me kind of scared. Someone was texting her from a number with no contact info trying to arrange for a meeting. My girlfriend seemed apologetic when texting as it seems like there was some trouble arranging for the meet to happen. I wouldnt describe the conversation as flirty but the guy was somewhat affectionate with his choice of words calling her baby and what not. Now, rewind to earlier in the week we didnt have plans but she called me after work just to solidify she was going home early. In their text conversation she texted him after my call to see what was up. Then later in the week we had plans to go hang out with some of her friends upstate for some fair. When I asked through the week about three times who we were meeting she was very illusive about it eventually sharing one or two names as maybes. We ended up not going to the fair and she apologized for not being able to meet him. She said that her friend was going to show her how to use the busses upstate but her friend couldnt make it. So I'm not sure if I was her friend or not in that conversation. She proceeded to try and make new plans with him but it didnt seem to go anywhere. 

Heres where it gets a bit tricky. My paranoia only grew and although I am deeply ashamed to some degree to say it I went into her email. Her email was Auto-login and it was one she never told me about. When I went inside I saw a few emails between her and a certain username. There was no flirtation, nothing too friendly about them, very short to the point and direct. He was saying that he missed her and has been thinking about her and wanted to see her. She responded that she couldnt talk but was free during the period that was the night she called me to say she was staying in, and the next day of the fair. He simply asked where they were meeting and when.

I found out the first name of this person via one of the emails so I ran a facebook search for him through my girlfriend. I came up with one person who had the same name with an extra letter who lived in the same area as where she was supposedly going to meet this guy so I wonder if it could be the same guy. 

I've been friends with this girl for a number of years before we started dating and I've always treated her well but Im definitely not a pushover or anything. It's extremely difficult for me to imagine her cheating because I cant think of any serious issues that have come into our relationship within the past year or so. As far as I know/understand its been really steady in a great way. That being said I know as humans its not impossible for someone to cheat and I have no idea what to do. It just confuses me because my girlfriend has extreme anxiety when it comes to trips alone and I dont know why she would even entertain this idea unless there was something in return coming through.

I'm afraid that If I bring it up and explain what happened I will be the one bringing a new problem to the table. What should I do reddit? What is the best course of action? Should I come clean and tell her what I did and hope she can explain? I'm not easy to win over so I could tell if she's bullshitting me. Should I wait till a future date and check the stuff more for additional evidence then take action? Should I shrug it off as nothing? I'm honestly lost, help me Reddit you are my only hope.

I got the birth control implant a year ago which turned me into a totally different person, moody all the time and never felt like being intimate. That took a toll on us, but I got it taken out recently, things improved but we're still not back to normal. On top of that we've been moving so that put a little strain on us as well. We've never been great at communicating so any time we have a problem we get pissy then a day later it's like it never happened.

I want to work on everything, he's my best friend and I can't stand the thought of not being with him.

He comes out to most of his friends and family while we were together, we broke up due to some issues. Pretty mutual and 6-7 months down the line (now) he's uncertain as to whether he wants to meet up with me.

He told me that he would meet up with me on the condition that I didn't say anything about the relationship we had or make any references to our past. I responded by saying that this would be near impossible in my eyes, due to how I've known him. Our memories would have to be wiped and we'd need to be strangers again. I said that I wouldn't mention anything about the relationship but I'm also not going to pretend like nothing happened either.

He tells me that he's completely over the relationship, but I'm still confused as to why he feels fearful/uncomfortable over meeting up even if we do talk about the past. Surely if you were over something, it no longer makes you uncomfortable talking about it? In regard to this, he also reminded me that he was the one who ended it, not that it's relevant to moving on (so I replied).

He said I was cold for saying that I no longer felt sad over our relationship but nostalgic. I then explained why I felt how I felt; things didn't work out between us, it would therefore not have worked in the long run. It is how it is, you've just got to accept it. And how I take away all the good times/memories from the relationship.

Additionally, just some background on him. When his dog passed away, he bought a new one the next day. And he tells me he gets upset and cries over his grandad's memories. He's also dating a girl since August this year and aggressively claimed to me that he's no longer bi, when I asked him to tell his girlfriend about the meet up if he felt necessary. Note, previously when we were together he told me that he believed sexuality is given from birth.

162,1sw649,"I'm married 5 years, been with my wife for 10 years, we have a 2 year old together.

Things have been rocky lately and we have been in marriage counseling, but overall I love my wife very much and am committed to my relationship.

I've recently developed an infatuation/crush with a female coworker. It's mutual, but we are both married and neither one of us rationally has any interest in pursuing anything. Luckily, we work in different offices so we don't see each other that often - although we do work together occasionally.

This is a 2 prong issue - 

1) I want to just get over my feelings and move on, but it's difficult. I'm sure you all know the feeling you get when you first get in to somebody else; it's hard to think of anything else, you idealize them in a completely unrealistic way, think they are amazing, etc. It's completely irrational but the feelings are there and they can be difficult to deal with, especially when I'm around my wife and just want to be happy with her.

2) Is there any hope of ever getting this feeling back with my wife? Honestly it hasn't been there since we first started dating, which I think is pretty normal... but feeling like this about somebody else (and feeling like they feel the same way) has just made me kind of sad that I don't feel that way with my wife. It's a great feeling to have. My wife and I have a mature, long term love, but that feeling of excitement and almost obsession with another person feels great. I would love to feel that way about my wife again, but I feel like that probably won't ever happen again and that makes me kind of sad. Any hope or advice here?

Just some notes:

1 - I'm smart enough and in control enough that nothing is going to happen as far as infidelity or truly screwing things up with my wife. I'm sure my crush feels the same way.

2 - The reasons for the infatuation I think stem from admiration for each other. I think we both feel like the other is very impressive in relation to the work place. This goes to #2 above - I feel like my wife and I are missing this. I was initially attracted to her because I felt like she was very smart and impressive, and I think she felt a similar way towards me. But I think that's missing lately. 

How do we learn to truly appreciate each other again? I think that's what I feel like I'm missing and feel sad about - my crush thinks I'm amazing, my wife has many more negative views of me, and vice versa.

We are in marriage counselling already, so it may be that this is something I just need to address with my therapist, but at the moment I feel just consumed with this feeling and I want it to **go away** ... so any advice appreciated. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Thanks.

About a month and a half ago she received news that she had received a  clinical internship out of town that she was super excited about, she wants to be a doctor. So as we were discussing this she  starts to  tell me how she cant be fair to me in the relationship and that I put in so much work and she cannot hope to reciprocate the work. I tell her this is fine I understand that this dream that you have had is super important  to you and I back you up fully.

So to understand something about my girlfriend, Channelle, she has projects going on all the time as of right now she has  this clerical internship, she has a research project required for it, she has to teach a class for it, she is studying for her MCAT, she is living in a new city, she has me, and she is  stressed out about  things back here in our town such as a premed club she runs, she works for a professor doing research, she has a normal job, and not to mention upcoming classes. In other words she is super stressed out.

Well a few weeks ago she managed to come home for a  long weekend and we got into a discussion when I asked her  how things were going. She was super excited about the internship, she absolutely loves it the only thing is she is insanely stressed she works 14 hour days at the clinic and has  to  study for her MCAT. She then proceeds to tell me that she has started to lose feelings for me ever since we moved in together  about 3 and a half months ago and that she thought at first that it was just premove in jitters, after quite a long  time of talking and many tears she manages to tell me that we can wait until after she  finishes her  internship and then we can  try and work things out.

Well yesterday was hard for me, I recently broke my hand at work and can no longer work which means  long days of sitting around doing absolutely nothing at the house, Im super depressed and sad and hadnt heard from her in two days. I  send her  a long text explaining that I miss her  and love her and   would really appreciate just getting a text saying hey miss you every day or something along the lines of that because it would mean the world to me.
It doesn't go over well she tells me that she is working  14 hour days she inst near her  phone half the day it will be 10 times worse over the next few years as she tries to become a doctor and if I'm unhappy that maybe we shouldn't be together. She  tells me that maybe I dont think about what she needs and to be honest she never tells me Im there 100 percent to support her. 

Later that night I text her and apologize for bringing this up I know she is super busy and super stressed out and that I love her and she proceeds to say that she she doesnt think it is appropriate for her to say it back.
I dont know what to do she will be gone for another 3 weeks and in that time who knows if I will still have my girlfriend or not.

645,2kdrhg,"My husband and I have been together for 10 years; married for 7; we have a 5 year old daughter.

He has always wanted a big family and we agreed we would have at least one more child. He has been pushing me for years and since I turned 35 he is getting pushier.

The truth is the reason I have been reluctant is that I feel like we are more roommates than spouses. We still have sex, we go on dates, but I don't really feel any spark or romance toward him. I feel like I've been going through the motions, trying to fake it 'til I make it to get the love feelings back into our marriage. I've been feeling this way for years and nothing has changed.

I like spending time with my husband. I love our family, and nothing makes me happier than the three of us spending the day together. I would do anything to ensure my daughter has a good, happy life.

I'm not unhappy in my marriage by a long shot. We are great at working together, problem-solving, communicating, all that stuff. 

I just don't feel like I'm in love any more.

Is that a good enough reason to break up my family and get divorced? Or should I just accept that this is the life I constructed for myself and count my blessings for the many good things I do have going for me in my marriage? It could be a lot worse than having a supportive, thoughtful, loving, stable partner. And when I think about how much it would turn everyone's lives upside down if we divorced, that sounds like a much worse version of our lives. We would go from financially comfortable and able to afford extras and vacations to really, really struggling (I make more than my husband and have more assets so it would be harder financially on him). We would both lose out on so much of our daughter's life. And even though my husband is more of a friend than a lover, I would feel like I was losing my best friend of a decade. I would probably never have another child. There are so many downsides to divorce. Should I just stick it out and enjoy my life for what it is, even if it's missing that romantic spark?

366,2fr740,"Three months ago my boyfriend moved away for work. I did not originally want to have a long distance relationship, knowing how they usually end up, but we had been together for over three years and he practically begged me to give it a chance. I loved him, so I agreed. We met in highschool when I was 16 and he was 17 so we have been through a lot together already. I even flew out to see him a few weeks ago. 

However, things got rough. The relationship began ideally; he was a gentleman, he treated me so well, etc. Lately, over the past five months, I have been the one trying to make things work. Things were relatively okay, but I felt like I was the only one trying despite him telling me how much he loved me and how it would be okay. 

Fast forward to now, and he has put little to no effort into the relationship at all anymore. Be it phone calls, texting, or giving him all the support I know he needed, I received nothing in return except him acknowledging that while still in love with me, he is confused and doesn't think he can do this anymore.  Knowing that I deserved better, I ended it, but it's difficult because he is my first everything and I still love him, but I know I need time to find myself and what I want.

975,1o5crf,"i'll try to keep this short. my best friend over the last 10 years has taken a turn for the worse.

he went from being a normal friend, to now every time i'm around him he is yelling, out in public, yelling all loud. drives by other cars YO!.. YO!... what song is that? he starts conversations with random people trying to be all open and free spirited, but the look on 99% of other peoples faces is fear and confusion. 

he is a large not so clean looking man (think scum bag steve meme) and I don't mind loud life of the party type people if that is who they want to be, but he just makes everyone feel awkward, and when i'm with him, i feel people look at me and judge me for being his friend.

It all sounds stupid to me as I type this, but he has been my friend for ever, his constant yelling and jersey shore impressions (literally does actual impressions here and he loves the show) and his trolling of other people is all like dealing with a child. 

I usually ignore it, walk away (unless i'm stuck in his car with him) and stuff like that, but when i'm forced to be around him cause we made plans or are doing work (we work together too) it becomes very energy draining.

The last and final part that has me writing this, he has started to make a lot of gay jokes. First few months i just kinda laughed it off, some guys make gay type jokes with their guy friends, that has never been me, but i'm not about to make someone feel awkward for the way they try to joke around. But his jokes aren't even funny, they are just creepy and weird now, sending me text messages saying he wants to be inside of me... and i can reply with stop being gay with me man or something that is honest so he can tell i'm not joking, to which he just carries on his texts more so i ignore him.

I basically am looking for a way to tell him to shut up nicely. i'm very good at saying shit in a mean way, and i really feel like cutting him out of my life forever may be the only option, but maybe someone here has dealt with immature friends like this before. 

I also believe he is doing this cause he is a very insecure person, he isn't happy he is over weight, and after a lot of talks about that stuff with him, it was after then a few months that he started talking about how if he thinks better of him self others will too... then this was the result.

502,2dy4be,"TL;DR; Fiance of 4 and half years, back into her gambling habit. Need advice on letting her go and not be so hurt by this.

I'm 29, she's 40. (Yes, I know, big age difference. But I love her too much and didn't think or see the age difference)We’ve been together 4 and half years. She's had a gambling problem prior to us hooking up, has went back to it several times. We moved far from friends and family to start new and to leave her past trouble behind. For the longest time I have been thinking of her marrying her, but held off because I had a feeling she might get back to it again. Have tried getting her into hobbies, other activities, but her stubbornness coupled with lack of wanting to even try has not helped the situation. She works retail part-time and I have my full-time career I am focusing on, but with her going back into her hobby again is making things way too hard to deal with. Our rent lease is up October and I cannot stand to see her slowly deteriorating while we are still together. I want to tell her that either she keeps herself off until we have to move our separate ways or move out by the end of month if she can’t control herself. 

The suckiest part to all this is that I have too much feelings for her and get to deal with it all, while she keeps herself busy with her gambling addiction. I know I need to man up and just let it go. I got myself into this and need to get myself out, but need advice on best way to deal with this. I pretty much can't sleep without her next to me and that's another part that's going to keep me up tonight. Seriously feel broken right now.

612,2wdiia,"My boyfriend (I'll call him Carter here) are in our second semester of college together, at the same school. Though we're now on our university campus, we got together in our first semester which we both spent studying abroad in a small group with several other students from our university. Though I'm normally a social, fun-loving people person with a solid group of friends, I found myself extremely lonely through this trip and at odds with several of the group members for a variety of reasons. After getting together, I spent probably 80% of my free time with Carter; I was completely reliant on him for social interaction. It was a situation that was extremely foreign to me, and though it was lovely to have a companion, the experience of the semester as a whole was generally a very trying time for me. 

Basically, I'm in desperate need of advice as to whether or not my expectations or concerns are unfounded. I've had several boyfriends in the past and from what I've been told, I'm generally considered an attractive, outgoing person. Though Carter is an extremely handsome, athletic, and smart young man, I'm his first real girlfriend, mostly due to the time commitments he had to athletics and academics in high school. We had some trust issues at the start of our relationship (before we had agreed to be exclusive), but have since resolved those. Our issues now stem from a place that seems to be inherent in both our characters and I'm incredibly unsure of how to resolve them. I've been trying so hard to work them out with Carter and talk them out with close friends, but I'm so, so lost, and very afraid of a breakup. We both lost our virginities to one another, and our school is a small one-- we'd see each other all the time, and though I now have a wonderful group of friends, Carter and I still spend 4/7 evenings together, just hanging out. Since I'm so recently in a new setting, I don't want to be really stressed out with a break up and scare off my new friends. I know it's unfair, but it would so devastate me to see him with someone else.


Essentially, our issues boil down to a few main topics.


1. Carter has been questioning his sexuality since high school. He really disliked his school, as it was all-male and very conservative, and often found himself extremely overworked and unhappy. He's told me that he has had strong feelings for two boys before; I'm the only person he's ever told. Though he's liberal (as am I), he's extremely uncomfortable with this part of himself. Publicly, he identifies as completely heterosexual, but privately (to me) he identifies himself as bisexual, MAYBE. I've done my best to be extremely supportive of this. I've encouraged him to talk to a therapist and that though he shouldn't feel pressure to come out until he's ready, this part of him is one that is normal, natural, and in no way makes him a bad person. He refuses to seek help with something that clearly bothers him. In the middle of our relationship, he spent some time with the boy he had previously had feelings for and told me that those feelings still lingered. I was really, really hurt, but I did my best to be supportive and he's since said that he's totally moved on. My issue is that there is a significant part of me that can't help but believe in the back of my mind that he's gay and in denial. He refuses to go down on me, expressing disgust at the idea, and very noticeably wipes his fingers off whenever he fingers me-- even if it's just before we have sex. It's slowly lead to me feeling really bad about my body and about my lady bits. He attempted oral once, for about a half-second, before deciding that the taste was disgusting, and the hair unbearable. I do shave as completely as I can, but it can be difficult to access some parts without cutting myself accidentally and causing myself a lot of pain. I don't want to pressure him into anything that makes him uncomfortable, but I really, really miss oral sex, and though I want it from him, it's such a turn off knowing that he so clearly feels somewhat repulsed by my body at times. On top of all that, I'm 5'5 and approximately 110 pounds, in pretty good shape; nonetheless, I sometimes feel like he thinks I have too much putty on my belly, and it makes me feel really bad about myself.


2. I'm a very romantic person, and Carter is not. I understand that this is a fundamental difference between us, but it often feels like he's unwilling to put the effort in to make me happy with some small-scale things. I know it might sound silly, but he can't even name three reasons he loves me. To me, that feels as though the reason that he loves me (or believes he does) is because I'm the first person to really show interest in him. It makes me feel as though it could've been any girl, as long as she initiated flirting and expressed interest in his problems. I sometimes feel so un-special around him, just because he seems so indifferent to/uninterested in what makes me an individual. He often ignores me, when I speak to him directly, usually when he's sitting on his computer. I can understand that sometimes laptops can distract us, but it happens so, so often, and really upsets me. I've addressed this many times, and though he apologizes and claims it's a bad habit that he doesn't fully understand, it feels as though it happens really consistently. I'm a fairly anxious person, and sometimes when I tell him that I'm worried about something or upset or angry about something (usually something that happened during my day), he'll just act as if I hadn't even spoken at all. This only serves to escalate my anxiety, because I worry that he's behaving in a way that my friends and peers wish they could when I speak, but are too polite to.


3. Carter knows that holidays and anniversaries are important to me. I know that they're silly and a bit trite, but I'm not expecting a gift that would require real money; I just want acknowledgment that he cares about something that I care about. For example, I bought him a vinyl album ($19.99) for his collection for Christmas that I put a lot of though into picking out especially for him-- he gave me an old sweater that he knew I liked (and that he has a second version of anyways), unwrapped-- he just handed it to me when I got into his car. I was under no expectation for a gift of anything before our 6-month, but though I reminded him several times that it was coming up, all I got was a mini Kraft mac-n'-cheese left on my desk.

Reddit, am I being unreasonable? Sometimes I feel so unhappy and like he so doesn't value me as a person or as a partner. I've tried talking to him about these things probably four or five times and ultimately, they don't change and he just bursts into tears. We've had lots of great times together, and I know he loves me, but sometimes I don't want to be with him because I'm so scared of the negative repercussions of a breakup. I know that other guys here at school find me attractive, but really, I'm a relationship person, and I've found in the past that when I'm single, my life gets really, really messy.
   
**TL;DR: Sometimes I really don't like how my relationship with my boyfriend of 6 mos. makes me feel, but I don't know whether or not I want to throw away the relationship with the person I lost my virginity to because I'm too sensitive.**

**EDIT** We're not a miserable couple. We're generally pretty supportive of one another-- he holds me when I'm sad, he's eager to see me every day and visits my dorm room every morning to give me a kiss before class. I'm honestly just a young, very confused college freshman looking for advice as to whether or not I'm wasting my youth right now.
