In high school, I dated this guy, who we will call John.  I only dated him for about six months but it didn't go well as John has, I'm fairly certain, undiagnosed Asperger's as well as a plethora of other social anxiety issues.  I ended the relationship abruptly when he blew up at me one day (I don't even remember what the argument was about) and started screaming and threw a chair at me.  We were not physically intimate at all except for kissing one time, at which point he told me his mother would not approve of my behavior.  These reasons led to me breaking it off.

I remained friends with him in college (since he ran in our circle of friends) for the first two years but quickly realized that this guy was not only emotionally damaged, but that he was weighing me down.  I stopped hanging out with him altogether and found new friends and moved on with my life, and figured that was the end of it.  I then met my future husband, and we are extremely happy together.

However, not too long after we finished the bachelor's portion of college, I found out that this ex had been spreading lies about me to all his guy friends saying that I was Psychotic and that the only reason I left to pursue my Master's (out of state) was so that I could Forget the heartbreak and that HE was the one who broke everything off with me.  Keep in mind that this is four years since high school, and we dated in junior year.

He also told several members of our old group of friends that my boyfriend (now husband) was just an attempt to get over my ex and that I was so in love with him that I would never move on, and that that was the only reason I went out of state, was just to get him out of my mind.  The few asshole friends he has have treated me like shit in person on the rare occasions I've run into them in town and one of them even had the guff to call me a Whore for no apparent reason; luckily none of them matter and I really just view them as a bunch of uneducated bros.

Normally I wouldn't give much of a shit but it really irked me that he told OUR group of friends this as well.  None of them seem to take him seriously but it still aggravates me that he feels the need to do this.  So, I sent him a brief e-mail basically stating, You need to stop doing this.  If you don't stop doing this, you and I will have to talk face-to-face about your behavior, and I don't feel like driving four hours to talk to someone about a relationship that hasn't existed for five years.  Please treat me with respect as I feel that I was your friend long enough that I deserve some.  He never replied, and for a long time, I didn't hear any other rumors, so I thought it was over.

Now here I am, eleven years since that relationship, and I've started hearing these stupid rumors again from the same friends!  This guy is claiming that I'm Looking to get back together with him at the high school reunion????  At this point my husband and I have been married for three years (together for seven), so I think everyone else believes this dude has lost it.  However, I am sick of this guy not moving on and I don't want to keep dealing with this.  How much longer must he continue to make this shit up?  Fifteen years?  Twenty?  Thirty?

Personally, I think (and my husband agrees) he leads a very sad life and that he is undiagnosed for a lot of social problems; he was always an extremely book-smart person but extremely dumb when it came to people, one of the main reasons I got tired of hanging out with him (really I just got tired of constantly feeling like I was babysitting him).  I think maybe he is doing this because, as far as I know, he has dated literally no one else and doesn't have much else to do/think about besides school and his lack of a social life.  I think he is unable to let go of the past.

Normally I would just skip the reunion as I really don't care about high school, but there are a few friends who live out of state that are coming to this, and I would love to see them as it's been years since I have.  I also don't think it's right that I should have to avoid the reunion just because of ONE ignoramus...and I also don't think it's right that he's getting away with making shit up about me.

my ex and i recently got back together, after almost 2 months of separation. we were having some communication issues before, but when we got back together we agreed that when we have issues, we would talk it over do it wouldn't get out of hand.

the day that we got back together, she was supposed to have drinks with her friends from work. so after i dropped her off, she said she was gonna text/msg me when she got home.

but i never got that text. 

i was still awake at around 2am when i noticed that she has not texted me if she got home (or not). i was worried what has happened to her so i keep calling her phone till 6am. after making the last try at 6:30am (with still no answer), i gave up and just went to bed, hoping that she is safe, and maybe she'll contact me later.

at around noon, she texted me, told me about what happened. here are the main points from her text:

she said she got home around 2am. she left her expensive phone (which she loves, and i dont see just letting anyone borrow it) to her friend, cause her friend has to text someone. her sister borrowed the tablet and the laptop so she had no way of messaging me in facebook. when i kept calling her phone till the early morning, her friends wanted to text me, but claimed that her pre-paid sim ran out of credits, so they were not able to text me.

Now, i'm the sort of person who would like to hear the whole story before concluding if I believe it or not. 

The story sounds kinda fishy or too coincidental to me. I mean i have a lot of questions in my mind that i feel the need to be cleared up. I asked her if we can talk about it, but she got annoyed and said telling me the story once is enough , and its up to me if i believe her or not. i texted her that i'm not mad, and i just want to talk about it, like what we've agreed to when we got back together. but she just ignored me, and has been giving me the silent treatment .

please bare with me on this, I'm writing from my phone on the beach on holiday. My gf 22, me male 21. I've noticed for a while now my girlfriend hasn't been wanting sex, and just recently the amount she kissed me etc has declined, yesterday while we are on holiday I decided it felt right to make a move on her and started slowly kissing her, then she started to burst out in tears. So i decided its enough and I need to know what's wrong, eventually I get it out of her that she is not happy in the relationship, she continues, the worst thing is I have done nothing wrong I am perfect, but she feels pressured because I put in so much effort for her and she feels like she can't reciprocate that. And so yesterday we ended the relationship and are finishing the holiday as friends but I don't understand why this is the case, I never expect anything of her except for the affection you would expect from any relation ship, to me its like she won the lottery and is just setting fire to the earnings.

I suppose I have wasted a lot of time in the past few years of my life. I spent a fair amount of time locked up in my mind, simply too afraid to unleash the true potential of life. Depression seems something more real when you experience it. It seems as if it were something more than just a nine letter word written on a piece of paper when you are truly brought to your knees begging for a break of lament.


There are so many regrets I hold to my name that I wish I didn’t have to regret. I didn’t go so far as to attempt to take my own life or anything of the sort, but I did in fact have my fair share of impulsive, irrational thoughts that I almost decided to go with for whatever the reason. I was never exactly the smartest person, but I wasn’t the dumbest either, which kind of scared me.


I can't count the number of times I had wished I could gain the courage to end it all. To end all the pain and suffering I had to endure in the remaining semester of grade 12 up to a couple months ago... but I never once acted upon it. But I felt it. It was like a growing entity inside of me, only to be awakened at random intervals for no relevent reason. It triggered something inside of me when it fully awoke. Something different. Something that wasn’t like me. Something that made me... not me.


I was more aggressive towards people I knew, as well as the ones I didn’t know, I was always tired, so very ridden with fatigue. I didn’t have anything to look forward to in my life except for that blank term everyone calls the “future.” Everything just seemed like a downward spiral for me that never seemed to end. I could numb the pain by listening to music that calmed my mind, but it would never permanently go away. It was like a quick fix for a junkie’s drug obsession. It was like a relapse, it never truly fixed anything. When I seemed to be having fun, it was ruined because I knew it would be coming back and I dreaded it.


On top of all of this, I met a girl named Melanie. now Melanie... it’s a rather complicated story, but probably one of the most important ones in my life. I’ve never met a girl so beautifully unique, intelligent, funny, gorgeous, cute, or... well, you get the idea, I could go on for awhile.


I first met her through a text randomly when I was dating my Ex. I started to really develop feelings for her when my two year relationship slowly started crumbling. I decided things wouldn’t work out between us and ended it completely, I was sick of the emotional abuse and needed a way out. I was shifting focus to Melanie subconsciously.


I ended up becoming really depressed for three months after my relationship ended and started failing classes, cutting contact with friends, having suicidal thoughts... all that kept me going was music. Making music and listening to music. Nine Inch Nails has the most incredible lyrics that are all relatable, as the man behind NIN, Trent Reznor, has gone through it all before. Depression, suicidal attempts, substance abuse, loss of people. It really did help me a lot.


We ended up hanging out for the first time a couple months after the fact of expressing feelings for each other. Only I waited too long, she began to date her ex again. This is where it gets complicated. When we hung out, I felt something unlike anything I had ever felt before. I felt like myself again, it was as if she was a first responder pulling me out of the rubble of depression. She saved me. If it wasn’t for her, I’m afraid I might not have been here today. A bit dramatic, I know, but who’s to say what’s dramatic when you feel like everything is nothing? The smallest bit of joy feels like a cliche movie scene.


It was winter and we were walking around her neighborhood. Now I hate the term “hot,” but by all means she really was. I prefer beautiful, the term applies to her a lot more than “hot” would. We ended up awkwardly cuddling, (probably my fault for the awkwardness,) and then for some reason tried to kiss her. Worst mistake of my life. It wasn’t like me. Maybe I got carried away with the feeling of being happy for the first time in months, but by all means it still wasn’t right. I was not that person, and it made me hate myself even more than I had begun to.


We didn’t hang out for awhile after that, but we grew closer and closer as the days grew by. My feelings continually grew from interest to lust to love. Little did I know, a year knowing this girl, and I was already ready to give up everything I had just for a chance with her. My ex had tried to get back together with me, I tried, but I just couldn’t do it. I ended up breaking it off in pursuit of Melanie again.


This is the most complicated part that is still in effect today... Melanie admitted feelings for me as well, but she’s still conflicted with her ex. Normally, any guy would say “fuck this, I’m out of here,” but I just can’t. I’ve tried so many times, but I always end up regretting it, even after cutting contact down to a minimal, getting rid of pictures sent to me, and things like that. I know it’s not right to be used like this even if she doesn’t mean to, but it hurts just as much being away from her as it does being with her. She’s a part of my life now, I can’t just give it up, especially when for awhile in my depression she’s the only thing that I focused on…

Melanie will say she loves me... in which I will return the favor by saying I love her too. I express my feelings for her because I want her to know... but sometimes I stop, sometimes I act weird. Why? Because whenever we plan to hangout, plans almost never fall through. The excuse is usually her mom, which I can believe, but I don’t know. It’s always me who makes the effort to arrange plans, even if they don’t work out. That, and I’m always discouraged by her ex and her tendencies to return back to him.


I don’t hate people because I’m not that type of person. But her ex... I’ll just say he’s something else. He’s not too intelligent from what I can tell, but that’s okay, it’s not like I know him personally. I’ll just say he’s not too intelligent in his texts and judgement. He basically hates me because he’s jealous of me, and he she’ll show me texts he’ll send to her about me just bashing me in any way he can, but it’s not like I really care, I’m not one for high school drama. I hate the way he uses her and she doesn’t see... like how he can never be alone, and he’ll always find someone else if he’s not with her, but make up excuses about it and how he didn’t mean for it to happen. Then she’ll cave in and fall back into place with him. Rinse, wash, and repeat. Now THAT straight up pisses me off how someone could use her like that. She’s not a toy. Don’t fucking treat her that way. Don’t pick her up and drop her. You want to treat her better than I can? Then good, fucking do it, because she deserves the best of the best, regardless of who it’s with.


That just brings me to the point of who I am. Yeah, I’m me, but who is me? What is so special about me? Yeah, we’re our own worst critics, but I can honestly say I’m not the best of the best. First of all, my temper. I’ve got a horrible temper especially when things don’t go my way. I’m selfish. I’m over emotional. I’m not the ideal weight, I don’t really have muscles, I bite my nails way more than I should, I play video games too much, I get carried away with producing my music, I can be overly annoying... you get the point now, I’m depressing myself further. What I mean to say is, if I was someone else, would things work out better? What if I made it in my music, or writing? I’m desperate for an answer…


I just wish there was some way for Melanie to just at least give me a shot if she really loves me like we’ve proven in the past year, or just be done with me for good and realize her ex is just using her. I don’t get how if you have such strong feelings for someone that you make them wait a year. If someone waited a year on me non-stop like this... I’d definitely give them a chance if I had feelings for them too. That’s why I’m so confused. Every time she mentions him, my heart just drops. It’s like I’ve lost already. They go to the same school. He has the advantage there, also given that they have already dated so she’s still emotionally tied to him because she’s too scared to cut the ties. I just don’t understand. All I want is to be with her, but she’s always saying she’s stuck between us both. And I hate it.


I can’t go to sleep without thinking about her. I dream about her. I think about her all the time. Her random pictures make me smile some of the biggest smiles I’ve had. Her “I love you’s” make every day worth living. I don’t know what I’d do without her. I sometimes think about what it’d be like if we were together, I can’t even think of a negative except for perhaps the amount of time we’d get to see each other, but I’m sure it’ll change. I’ve found who I truly want to be with and I’m determined to make it work somehow... I just don’t know how yet. I know the first obstacle is the whole “Love triangle” situation, but I’m sure it will fade with time... if you really love me, that would be the way to show it... if you don’t make a decision, then you’ll lose both. I’m afraid the way it’s going now with everything in my life, you may have already lost one…
I
’m so sick of being stuck here waiting for happiness to finally arrive. I understand where she’s coming from, but I think a decision needs to be made. I can’t sit around another year waiting for her, even if she is everything I’d ever and do want. All I want is for her to be happy whether it’s with me or not, I just wish she’d realize and make up her mind about what exactly it is that makes her happy.


I just hung out with her again today, a couple months after the last time we hungout. We still talk daily via text messaging and Facetime. All in all, it was great. We were laughing the whole time, and I started to feel happy again. It was cold, so we hugged a couple of times, but nothing other than that happened. I’m not stuck sitting here again in my depression wondering what to do. I never feel happy anymore unless I’m talking to her, or I’m with her, and it’s starting to scare me. I don’t know what to do.


There’s a lot more I could write on this situation but I just can’t anymore. It’s too emotionally draining. I guess I summarized it all up already. What should I do? Should I stay and wait it out for her to organize her thoughts and get over her ex? It’s already been a year, now, of them dating on and off once or twice. She’s now single for 4 months but he’s controlling and insists they’re still faithful to each other even apart. Should I just give her the option of choosing one of the other or leaving? I don’t even know what I’d do if I ended up losing someone who’s a bestfriend and so much more that I rely on so heavily…


I’m sorry this was so long. Writing this out kind of helped me I guess. I guess it’s kind of an attention whore move, I just want to feel like somebody will listen to my situation…

About two years ago she started dating a guy named Dewey. It was kind of awkward when I first met him, but I figured that was normal. Except every time we hung out after that (usually in a group of 4-6) he was always really quiet and cold.

I learned from other people in our group that he only does this when I'm there. Apparently he acts completely different in most situations. So I tried to make an extra effort to be friendly to him. I'd try to bring him into conversations. He mentioned he was lactose intolerant, so I gave him some of the supplements that I had. These encounters were always met with a total cold shoulder. He had been over to my house a few times and even my parents said they thought he was rude (he wouldn't say ""hi"" to anyone, he didn't engage in conversations, and he always refused food). I spent several months trying to get on good terms with this guy. I even sent him a facebook message basically saying ""what's up?"" and he didn't reply. I found out from Gale that Dewey's previous girlfriend cheated on him with her ex, so now he's suspicious of me. She's tried talking to him about it, and apparently he dodges the subject or says he just doesn't like my personality.

It really hurt my feelings that there was seemingly nothing I could do about this. I talked to my friends and said that I didn't want to hang out with someone who categorically dislikes me. I think he's kind of an asshole. So what really sucks now is that I get uninvited to stuff. Like, ""Come on over to this party, oh wait, Dewey is still here with Gale.""

At this point, I don't even care that this guy doesn't like me, I just can't believe that some of my friends do this me. I feel like I put in a lot of effort to make this right, and he was unreasonable. But they still hang out with him, and I sometimes get uninvited to things. This whole thing is so stupid.

I want to be happy with myself and love myself again but I don't see it happening.  I know this is a general question but this is so new to me and I feel like everyone went through this years ago.  This is my first broken heart, my first breakup... How do I survive this? Any tips?

Me and my boyfriend of 8 months have had our ups and downs in the relationship. Whenever we argue about something I'm always the one who ends up in tears. He's said things to me that have been so hurtful all I could do is cry and even still I'm always the one to apologize. He stays about an hour and a half away so we don't get to see each other much. One day we were supposed to hang out and he tells me he can't come because he is sick. I was sad and disappointed and he was acting like he didn't care at all. After I calmed down some I asked him if he was okay and how was he feeling and he just told me to leave him alone. This was a complete breaking point for me and I flipped out. I told him how fucked up it was that here I am trying to ask how's he is doing And he basically is saying Fuck you to me by blowing me off like that. I had been having the worst day of my life and what he did on top of that was like a slap in the face to me. I told him how hurt I was. I emphasized how he will never understand how much he really really hurt me and he still acted like he didn't care. The next day I ended up the one apologizing for blowing up at him because I know he would never apologize. I was still so hurt but I just tried to let it go. Not even an hour ago I was talking to him and asked if he wanted to hang out on new years eve and he told me he didn't have any money to get here. All I said was I was sad that we never got to see each other and he blew up at me saying I constantly complain that we never get to see each other and all I think about is how hard it is for me and not him and that I'm not understanding. And again, I'm the one apologizing saying that I appreciate everything he does and I'm sorry that I don't show it enough. Now he's not talking to me. I feel like everything I try to do back fires with him. I tell him all the time that I would do anything for him and praise him all the time.

31799,Infidelity,2stq6x,"Edit: shitty title, sorry. It should read more like I think she is considering cheating on me. I don't think she has yet. 

I've been dating this girl since August,we'll call her Heather. It's not overly serious, but it's been slowly getting that way. We are monogamous with each other at this stage so we don't have to use condoms. I say that because in the beginning we were still hooking up with others and that was fine on both sides. 

Anyway, so last week I went to her banquet for finishing grad school and met her parents for the first time... Hence why I said slowly getting more serious. The evening went well and at midnight after her parents were gone her and her girlfriends wanted to go out (a bunch of them are single and very liberal when it comes to finding one night stands, and I know Heather is the same way. I'm not saying this to cast a negative light, because I think if it's socially acceptable for guys to do it, why not girls?) so anyway, her friends wanted to find guys for the night. I worked all day out of town and drove in for the banquet and had to be back at work the next day so I told Heather I was calling it and I would just go sleep at her apartment. At the time that I left she was a bit tipsy. Not drunk, but feeling it for sure. 

1:45am rolls around and she calls so I can buzz her into the apartment. She's absolutely hammered. We get to bed and she wants to have sex. Lights are out and it's pitch black. She's really quiet the first 10 minutes which was odd, but we usually don't have drunk sex so I thought nothing of it. Then she gets into it more and keeps calling me babe and enjoying it... Which is a little out of the ordinary because she usually says my name. Whatever, minor details right? 

So we finish up and we're kissing and grinding and she mumbles, 'okay take me home. I respond confused, she just starts kissing me again so I think whatever she' s drunk. We start having sex for a few more minutes and then stop. She says she has to go pee.  She sits up on the side of the bed. Pauses for a moment, and says drunkenly where's the bathroom?. I just laugh in response thinking she's joking. 30 seconds goes by and she says she has to pee and asks where the bathroom is again (in very drunken speech). 

I say, Heather. Do you know where you are right now?... 

No response 

So I ask the question that popped into my head when she was all disoriented... Heather, who am I? 

She looks at me in the dark... No response. 

I wait a good minute in silence and ask her again very clearly. No response. Then a couple more minutes and ask again... Still nothing. So as best I can tell she has no idea who she just had sex with. 

I don't press the issue since she's drunk. I told her my name and said she's in her own apartment and safe (I probably could have justified getting all mad, but where js that going to get you with a drunk girl who doesn't even know where she is?) She starts crying right away and then stop after a minute. Goes to the washroom and that was that. I left for work while she was still sleeping. 

Should I just chalk this up as a drunk night and move on? She's been cheated on in the past so I like to think she wouldn't, but who knows. Or am I just being oblivious to an obvious situation? 

Thanks.

Edit: Update already. We just talked and she admitted to still have sex with others up until a month and a half ago because we didn't have a title officially... I guess she just thought she went home with someone else.

We've also started to talk a lot more often, (it's become most nights as of late) on Facebook. This has started late last year, when we started to talk more.

She's admittedly a shyish person, however she's the most open with me than any others in our friendship group. In a friend group predominantly made up of males, she says to people that every male in the group is like a sibling. We seem to have a lot in common and over the years of knowing her I've grown to like her, a lot.

However, when asked what is the situation is between us two, she states we're like twins. She also seems to be quite on the fence about how close her interactions are towards me. When out at parties with others from the group, she doesn't seem to be so worried about hugs and other things like that with them. However, when it comes to me. She seems to make a fuss about it. Not willing for hugs, sitting close or so on. Things that seem like textbook girly reactions. And it's not because I'm being blatantly obvious about wanting to start or engaging in such interactions. She admittedly doesn't seem to be as bad when keeping her distance, when we're somewhat alone. But not to the same degree as the others.

We spoke about people dating one another in our friend circle, and she seemed to be against it as she doesn't want to ruin things for the future. But she is known for been extremely secretive.

He said that he didn't feel the same way towards me as i did towards him, and therefore just didn't see us together in the long run. It hurt, of course, but i understood that it would be for the better for us to break up now, as opposed to us holding out until the end of university and then going our separate ways.

Now for the hard part. I was in a car accident this last spring, i was in the hospital for about a month, with multiple broken bones and a plethora of other injuries; one of which included a head injury. 

I lost the vast majority of all my memories from before the accident. I could still remember who i was, who my family and friends were, how to take care of myself (once the physical injuries had healed), and much of what i had learned in high school. However, i have little to no recollection of actually experiencing anything. I knew who my best friend was, but i couldn't tell you anything we had done or talked about. I knew a lot about math and science, and knew that i had learned a lot in school, but do not recall actually sitting in class. 

I had been dating my now ex for a few months prior to the accident, he came to visit me in the hospital, and took great care of me once i was discharged and was very supportive, i moved in with him shortly after, and him and i enjoyed a healthy relationship with few issues that were always resolved quickly. There was nothing that caused our break up, no fights, no infidelity, i honestly had no idea that it was about to happen.

It did though, i have moved all my stuff from his place back into my parents house which is a town away. Now, i just don't know what to do. I know I have dated guys in the past and had to deal with break ups. But i don't remember what it felt like, it really hurts, i cry myself to sleep at night because i miss him. I don't know if break ups always hurt this much, or if its only because he was there for me throughout the whole recovery process, which was very long, difficult, and painful. He was there for me and with me for everything that I remember thus far, and its very hard now that he is just gone.

And I told her when it came to something like that, I wouldn't want her to go without me. I guess I'm just uncomfortable with her getting fucked up with the possibility of guys trying to hit on her, without me there. In her eyes, this means that I don't trust her completely, though she didn't get angry, and said it didn't hurt her, but that I had nothing to worry about and that no amount of alcohol could ever lead her to messing up what we have. I thought that was incredibly sweet, and I honestly do trust her completely (in my eyes, at least), but I definitely can't hide the fact that I'd have anxieties about her partying without me there.

I do know she truly loves me, and I guess I just worry that while she says she'd never do those things, that may change when her judgement is more clouded.

We currently live together in his parents basement trying to get enough money together to get our own place. I am a martial arts instructor, which is how we met (his mom works for the same company). He works at panera, and both jobs pay very poor money.

My boyfriend, Jack never gets along with other people at his work, except for this one girl named Carlie who works on line with him. Now I'm perfectly fine with him having female friends, or at least I think I am. I also really trust him and believe 100% that he wouldn't do anything to hurt me. But there's a few things that have occurred that really bother me and he doesn't understand why.

&amp;nbsp;
I can list off a couple things that bother me the most. First he obviously switches his shifts around at work to be able to work with her, not that big a deal, I would want to work with friends too. He texts/snapchats her a lot more than he texts/snapchats me, but we're also together almost all the time. He tells me he's coming home right after he gets off work sometimes but then ends up staying after to talk to her and doesn't let me know until he's home. Whenever I ask what he was up to while I'm at work he will sometimes leave out that he hung out with her because he thinks it would upset me. I have told him that I prefer nobody but he and I be in our room because I like my privacy and our room is often a mess. He has had her over, in our room, four times, even though I told him every time how much it bothers me (this is the main issue). Then today is what really set me off. He handed me his phone to look up something while he was driving, on the screen was his messages with Carlie. There was a picture that said This is a coupon for one free nude picture. Granted, this is something he would send all of his other friends, he didn't understand how I believed this was ridiculously inappropriate. 

&amp;nbsp;
Now the icing on the cake is this is the girl he wants us to try to be roommates with. Every time I try to tell him I'm not comfortable with this he just gets mad and says that I don't trust him and want to shut down his ideas. I don't want this disagreement to hurt our relationship, but I am positive moving in with this girl will definitely do just that. I don't think I'm the jealous type, but all of these things seem like way more than just being friends. 

&amp;nbsp;
I should add, I truly do not believe he has been cheating on me or anything like that, I need him to see the strain some of these things is putting on our relationship, and how suspicious it is beginning to seem. I want to find a way to have this conversation and share my concerns with him without him getting upset and thinking I'm just being jealous and controlling.

It all happened on Friday night, but I tried to take yesterday to wrap my mind around it before doing anything. I told my boyfriend I was spending time with my family yesterday (what wasn't a lie) but he wants to see me tonight and I'm not sure if I can.

My boyfriend ""Josh"" and I had been dating since September before he asked me out in November. He and I had met through mutual friends at uni around May, and started hanging out more and more often. I realised I was interested in him a month later, but didn't want to get into another relationship as my ex and I had broken up in the beginning of the year. I knew he was into me as well, but tried to tell him I didn't feel ready to get into another relationship any soon. However, throughout the following months, he did his best to show me we should give it a shot. He was patient with me being hesitant, and I felt he really knew me well, that we connected. We started going out, and I fell harder for him, so didn't hesitate when he asked me to be his girlfriend.

I met Josh's best friend, let's call Matt, in July. Matt told me Josh was excited about me, and that he seemed to truly like me. Matt and I got along well, and once I even thought that, if I didn't like Josh, I'd probably be into Matt instead (and that thought doesn't help much now). We have a lot of interests in common, so Josh would encourage us to spend time together and talk. They've been best friends since they were kids, so Josh really wanted us to get along. He used to say we are his two favourite people in the world, so it meant a lot that we got along.
So, pretty much, Josh, Matt and I hang out often and I never noticed anything strange/off. Josh trusts Matt 100%, so he would always go to him whenever we had an argument for advice. Josh doesn't have that much experience with relationships, and Matt is more mature. That's another reason why what happened last night came as a shock.

The three of us were at this friend's house party. Josh has very low tolerance, and he passed out on the sofa. My friend told me I could get him to his room, so he could sleep there instead. I asked Matt for help, and I could tell he was drunk. I felt a bit tipsy, but was sobering up. I asked him if everything was ok, because Josh had told me he'd been acting distant. He looked away and took a deep breath. Then he asked me if we could talk outside. Since Josh seemed to be sleeping fine, and Matt looked upset, I went outside with him, and we sat on the stairs. Now I don't know if I wish I hadn't said yes to talking.

Matt started off by asking me if I remembered the time Josh brought me my favourite dessert and film to watch when I got ill last year. I said of course I did, since it was one of the things that made me think Josh was an amazing guy for remembering something I only mentioned once. Matt said that Josh didn't, he did. That he was the one who remembered me mentioning that the first time the three of us hung out. Then he asked me if I liked how Josh asked me out. I hesitated as I could see where that was going, but said yes anyway. He again said it was his idea. That he was the one who helped Josh realise what he had done wrong the first time we had an argument (it was something small, but Josh is really stubborn), and told him how he should apologise. He mentioned some other things, and they were all things that had made me believe I should try being with him. I was speechless, but eventually managed to ask him if it all (meaning all the things I liked about Josh) had been him. He denied, and even looked shocked at my assumption. He said Josh truly loved me, just needed some help. As his best friend, he wanted to see him happy so he helped. The he took a pause... and took my hand. I couldn't react. He told me that, as time went by, he realised that he wasn't just happy for Josh, but he was happy that those things made me happy. That he started acting through Josh. That he told his best friend to do what he would do if he were with me. And that it made him smile to know I liked them. I look at his hand stroking mine, and he stopped. He asked me to look at him. I brought myself to stare into his eyes, and he said he was sorry, but he had to let me know he really liked me. That he didn't want to backstab his best friend, but had been holding it in for a while and didn't know how to be around us anymore. That he knew he was putting me in a difficult position, but that maybe I could help Josh worry less about him being distant. That he would work on his feelings so that he wouldn't affect our relationship. He ended by saying I was an amazing girl, and that Josh was lucky to have me. 

I was frozen for a while. No one was around, the ones who were still up were in another room. Josh was still asleep when I checked on him. I sent him a text saying I got a ride home with a girlfriend because I didn't want to wake him up. Then I did ask my friend to take me home and haven't seen either of them since. Matt hasn't messaged/texted, only Josh, but I don't know how to feel right now. Part of me is mad at Matt for telling me, as he knew that would put me in a very difficult position. Then I think about how I decided to give Josh and I a chance because of those little things he did/remembered - and how they were Matt's ideas. So I feel really confused.

Let me say that I do feel happy with Josh, and that everything was fine in our relationship. He's kinda immature at times, but I always thought it's because of his lack of experience. He's a really caring boyfriend. He trusts Matt a lot, and always have. So I don't know what I should do. I don't want Josh to know about Matt's feelings as I am scared their friendship will suffer. But keeping it from him sounds wrong too. I am now wondering if I would have decided to get with Josh if he hadn't done those sweet things, but don't want to confront him with that because that would mean him knowing that Matt told me - what makes Matt a bad friend, as he betrayed their friendship. Whenever I complimented Josh for being so thoughtful, he would always say thanks but never mention it was someone else's advice.

I just don't know what to do, or think. I am scared of seeing Josh later tonight, scared I won't manage to act naturally. I don't know if I want to see him. Should I talk to him? Should I get Matt to talk to him? Should I ask to talk, the three of us together? Any perspective will be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

There's a bit of a backstory to this really complicated situation, but I'll try to keep it short. 

Way back in mid-high school, my friend group became friends with this girl Kate online, who lived in another country 12 hours away.

I became friends with Kate just before entering college. We initially bonded over our similar experiences being trans and depressed (fun times . . .), and started talking every day, all the time. 

At the time, Kate was best friends with my other friend, Leah. Leah is around a year younger than me and Kate is around a year older than me, so I'd say at the time, Leah was like 16 and Kate was 19 or 20. This will be important later. 

I began to realize that Kate's behavior was maybe not so good. She would always talk about how she hated herself and how she was a horrible person, and part of me was like ""depression is horrible, I'm sorry."" But I also was beginning to feel like she was taking it to the extreme. Like, she would literally bring up how horrible she was ALL THE TIME, every single conversation. 

Shit hit the fan around Christmas. I got a frantic text from Leah, telling me she needed to talk to me. Apparently she and Kate had NOT been best friends-they'd been secretly dating for several months, and she'd just broken up with her and was afraid Kate was going to kill herself. Through her suicidal hysteria, Kate revealed to me that she had a long history of self-harming and suicide attempts which she had not told Leah about. I spent that night trying to console Leah, talk Kate down from suicide, and contact the authorities in Kate's home country.


Anyway, the truth came out over the next few days. Little things that Kate had done around me (talked about how she hated herself, was kind of rude/snappy) were multiplied tenfold to Leah. Leah revealed that Kate had basically been using her as a therapist, just dumping all of her depression and bipolar problems on her and refusing to get any sort of other help. She would say things like Leah was the only reason she was alive, she didn't have any reason to live except Leah, and Leah, honestly, felt super uncomfortable about that. She told Kate they couldn't be together while she continued to use her as an emotional crutch. 

Kate was obviously way more depressed than any of us had realized. She started cutting soon after and would tell us all about it. Very quickly, I could not speak to Kate without her mentioning self-harming or suicide. We encouraged her to get help, get therapy, tell a counselor, offered to call for her, ANYTHING, but nothing. She lied to Leah that she was attending therapy to get her to start talking to her again, and then told me she'd stopped going. 

Talking to Kate was horrible. Don't get me wrong, I truly wanted to help her, but at the same time, it's not fair to use your friends as therapists. She used to be someone I could talk about my issues with. Soon our conversations all went something like this; 

ME: I'm worried about my final tomorrow, feeling really sick. 

Kate: That's nice. I'm worried about killing myself because I'm unlovable garbage. 


The the conversation would just turn into her talking about how bloody her shirt was because she cut herself too deep or something. If I tried to change the subject she would change it back to her depression lightening fast. 

Leah and I knew it was a cry for help but we'd literally been doing everything we could for months already. It got to the point where Kate would message me and I'd feel sick already, just anticipating how draining and triggering the ensuing conversation would be. And she also got really mean and rude often (being bipolar is tough). We'd beg her to get therapy, she'd talk about how stupid we were for suggesting that and that she hated therapists and medication and then go on talking about her depression.

I should also mention that there was a week where I genuinely thought Kate was dead, because she told me she'd overdosed on pills and dropped off the grid for a week. Turns out it's hard to overdose on sleeping pills.

Now that I had some perspective, there were several things about Leah and Kate's relationship that bothered me. First is the age difference, 3 or 4 years. I feel like this imbalance of power allowed for Kate to basically emotionally abuse her for a long time. Leah was not prepared for the intensity and darkness that Kate brought to the relationship. Also, as a depressed person, I know that it's absolutely not okay to dump your depression on your friends. Your friends should support you but you cannot tell them that you're garbage and should die every conversation. It's not fair to them. That's what therapy is for. That is NOT what your girlfriend is for. There were a lot of other specific instances Leah told me about where Kate bulldozed over her feelings. Things like Leah setting boundaries (do not message me, please don't talk to me about those things, don't talk to me that way etc.) and Kate not respecting them. 

Anyway, Leah eventually told me that she was going to cut off contact with Kate. Kate had continued to use her as an emotional crutch even after they'd broken up, and Leah was extremely unhappy. Kate was still one of the only friends that I had, but I cut contact with her too because I felt like I couldn't continue to be friends with someone who had treated my friend so badly. I just stopped responding to Kate's messages, and eventually she stopped sending them. 

I've realized since then how much stress and anxiety Kate was causing in my life. We did everything we could to help her, but in the end, mental illness does not excuse bad actions. Leah is handling it like a champ-she's admitted that she felt very emotionally abused, but also sorry for Kate, and hopes that Kate seeks therapy one day so that they can be friends again. 

I genuinely thought all that was in the past. 

UNTIL today, when Kate messaged me, telling me she was going to be in my hometown for my birthday. 


I was seriously just like ???????? How could she possibly think I'd want that????

Apparently the rest of the group is still great friends with Kate. I don't talk to most of them anymore so I had no idea this was happening. They don't know the entire situation, but they do know parts. They invited Kate to stay at one of their houses for a while. This is not a cheap trip. Kate lives on the other side of the world. The flight is going to be easily $1500+. Kate's going to be in my hometown, hanging out with my friends, for maybe even a month.

What the fuck do I do? What does Leah do? Leah doesn't want to see Kate. I don't want to see Kate. I'm worried that we'll keep getting invited out by Kate and have to keep making increasingly unbelievable excuses. Saying to her face that we don't want to see her is not an option-we both fully believe she'll kill herself. The Kate situation sucks because Leah and I are both afraid to say anything harsh to her, because she's in such a delicate state of mind. We'd both rather suffer a little than risk her killing herself. At the same time, I'm telling you now that there is no way Kate is coming to my birthday party, if only because Leah is co-hosting. If we asked and explained I believe our friends would uninvite Kate, but I've no idea how they'd do that without basically saying ""None of your friends want you to visit,"" which again I think would just result in Kate killing herself. 


Anyway, that was super long but do you guys have any advice? Like, any ways I can not outright tell Kate not to talk to either of us while avoiding her as much as possible? Any excuses I can make to not see her?

94026,Non-Romantic,2gr7bz,"My friend Steve (22M) had a girlfriend Jaynie (22 or so? I don't really know her) and she recently broke up with him after a seven year relationship. They dated since high school and basically, she was his world (he thought he was going to marry her). He doesn't have a large circle of close friends (he's kind of shy, not really good with people) and has been having work/family problems (family drama, he didn't get a job he applied to so he's stuck at some place he doesn't appreciate). He [I hope] views me as a little sister. I've known Steve for about 4 years and I have a boyfriend [19M]. 

Recently (before the break up) Steve and Jaynie had been distant or anything and as far as I know, she found somebody new. So I've been trying to cheer up Steve by saying things along the lines of ""Hey it's alright, if you ever need to talk I'm here"" or attempts to cheer him up/advice/motivating things but he just becomes sad again. Steve's a pretty sensitive guy and I'm not so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong either. For instance some instances of conversation the day she broke up with him ad he called me(not word for word of course but something like this): 


""Hey OP.."" 

""What's wrong?"" 

""She broke up with me."" 

""Jaynie?""

""Yeah""

""Really?""

""Yeah..I tried to talk to her today and say how I feel and what I want to do moving forward...and she broke up with me. We're different people now..no longer aligned"" **

""Oh I'm sorry..you guys with together for a long time. A lot of things change in that time"" 

""Yeah I know."" 

""People change--you're not the same person you were in high school and neither is she--people move on"" 

""Yeah..I was in high school..then college..now working..life obligations now"" 

""Why did she break up?"" 

""We both weren't happy recently and she decided to cut it..she had interest in someone else anyway"" 

""Oh well if you want to listen I'm here to talk and I can give advice? It'll be okay Steve"" //bad attempts to console him 

""I'm not really looking for advice, I just want to talk so I can stop crying and stuff"" 

""Oh sure that's fine--go ahead and talk, rant, whatever"" 

""Uhm OP...?""

""Yes?""

""I don't like to say it this way but...""  //really long pause  ""I kind of want another girl to go cry to--something like that to look for comfort and compassion"" ***

""Uh well that's fine you need comfort and compassion--do you have anybody to talk to right now?"" 

""No--I'm not really good with people...she probably would not have left me if I was good with people right?"" 

""No -- her feelings changed, circumstances changed. I dunno what happened, but I honestly doubt you did something wrong. If she had problems with you being bad with people she wouldn't have been with you for 7 years"" 

""I want a hug and a kiss already...and now I have nothing...how do I sleep tonight"" ****

""Why don't you sleep with a stuffed animal?"" 

""All of them were the ones she bought me... It's going to be quiet from now on...no more talking to her about everything..."" 

---

**I know he definitely said ""no longer aligned"" because that took me off guard and I don't really believe in that stuff, but yeah I don't know. 

***Okay what uh I have a bf and I don't know I'm not your mom or your bf and idk 

****Whoa what are you asking me for something like that 


And then he trails on about her for the next 10 minutes etc... and occasionally going back to ""I love you OP"" and it's kind of awkward (?) I guess because I want to cheer up Steve but I have a boyfriend too. And also because he's 4 years older than me so it's kind of awkward... I guess he wants something from me too? But everything I saw always goes back to Jaynie pretty much and he gets himself into a sad mopey depressed state and he just sounds SO SAD. :( Also, even when they were together he was kind of a..sad person I guess. He works very hard and tries hard but he seems to always be stressed/tired or something. I don't even know.

41754,Dating,3h50ux,"So I recently started a certificate program for the summer that ends at the end of September and started a few weeks ago. I didn't really notice this guy, we'll call him John, until a few weeks ago when I felt his gaze on me often. At first I didn't think anything of it because I didn't want to just assume but as time has gone on it has gotten obvious to me. 

I'll laugh and he'll look back at me in class (he sits up and to the right of me so it's out of his way) or we'll be working in groups and I'll see him looking at me from across the room. We had to introduce ourselves and he ended up asking me about my schooling a few classes later which made me feel like he paid attention to what I was saying because I honestly don't even remember his introduction haha. The next class (this Monday) I came in and was talking to someone and facing his direction and I felt his gaze on me the whole time (30 seconds ish) that I started feeling shy and turned red. Then he heard me talking later that night and I said something about my ex nonchalantly to someone else and he came right over and started talking as well as made a joke about my ex of some sort (nothing rude but just like oh yeah where's he). We talked some more and he kept my pace walking back in which was cute.

The looks have continued and the other day we were sitting across each other in separate rooms working with our groups and I kept feeling his gaze so I waved to let him know I acknowledge his looking at me and he laughed and nodded back.  Then today we talked a bit and said good morning which is more than usual. Most of us in the class went to lunch as a group and he stayed near me as well as had the option of sitting in a few seats but decided to sit next to me and talk and make jokes. I was also getting a drink and got him his straw and cover and he told me needed them when I offered but never ended up using them lol. So that made me think as well.

I guess I just want an unbiased opinion on whether he's into me or not because I want to make it obvious to him that I am into him without looking dumb! I had been in a relationship for years before this and don't know if I'm feeling like he's into me for no reason or if I'm overlooking his interest towards me. I feel like I wouldn't think he was into me if it wasn't for the looks and staring he's been doing. My friends told me that since he's younger, albeit not that younger, that I shouldn't expect him to make any moves so I just want all of your wonderful opinions! Sorry if this sounds stupid but I just needed to get it all out and advice on what I should do! Thanks ahead!

First off this is my first post and a throwaway. Now, I know its normal to have expectations when looking into a relationship but my expectations for my crush(lets call her Alice) are only limited to her.

 I have had my crush for Alice for 4 year from the start of high school, and told her at her house only days before our graduation how I felt and if we could hang out sometime. Alice said yes and I was so happy I ran all the way. I always thought I wanted any girlfriends i would have to be virgins so that if we were to ever to get married I would be her only lover. The thought of Alice having sex with another man always disgusted me.

My expectations never seemed like a problem until recently when I befriended a girl[17F](lets call her Maddie). We became close friends quickly to the point where she felt comfortable telling me how she lost her virginity. Because we where close and very friendly towards each other a friend of Maddie asked if her and I were dating and when I said no, he followed up by asking if I would be willing to date her , to which I reply I would but I already have someone in mind(Alice).

I knew Maddie wasn't a virgin but I still said yes to that question. Now I feel like douche for only wanting this expectation from Alice.Am I Douche? Why do I think this way?

We decide to chat on facebook to get to know each other anyway - maybe pen pals/friends to start, or so I thought.

We're chatting over the first couple days (cute, flirty stuff) when she asks if I've been on another date with someone else - bear in mind, I've known this girl for all of three days. I had actually been on a simple first date but didn't know the right thing to say here. I believe in honesty so I say I had but that it was a casual first date (it was) and nothing special. She immediately says she's not interested in being with ""that guy"" and proceeds to tell me we can't possibly get to know each other if I'm constantly ""on the prowl"" for dates and that she's not ""that type of girl."" I tried to explain how I actually don't date much to begin with and that it kind of sounds like she expects exclusivity over long distance, without having met, and knowing her for all of three days.

20073,Breakups,23peug,"We had a very happy long distance relationship for two years, with each of us visiting often.  Then a year ago, she was moving into my state.  I was thrilled! She was everything I could have wanted in a woman and more.  I helped her move, I was moving out of my parents’ house, and it was really great.  Then the lease came up.  I wanted to sign it with her, but I didn’t have a job.  She didn’t mind, worked from home, and I trusted her with money.  But my parents were also in state, and talked me out of signing onto the lease.  But I had to sign it to live there, right?  There wasn’t actually a good reason for me to not sign it.  But I didn’t sign it.  My parents mentioned that she “could die” (not in a threatening way) and then I would be stuck with a lease that I couldn’t afford.  A long-shot, I know, but it was enough for me to not sign it apparently.  I wasn’t doing what I wanted right then and there.

Having just graduated college, I found a job after a few months, and it wasn’t so bad.  I had some money coming in, so I paid her some of the rent.  I paid the Internet bill from the start because I’m techy and know how to handle that really well.  For a while everything was okay.  But she never let me live down not signing the lease.

We kept arguing over little things.  It wasn’t bad a first, but she never wanted to talk about our issues.  She would always say that she was tired, or that she didn’t want to.  I couldn’t force her to talk about something she refused to talk about.  She would sometimes just say that she didn’t have anything else to say on that topic, and leave it at that.  That doesn’t help either!  Why can’t we just discuss our issues and get through each one?  So they built up over time.

She cooked almost always and did the laundry most of the time.  I always put my laundry in the bins so she wouldn’t have to go hunting for clothing throughout the apartment.  She threw her clothes/towels/items all over the place, not really caring where they were lying.  She blamed being messy on getting out of her previous and stressful relationship (an abusive alcoholic) before moving, but she should have been over him before we were even together, and even more so being in a completely new environment.  When she didn’t feel like cooking, I usually offered to cook something, but she said she didn’t want to eat anything I knew how to cook.  I knew how to make a few things, and was willing to learn, but it didn’t matter because she never ate anything I made for her anyway, except this one time when she was sick and I made her soup.

I almost always did the dishes.  She would do them once in a while, but usually only picked up plates and things from the living room/already in the kitchen.  She left the dishes out all over the place, especially the bedroom, and I always had to figure out where things got to.  They sometimes found their way under her dirty clothes and I would find them weeks later with mold and disgusting… stuff on them.  I don’t think I should be the only one putting things in the sink/dishwasher here.  I tried talking to her about it a lot.

I walked the dog/fed the cats (she had the dog and cats before we started dating) most of the time.  I worked for 5 hours with an hour commute each day.  She wanted the dog to go out three times a day.  Assuming 9 hours of sleep, which we got, that leaves 15 hours, so the dog should go out every 5ish hours.  I almost always walked the dog in the mornings, no problem.  I almost always walked the dog late at night, no problem.  But she refused to take the dog out before I got home so that I wouldn’t have to do it.  After getting home, I didn’t want to immediately take the dog out.  I wanted to relax for half an hour at the very least, but that would mean the timing would be messed up.  The dog was on diet food, and was pooping a lot more than usual, so she really needed to go out three times a day.  A few times I was curious what would happen if I didn’t take the dog out, and she just didn’t seem to notice.  So I resigned myself to just always taking her out immediately when I got home because I didn’t want the dog to suffer.

She went on this big trip to Europe with her best friend, which is great.  They don’t live near each other, or get to see each other often, but when she came back, she was significantly more protective of what she had been doing and her privacy.  Her phone had a password on it, which was unusual, but not uncommon while traveling.  She had been to France on her trip and got angry at me a few times for not always walking with her and holding her hand like the people there did.  She must have liked it a lot because of the culture.  I did my best after that to oblige her in that respect, but it didn’t seem to help her attitude.

Something else I noticed was that well before the trip, I would be on my phone most of the time while we were shopping.  She brought it up as an issue, so I only occasionally checked my phone while we were shopping.  I’m not terribly interested in shopping, but I did it for her, and found that I could enjoy it with her.  But after the trip, she was constantly on her phone and I was the one alone looking around.  I brought it up once and she said that she had to talk to her best friend because she was getting married soon.  True she was, but all the time?  It was hard to pull her away from her phone/laptop to talk to her.  Kissing her became annoying to her because I was in between her and her device.  I also did this thing where I would kiss her three times quickly, and she said to just kiss her once and to stop.  I was taken aback right there.

Sex became a rarity.  She used the same excuses with sex that she did with arguments.  Not now, I’m tired… okay yeah, but every single night?  I feel that she should have been the one to initiate it if she was refusing.

Maybe she might have just needed some space from such a long trip, so I gave it to her.  It turned out she was pregnant.  I was really surprised because we were pretty careful, using condoms, but it was possible.  She wanted an abortion, saying she wasn’t ready for a baby, or babies as the tests had shown.  I agreed, but told her that I wouldn’t leave her if she decided to have them.

She always complained about how her phone was slow, so I bought her a new one that she liked, assuming that she wouldn’t put a password on it.  In the past, she wouldn’t put one on unless she had an actual reason.  She would visit her parents, and they would go through her stuff.  But the password went right back up.  I wasn’t going to look through her phone, but it was uncharacteristic of her.

After that, she made a few trips to the city where her connecting flight happened to come out of a few times, saying it was for work.  I believed her, as she did have work up there before, but it still smelled fishy to me.  I didn’t want to believe that she was cheating/had cheated on me.

She brought up was how we never went out.  I had asked a few times in the past if she wanted to do various things on various days, but she never really wanted to do anything besides sit around and watch TV/play video games together, which was fine.  But I planned dates and set things up so that we could explore the area together just the same.  Each day would have been a different experience.  I had a week off of work to do it, so it was really the perfect opportunity.  But then…

We had a big fight about money.  Mostly how to pay the rent.  I was paying her in cash for a while, which she didn’t know what to do with.  I eventually started paying with a check, but she wanted me to take a check from her, deposit it at a bank, get a cashier’s check, and physically hand it to the apartment managers.  This seemed like a lot more work to me than me giving her a check, and her mailing it to her out of state bank, and paying online like she always had.  I still wasn’t on the lease like I should have been. 

In that heated argument, we broke up.  It was mostly mutual.  She said she wanted me to be free and grow on my own for a while.  To live my life without her and just experience things on my own.  I didn’t exactly have anywhere else to go, but I couldn’t live with my now ex-girlfriend, so I moved back in with my parents.  This is hell because they never approved of our relationship.  My dad insists on telling me what to do and constantly checks up on me when I’ve told him that, while I appreciate his support, I don’t need to be checked up on constantly.  My mom almost openly disliked my ex-girlfriend.

In that fight, I asked if she had cheated on me because I was suspicious, and she said she hadn’t.  I really want to believe her, but she was acting very strangely since that trip.  I resigned to believe her until I had actual evidence, but it’s not like it mattered very much anymore.  She also made it clear that she wanted to live in my own apartment and gain experience.

Another thing she mentioned was that I never said I loved her.  She hadn’t either, but she did mention that it shouldn’t take 3 years to say it.  Regardless of that, she had said she “half loved me” and stuff like that at points in our relationship.  It was cute, but a surprise each time.  I haven’t had anyone outside of my family ever tell me they loved any fraction of me.  One thing I probably need to work on is being true to my feelings and just doing stuff about it.

We agree that there’s room for us to get back together in the future, and we still want to be friends.  But until she can talk about and comprise on relationship issues, I don’t think it’s possible.  I don’t think she’ll be able to have a long lasting and happy relationship until she can talk through a problem with someone.  She also says that I need to “grow and live on my own” for a while.

68006,Relationships,2s7s6j,"Hello guys,
I am having more and more fights with my girlfriend lately. 
It started with her use of snapchat. She sends text messages to one guy and frequently exchanges pictures with two other guys. In the week we don't see each other, as we live in different towns (not that far away though) while she goes out with those two guys (and a female friend).
I wasn't very comfortable with that.
The more I got interested in what they were sending each other the more she seemed to pay attention to not let her phone lay around when I was with her. That made me concerned even more.
To get some information on what was going on I went as far as checking regularly, how many snaps she gets and thought about what the hell they could be sending each other all the time(just made me uncomfortable even more, seeing that she got a big number of snaps).

I am pretty sure she is not cheating on me, but it just bothers me. 
I told her that and she reacted very emotional, telling me that it is not normal to have a problem with that and that it wouldn't be of my business as long as she doesn't send something inappropriate.
Moreover, I had some other bad habits, like asking what she was talking about/doing while she was going out(I have stopped since she complained about it). Or repeatingly telling her to not drink too much etc.
I also told her that I found it bizarre when she told me that at a bar she had joked around with her (female) friend, moving her boobs suggestively, worrying about the fact that guys might be around and that they might have looked. Or I told her that I didn't like her taking a particular dress with a big decolleté when going out with other guys.
She responded if I wanted her to wear a burqa and that she would wear whatever she likes.

We were really jealous in the beginning of our relationship to the point that she only had female friends and me only male friends. With her doing all the things I talked about above I feel like I might just need some time to readapt to that.
She says that she would never be like that with me if I had female friends now. I think she would also be pretty jealous but I can't say as I don't go out with female friends regularly.
She also told me lately (after heavy insisting on this subject by me) that she lied to me about something I often asked her about, which might not have helped in the trust department (it wasn't a very bad lie though, actually I prefer the truth than what I thought was true before, so I have forgiven her already).
She described that she feels observed/emprisoned and that if I keep wanting to know everything and bother that much about what she does when I am not around she would end our relationship. We were very happy at the beginning of our relationship but it doesn't work that well anymore. She seems to be less in love and also less interested in having fun in bed (I made a deal out of her not giving me bjs anymore even though in the beginning she did it like 2-3 times a week-end).

Wanting to get to that state again, I decided that I had to change my behavior.
I realize that me obsessing over what my girlfriend does when she is not with me, isn't a healthy thing to do. Yet, even though I start to digest the fact that she snapchats with guys while we don't, I still get really angry/jealous when I see that she gets a lot of snaps or basically anything that could be a trigger for jealousy. Even if I see that she is online and she doesn't reply to a message to me I will get an angry feeling, thinking who is she talking to instead now..(the real reason seemed to be that apparently sometimes facebook shows online even though somebody doesn't use it). 
Another example is that when she told me that they talked about swallowing sperm at the bar and she said something like if the taste is ok, sure I got angry because she never does it with me and I got the feeling that she just said it to appeal to them..
I am sort of a ticking jealousy time bomb just waiting for a reason to explode..
I try to keep it in, in order not to get in an argument again but I feel like it's dragging our relationship down.
Moreover, I tried being more busy in my town, in order not to spend my evenings thinking about those things and getting to know more people(also female friends).
Trying to talk to her about all this generally ends in an argument and her telling me that I should just let it go. We only keep repeating stuff and it doesn't bring us forward.

Did anybody have a similar situation or a similar behavior and could give me some advice on how to overcome these feelings?
Thank you and sorry for the long text, but I felt like all this was somewhat important.


---   
**tl;dr**: I get really jealous about my gf snapchatting other guys and her going out with them and am over-protective in general.
Was anybody in this situation and managed to get over those feelings?

UPDATE: We made quite some progress. Going out more myself, distracted me from those problems and as I seemed to be bothered less from all this, she got more comfortable talking about it without feeling emprisoned. 
UPDATE 2: She told me something wrong about the frequency of her snapping with those guys. I got upset about it, she said something like you are crazy, it's incredible, but I will delete those guys and you from snapchat so that you won't keep being a pain in the ass about it anymore. Not sure if this is good or bad.

181132,Non-Romantic,3hcij2,"A little bit of back-story before I go into my situation.
My mother is very difficult. She always has been.

She didn't raise me but I lived with her for a few years.

Our relationship has always been really, really strained. One day she likes me and the others she hates my guts, when I lived with her I wasn't allowed to do anything, I wasn't allowed to have friends, I wasn't allowed to go out or do anything, I never got new clothes, I never had anything that fit me and wasn't ripped to shreds almost. It wasn't due to lack of money because my siblings got everything they ever wanted, new consoles, new toys. I never got anything.

She made me drop-out of school to take care of my brothers so she could go to school. I never had a summer job because I had to baby-sit, and if I did have a job. She would keep all of my money. I never got to see a penny of it, not even to buy a new pair of pants that were whole. 

When I was raped by my step-father when I was 12, she told everyone that I was making it up for attention, that I had asked for it, 
I went no-contact after I was 16 and she kicked me out because I didn't want to move to the other side of the country to live with some stranger she met on the internet that she'd known for 2 weeks. 

We started talking again when I was 22, I thought I was strong enough to handle her and her moods. We got along okay now that I was older and she seemed to have calmed down, but I would hear through the grapevine how she would talk really bad about me behind my back, how I was this terrible person. 

I managed to finish school and get a okay job, I get promoted and I'm doing pretty well for myself, she inserts herself into my life and tries to act like it's her good parenting that got me this far in life. Which isn't true.

She starts being really nice to me, but hates everyone that has supported me through the years, all my friends are terrible, my boyfriend is abusive (he isn't) everyone is the worst. I should quit my job and come live with her. 

I don't do that. Then she wants me to be a surrogate mother for her and her new fiance (The 10th one in as many years), I refuse. Then I'm terrible and the worst daughter ever.




She's talked to me for hours on end about how my older brother is the worst and that he's a useless sack of crap, and how she hates him and doesn't want him near the house etcetc, she just bought tickets for them to go to Florida for a few weeks. 
This isn't her money she's spending, it's her fiancees.


This is just a small percent of stuff she's done over the years.

Now onto my current situation..


She's now decided to be mother of the year. She's having this family reunion this weekend in a place that takes 4 hours to drive to, I told her I was going to go but it turns out that this weekend is the worst weekend for me to go. I have work and it's my busiest weekend of the year and as the manager I have to spend the weekend working, plus a lot of my employees are on vacation so I might have to work a whole lot more than I originally thought and it's just not worth the 8 hour round trip just to be there for an hour.

I've already told her that I'll only be one night, but now as the weekend draws near I don't think I could even make it. She's already mad at me because I can't be there the entire weekend, and now I'm just expecting her to explode. 

and if she does, I want to go full no-contact. I can't keep going through the phases of her hating me then not hating me. I need advice on how to deal with this,  She's my mom, but I'm mentally and emotionally exhausted on having to deal with her.

114204,Relationships,2wzl8l,"My boyfriend, Greg, and I have been dating for one year and everything has been going great. We love spending time with each other, our sex life is great, and we have had very little problems/fights overall. In fact, the only fights that we have had have been about these girls. When we first started dating, Greg left his facebook up on my computer. I was nosy and looked through his messages. I was not snooping because I was suspicious of anything; I was more just curious about what he had been telling his friends about me. I know that this was wrong and I shouldn't have done it. 

Anyways, in his messages with his friends, he talked about two girls from home (Greg and I go to the same college) that he had hooked up with over winter break (about a month before we started dating). Apparently these girls were friends and they both got mad at him for hooking up with the other and stopped talking to them. Ok, whatever. I don't really care about who he has hooked up with before we started dating. This was really all that I gathered from the looking through his messages and none of it bothered me. 

However, about a month later (right around the time when we started dating), he started talking to one of the girls, Audrey, again. They talked CONSTANTLY. They basically just had a facebook chat constantly between them. They weren't talking every single second of the day, but they were talking often enough that I began to pick up on it whenever we were together. Any time we were both sitting near his computer, I could see that he was talking to her. And honestly, the conversations sounded pretty flirty. They talked exactly how he would talk to me, lots of sarcastic banter, talking about everyday things, etc.. Eventually I brought it up to him that I noticed he was talking to another girl a lot and that he talked to her differently than he talked to his other friends. He tried to tell me that he talked to her exactly how he talked to his other friends, but I’ve seen enough of his conversations to know that this isn’t true. I ended up asking him if he had had a thing with her and he told me that they had hooked up before (ok great, honesty). After talking a bit, he apologized for it making me uncomfortable and said that he would tone down their conversations and not talk to her as often. I was happy enough with this decision.

About two weeks later, I came into his dorm room and his facebook was open on his computer screen. I glanced at it when I walked in and saw that a chat with Audrey was open. He quickly hurried past me and exited out of her chat, thinking that I hadn’t seen it yet. I confronted him about it and it turned out that he hadn’t been talking to her any less over the past two weeks, he had just been hiding it from me because he thought that if I didn’t know about it, it wouldn’t bother me (what the hell?). I told him that that wasn’t ok, and he apologized for keeping it from me. He said that she had been chatting him first and it would be rude to just ignore her. I can agree with that, but he hadn’t even tried to tone down the conversation or how often they were talking. He told me that I didn’t have a right to dictate who he talks to, even though I wasn’t making them stop contact altogether, just tone it down a bit. Anyways, I got pretty upset about this incident, and even though he didn’t agree with what I was asking him to do, they didn’t talk as much (at least that I noticed) but still chatted fairly often. I think this was mostly because he finally stopped chatting her first so often. He also agreed not to hang out with her alone. 

Flash forward to the summer when I was visiting him. This was the long distance portion of our relationship as we were no longer at college. We had been dating about 6 months at this point. We had basically been trying to avoid the Audrey topic, as any time we talk about it we just end up arguing. So at some point when I was visiting him, his facebook was once again left open on my laptop. I know that this was wrong, but I snooped again. I looked at his chat with Audrey and they had been chatting constantly, even more often than at school. Looking through their messages, a lot of them were verbatim what he would talk to me about. It honestly made me so upset just to see those messages. On one occasion, he accidentally sent me something that he had meant to send to her. It was some weird thing so naturally I asked who he would be talking about that with. He told me it was another one of his friends when in fact it was actually her. Additionally, one night, Greg told me that he was hanging out with two of his male friends and Audrey. Ok, whatever – I didn’t care if he hung out with her in a group. His phone died while he was there and on the train back to his house he said he was using his friend Matt’s phone to message me while they listened to music. However, via Steam, I could see that Matt was at home playing a video game (I wasn’t trying to be a creepy stalker; it was just a coincidence that I noticed this). I asked Greg how he was using Matt’s phone if he was at home and he told me that Matt must have left a game open on his computer. Come to find out, Matt hadn’t even been there hanging out with Greg, Audrey, and his other friend and it was Greg and Audrey taking the same train home. So instead of just telling me that him and Audrey were together (it’s not like I would have been mad at him for being alone with her when they had to take the same train) he lied about who he was with. 

 To add to this even more, the other girl that he had hooked up with, Julia, had messaged him as well. Once again, I wouldn’t have cared if they were just talking and catching up like normal friends but this was not the case. At some point over the summer (before my visit to see him), he told me that Julia had invited him somewhere with a group and he wasn’t sure if he wanted to go. He had never actually mentioned Julia to me (I only knew about her through snooping) so I asked him who she was. He told me that she was “just a friend from high school” and so I asked why I had never heard about her before. He claimed that they weren’t really that close (bullshit) and that he hadn’t talked to her in a while. He eventually ended up deciding not to go. When I looked through his messages when I visited him over the summer, he had told his friends about me asking about Julia and they were laughing about how he told me that they had just been friends. Apparently he was practically in love with her during high school and spent those years trying to get in her pants. He also told them that ""monogamy is hard"" and that he ""has thoughts."" I feel like our relationship has grown a lot since that time, but the fact that he even said that then killed me. In his chat with Julia, she had apparently heard that he got a new girlfriend and asked him to tell her about me, to which he responded, “ugh do I have to.” I obviously wouldn’t expect him to tell her in depth about our relationship but the fact that he couldn’t even tell her about me hurt a lot. It made it seem like I was some second place prize that he picked up because he didn’t get the girl that he wanted. I went to one of his group chats with his friends and searched for Julia’s name in their conversation. He had told his friends that Julia had chatted him and said something along the lines that he shouldn’t hang out with her in person because he would want to hook up with her. All of this devastated me but I didn’t bring it up to him because (1) I was only visiting him for a few days and didn’t want to ruin it by fighting and (2) I didn’t want to tell him that I had snooped. 

Fast forward to more present day. He hasn’t been talking to Audrey or Julia, to my knowledge. But I just can’t get over the fact that he lied to me about them. I keep getting mad at him about certain things that wouldn’t really matter if I didn’t know the truth about them, like that he has a picture of Audrey saved to his computer or that he has been checking on their facebook profiles. He keeps getting mad at me because he thinks I’m just being an overjealous girlfriend and getting mad about him talking to other girls. I have no problem with any other girls that he’s friends with or hangs out with; it’s just these two because I know the truth about them. Because I’m questioning things like that, he thinks that I don’t trust him and I can tell that this really hurts his feelings. Besides this incident, I would trust him with my life, but he doesn’t believe this since I question him about seemingly small and trivial things. I honestly don’t believe that he has physically cheated on me, but I feel like it has been more of an emotional thing. 

So at this point, I just don’t know what to do. I love him to death and don’t want anything to happen to the relationship that we have. But I just can’t live with the fact that he lied to me and I don’t know how to bring it up to him because I feel horrible about snooping. He’s an absolutely incredible guy and I just don’t know how to deal with this situation. In the last few months the relationship has gotten a lot more serious, and he says that he sees a future together and things like that. I feel like most of the incident has passed but I just don't know how to get over the lying. I know it makes it even worse that I found out through snooping, but at the same time, why wouldn’t he just tell me the truth in the first place?

---------


I've been gaming online with this guy since I was 15 years old. We're *very* close. He knows more about me than any person in my life. Things have been flirty/romantic for a very long time, but circumstances never really made it possible for us to close the considerable geographic distance between us. I am flying there in 2 weeks to meet him in person for the first time. I'm fucking ecstatic.

I've never had sex with anyone without a condom - something which he is aware of. He's never had sex with anyone without a condom - something I do genuinely trust him on. I have an IUD for birth control - something he is also aware of. 

I guess I just assumed, because of our histories regarding condoms, that it was a given that we would be using condoms. I made a joke about who was bringing them, and he was really taken aback... His major concern (with past partners) is that he doesn't always trust the girls to take the pill without messing it up. The fact that I have an IUD eliminates this concern. He assumed the IUD meant we wouldn't be using condoms.

He genuinely seems hurt that I expected to use condoms. I think he was excited about finally being able to go without. Since I have an IUD, he drew the conclusion that I just don't trust him enough to feel certain he doesn't have any STDs. That's not the case - I really do trust him. I just hadn't even considered that sex without condoms was really even an option, I guess. 

So now I'm in this weird 'in between' where I'm thinking... He makes a good point. I'm not going to get pregnant, and I do trust him. Why wouldn't we be able to do it without condoms? But I've so never even considered not using condoms before that I'm like... Am I letting a guy pressure me into something I'm not comfortable with? He's not making a huge issue out of it. He seems to have conceded to using condoms, but I can tell he's disappointed about it. So he's not really actively pressuring me. I'm just upset that this seems to have put a damper on a visit that has been anticipated by us both for a LONG time. 

I'm toying with the idea of just saying fuck it about the condoms. I trust him. But part of me wonders... if a friend was telling me this situation, would I look her in the eye and tell her she was being fucking stupid? I don't know. I think I might.

99599,Relationships,1udnlz,"To start off... I don't know what to call him since we broke up. I'll call him B. B has a best friend named P. Or had. While we were dating, I felt a little suspicious about their relationship. I did the horrible thing of snooping on him, and found that it was a romantic friendship. I was hurt. Cried a lot. Hurt him. Very irrational and stupid.


They stop talking after a while. B likens it to a romantic friendship I had when we started our relationship (we weren't dating but we were exclusive sexually) that I stepped away from because I felt like it wouldn't be right. 


I still end up feeling guilty. And not worth being loved. And guilty. In small bursts. Large bursts. Sometimes I'd cry and apologize. I'm also depressed so it magnified my poor reaction. I know he didn't really take to me talking about it often and I was stupid to take him up on saying that it was okay to do so. 


A few days ago he lets me know that they're talking again now. I feel like his relationship with her is really important to him, which is fine. I'm not against him having female friends; but I'm not comfortable with a girl who has recently said she wants to kiss him and that she's in love with him.


I'm depressed, anxious (like him actually) but I self harm as well. The night before I was really anxious and I hurt myself, so the day when he brought it up, I was already a mess. I flipped out like a moron, told him I wasn't comfortable and that I didn't want to play monkey in the middle again. He dumped me. I cried, I started panicking because I was so stressed and I was already thinking about suicide for weeks and then I was panicking and it came to a head -- I let him know I would stop talking and sending those really sad bargaining texts and that I was calling an ambulance. I didn't feel safe taking myself home and not hurting myself. (I hadn't been seeing my therapist enough because of my job, but that's a story for another sub.)


So. He lets me know that the breakup is for good after I get out of the hospital. But that he wants to try to work out our problems. I have a lot of personal problems to work on -- I know I probably sound like an insane bitch but a lot of the times when I start freaking out, it doesn't feel like I'm speaking. I'm just panicking. And he knows. I'm responsible for it. I'm not a bad person I'm just not well right now.

But. I don't know how to work it out with him. I don't know if I want it to go back to being the me and him and her show. I don't know if I'm mentally stable enough to deal with trying to squash my jealousy (or if I should even do so) and rebuild this on uncertain terms. He said we're both single, just not free to do anything, and if working it out takes too long we could just see other people. It doesn't make sense to me. I know I'm young and there are plenty of other people and the same for him. But I still have a lot of love for him and it's difficult feeling like I'm being tested on some imaginary measure of getting my shit together, yet that friend can be a complete mess and he'll still love her more than me.


I feel like I'm clinging, but if we were both healthy and I knew it wasn't going to get like this again, I'd want to stay. But there's no where for me to stay. And he's still treating me like we're together, but will assert that we're not. We were talking about going to see one of our therapists together to evaluate if this was a good thing to save. My post is really biased and perhaps too harsh but I've been upset for a while and it's hard to see it with clarity by myself.

Most of it is regarding a relationship or sexual nature. It's not the acts or facts themselves that bother me, it's the deception. 

It's a lot of things. She says she's never posted any nude pictures online, then I find a couple on an old profile of hers. She says she's never really played around too much sexually, then she mentions a few things she done sexually previously that are a lot more adventurous than she had led me to believe. Some of the stuff I'm not even really interested in, and it doesn't bother me that she's done this stuff with other people - everybody has a past. It bothers me that she's lied to me about it. I also know that everybody's definition of what is adventurous is different as well, but there are specific acts that she's said she will not do or has not done which she has later said she's tried before. 

Everybody has a right to privacy in their past and if she didn't want to discuss the past I would've been fine with that, but her telling me one thing then either telling me another later, or finding out through some other credible means later that what she has told me makes me wonder what else she's bothered lying to me about.

I am less selfish, more patient, more aware and respectful of other people's things and feelings and no longer a materialistic person. This extends to my entire life and not just my relationship and it's a wonderful change that I love about myself that started with this guy. I've had problems in the past with being selfish and wanting things to go my way or no way and I'm wondering if I'm falling back into old habits or if I have a legitimate reason to be upset and hurt.

In the beginning of our relationship, I would stay the night at his house a lot and he stayed the night at mine once. I fought and fought and fought for him to stay at mine more until I realized that it made him uncomfortable to stay. I decided that him being happy and comfortable was more important than getting my way (because honestly I didn't care much where we were if we were spending time together even though it was a little inconvenient to spend the night at his place) so I let it go and never asked him to come over again and assumed if we were spending time together it was going to be at his place.

At first I would spend the night a couple times a week. Then a few times a week. Now it is every single night of the week. I don't mind. He has anxiety and has a hard time falling asleep on his own so I'm happy to be there to help even though sometimes it feels like he doesn't really want *me* to be there he just wants *someone* to be there. 

A couple days ago he had a day off and we made plans but he slept until almost 9 at night. I didn't mind.  He definitely needed the sleep because he works really hard and I found lots of things to do to keep me busy. When he finally woke up I was in the middle of relaxing and getting ready for bed because I had class the next morning at 8. I could tell he was irritated at something and it was either me or he was taking it out on me. He wouldn't answer my texts, he was snippy with me. So  I called him and asked what was wrong and he was irritated that we made plans that day and I had spent that last hour that he was awake doing things that I wanted to do instead of going over to his place. He said something about sacrificing for everyone else and no one would make sacrifices for him. I asked him what would make him feel better and tried to talk about why he was upset and the only thing that he said would make him feel better is if I went to his place.

I tried to stand my ground and say no I'm not going; I have to be up early. There's no point in going over there because I'm just going to want to go to sleep. But he was upset and I just wanted him to feel better so I agreed to go over there around 11:30. Now, he said no you don't have to after giving me the cold shoulder for not and I recognized it immediately as emotional manipulation. I wasn't upset about it though because no one is perfect and I can be emotionally manipulative sometimes if I'm not careful.

So I go over there and it is nice. He isn't upset anymore. We spend time together and I don't end up going to sleep until somewhere around 3 in the morning. Again, I don't mind because it made him feel happy and I had a good time too. This was a big compromise for me because I did not want to go over there. I wanted to stay at home with my cats and go to sleep at a normal hour in my bed for the first time in weeks. I feel like it's wrong to think that because I did this for him he should be grateful and recognize when I need something similar from him. Giving isn't really giving if you expect to receive something for it right? 

Fast forward to tonight. I'm leaving for a school trip on Monday and after I got off work  I went over to his place to spend one more night together before I left for the next week. We didn't spend a lot of time together. I got there around 10:30. We took showers separately then his brother came home and he spent some time with him. By 12 he was in bed and going to sleep. I was irritated because he didn't want to spend any time with me even though I was leaving for an entire week. He just wanted to go to sleep immediately after spending almost an hour talking to his brother while I sat alone in his room. 

I got a bit emotional. Maybe I was over reacting. But I needed to feel like he was sad that I was going and that he wanted to spend as much time with me as he could. I am torn though because that is such a selfish feeling. I went with it anyway and bothered him about not wanting to spend time with me for about an hour until he finally admitted that he didn't care how I feel he's going to sleep and he wants me to leave. I felt so sad. Why did't he want to spent time with me? Why didn't he want to talk to me or be with me on our last night together? 

So I selfishly thought about all the things I have done for him, all the sacrifices I have made, all the times I wanted to do something different but I did what he needed or wanted instead. Especially about two nights ago when I drove to his house at midnight on a school night to make him feel better even though I knew he would NEVER have done the same thing for me. never. Is staying awake with me for a little while too much to ask for? I admit it was pretty selfish to keep him from sleeping just for my own wants. I regret that a little. 

He says he loves me but I don't think he does. I think he loves the way I love him and the things I do for him but he doesn't love *me*. He even said the times he felt like saying I love you (before we said I love you) were only when I was doing things for him like making him dinner. 

This post sounds like I'm doing all the changing and he isn't but that isn't true. He has changed some behaviors for me whether he realizes it or not. He is more affectionate and I have learned how to interpret his affection. Now, I feel like my needs are being met in the relationship as a whole and before I didn't feel that way. Its just rare times when I feel like I really really need something and he won't make any sacrifices on his part to give it to me. If it's convenient for him he will make it happen of course. 

My big question is. Am I being selfish? Was tonight all my fault? Will he ever make big gestures for me? Is it wrong to want him to?

I have this notion in my head that people learn by example and maybe he just hasn't learned how to do that for people so I should keep doing for him what I want him to do for me and eventually he will pick up on it. Is that crazy?

29184,Relationships,21x6em,"I need some relationship advice/help. My SO (34/M) and I (27/F) have been dating a little over 2 years, living together about 9 months. Our sex life is a constant battle as of lately. 

When I first moved in, things were great- had regular sex, exciting, intimate, fun. About 3-4 months into living together the sex became less frequent, less exciting (went from fun shower sex/experimental/lingerie to sex once/twice a week, doggie-style and either he cums in less than a minute or not cum at all and just stops after a couple minutes).

 I started to bring it up and every time we have talked about it in the past 5/6 months we get into a huge argument, and every time I try to to come up with a compromise for us and work through it by talking about what has changed, he gets extremely agitated and shuts down. 

The couple times we've had constructive conversations about it he agreed to talk to his therapist about it, and get his testosterone levels tested. Things he has said in the past are he just isn't interested in having sex multiple times a week and would be fine with once or twice, he's depressed, he's tired- there is a pattern of the same excuses.

 I've asked over and over what I can do to help him- I've tried sending him sexy pictures, lingerie, role play, date nights- things he has recommended we try, but he continues to show little interest. The last conversation we had, he again became frustrated and stated we should just have a calendar- so that's what I did, I made a weekly sex calendar that has us scheduled to have sex 3-4 times a week and as many BJs as be wants when i'm on my period. Since doing that, things have become even more strained- sex feels forced and awkward and I usually end of moving to the couch and crying myself to sleep after he falls asleep because I'm so frustrated and hurt. 

This issue has literally consumed me and it's all I can think about now. It's completely ruining what otherwise is an awesome, loving relationship as I see it seeping into other aspects of our relationship due to the resentment I'm starting to feel. We both understand that we have different sex drives, I want sex everyday, he doesn't - but any compromise we come up with, when it comes to enacting on it- he gets annoyed or I get annoyed . I see how every time I bring this issue up, it makes our intimacy more strained and I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

What else can I do? Should I back off the subject for awhile? 
I just started seeing a therapist myself partially for my mom becoming terminally ill and also because this issue is taking a serious toll on my mental stability.

I would appreciate any insight/advice anyone in similar situations has.

How many times does this question get asked?(could skip to first tl,dr if you don't want to read long story)


I've dated two girls in my life, first one was 6 months which really never felt like a relationship to me but more as a friends that kissed each other goodbye, its a long boring story. The first relationship happened me jr year of highschool when I was 17, easily moved on. Before I started dating the second girl, I tried dating with around 10 different girls, none of them were for me so I never got into a relationship with any of them.


The last girl I dated is what really made me think I'm not worth it for anyone or that I want to be with anyone. This girl was my picture perfect, everything that I wanted in a girl and more. Starting with looks, (if you know what people mean by difference between cute and sexy,i prefer cute) she was cute, I literally could not of asked for any better in terms of her looks. Yeah I'm a guy i know, looks is my attention grabber and personality makes me want to stay. Which, she exceeded my hopes for in both. She was a very caring, humble, fun, and great energy to be around; could of keep going but needed to stop there. One thing that always got me was that she was very conviced that i was settler for her and didn't think she was worth it for me which i found shocking as i was thinking the same with her. Trying to make this short, I am a virgin and she isn't(waiting to have sex until we were both completely comfortable with each other, have been spending nights at each other places though). We were all over each other one night , all hot and heavy and both decided theres no way we could wait any longer. We were planning on going out to a party(we are in college) so I went home to get prepare for the night, showering, dress up, and of course buy some condoms. The party was alright but exhausted us both out as neither one of us were in the mood for sex and just wanted to rest. So I spent the night again but this is were I was just completely dumbfounded and shocked. I'm not a morning person the least bit so I didn't know I was getting the silent treatment from her until she finally said ""Really, you are just gonna sit there?
Eventually she told me that i barely talk and have conversations with her which I think was complete BS.





 Sorry, im really trying to keep this short; so of course I try talking to her but she isn't being very responsive and it's like talking to a wall. Eventually I go home because one of her friends she doesn't see much is coming over and wanted to spend time with her. When I got home, we spent hours talking about problems and by night, she said she wants time away to think. The next day she texts me about how she got drunk(she barely ever drinks) and how she had an amazing night at a party. So obviously we are broken up and her only reason is that i didn't talk to her enough. So basically we went from going to have sex for the first time to her completely moving on from me in one night. She said she'd still like to talk but whenever I would text her, its basically one word resposnes from her so I stopped texting her. Maybe I just got way to clingy with her in the first place?

So it's been 8 months since I lost my dream girl and I still think about her almost everyday. I've been on only a few dates with only girls since, they were great girls to but I just never felt it click with them. One last thing also is that masturbation seems to have lost its touch with me (haven't fapped in over 8 months). Has anyone gotten to the point were they think they lost the perfect person and now will just now be settling for second best, or just never gotten over a good relationship?

176842,Relationships,21t5o4,"Okay hey guys, I made this because I figured it'd be refreshing to get some different perspectives. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. 
We were each other's first loves, and we lost our virginity to each other.
When we first started dating it was definitely the honeymoon stage. We would talk every day, hang out every day. He would constantly call me beautiful. Constantly say he wanted to marry me. Constantly kiss me and hold my hand and flirt with me and do little things that really made me feel like he thought i was special. We were so sickeningly in love and this his lasted for an extremely long time, and we had occasional issues like any normal relationship, but we were in utter bliss.

LONG story short, we've broken up a couple of times due to long distance relationship issues when I went off to college, but we got back together. And when we got back together it was the same--super blissful, romantic. He always said sweet things, always did sweet things, would randomly tell me he loved me or I was beautiful or he couldn't wait to see me. Not ALL the time, but enough to really make me feel great. And I would do the same for him--that's the kind of relationship we had for the past two and a half years.

So he finally comes to college with me and we are together, and suddenly he's totally different. We fight all the time and break up once or twice. He is not the same affectionate person. He has stopped the random compliments and the random kisses. It is a GREAT day when he says anything positive towards me, and he treats me like a friend and nothing more even though we are dating.

However, each time we break up HE is the one who wants me back and asks me to be his girlfriend again. But then when we're together he is TOTALLY not the same affectionate person he once was. I've voiced this to him before in a calm and approachable way and he doesn't have much to say, just that he feels he's being fine and that he's stressed with school or I don't appreciate him.

I don't know what to do! I totally get that he's stressed with school but honestly his un-affection is SUCH a huge change from who he was before! And I know that he definitely wants me because he's repeatedly asked for me back when we've broken up, but whenever we actually GET back together he is stone cold and doesn't act affectionate like he used to. He rarely says I love you, rarely compliments me, rarely kisses me when he sees me. Whenever I say anything cute or complimentary he doesn't reciprocate (not that I need that but it would be nice once in a while). He wants to hang with his friends on the weekends and go to the club on Fridays when I know he definitely would have wanted to spend the day with me.

I know it sounds crazy and clingy, which is why I need a fresh perspective. I think the main problem is that I'm so USED to the person he was--the affectionate, over the top, loving boyfriend, that it's really throwing me off that he's not that way. I've always wanted to maintain a healthy balance in my relationships, where we could have our own separate lives and also a life together, but I've also been used to being nearly inseparable with this kid for years now so it's kind of hard that he's out of that phase and i'm not. I would like for him to maybe throw in a compliment or a kiss every ONCE in a while, but now it's rare that he's ever sweet, I honestly can't remember the last time he's said or done anything positive for me or even acted like he was happy to see me. He just isn't acting the same and I don't feel loved and I don't feel like he wants to be with me and yet he keeps asking for me back. I don't understand it and honestly I feel very crazy and clingy and that's the last thing I want to feel like :(.

I’m having some troubles with my current college roommates and am looking for some advice. It’s long, even one person reading this and responding would be great!


I [F21] am a junior in college and have three roommates Kate [21f], Mary [21F], and Irene [21F].Two sets of best friends: Kate and I, Mary and Irene. We decided to live together this past year and everything surprisingly went really well, we were all great friends and got along great until the end of the year.



Kate has had increasing anxiety since the beginning of college and has a very strong victim/baby/youngest sibling complex. As her anxiety has gotten worse, so have these tendencies, but she’s fairly high functioning. She averaged 2-3 “breakdowns” per month (i.e. crying for emotional reasons, not necessarily irrational, but provoked by the tiniest of things). As the school year went on, Kate’s anxiety got progressively worse. She has been seeing a therapist for a few years, but a few weeks before school ended she began taking a small dose of an anti-depressant/anxiety medication. This caused her anxiety and breakdowns to increase a very large amount. As many people have experienced, and seems to be her case, her anxiety is getting worse before it gets better. She cries 2-3 *a day* and her mood can change at the drop of a hat. 


The real problem is the shift in dynamic her new increased anxiety has created in our apartment. I say “real problem” because Kate is well on her way to getting her anxiety under control, and we are all trying to help in the best ways we can. She also is in constant contact with her therapist and doctor to make sure her medication and dosage is in her best interest. Kate’s anxiety was everyone’s number one priority, but it seems like every avenue of help is being taken by her. The main problem, which isn’t really being acknowledged by anyone except me and Irene, is the change in dynamic.


Mary has a very strong mother complex: she needs to be needed. As Kate’s anxiety and emotional needs have increased, Mary has decided to make Kate’s emotional life her responsibility. She constantly babies her (encouraging her to cry, spend the day anxiety ridden, etc…) anything that makes Kate need Mary more. They are both very enabling of each others behavior and have become a **very** exclusive friendship.  I also have a problem with the way Mary has been approaching and self-treating Kate’s anxiety, in that I think she is encouraging non-healthy behavior. 


I can’t even count how many times I’ve walked into our house and had them both freeze and stop talking or go in the other room. When we have friends over, they blatantly choose to leave the group and hang out in other rooms. It makes Irene and I, and in addition our entire friend group, very uncomfortable.   


The exclusivity made me uncomfortable, but it’s not entirely their fault. I am a *very* independent person and am an introvert. I understand when friendships change and grow apart so honestly, my problem is not that my best friend is spending more time with someone else. I have however, taken a large step back from the friendship Kate and I have since this developed. Its not that our friendship fell apart, its just not present anymore. (When we hang out alone everything is basically normal, but that never happens since she is always glued to Mary’s side, and vice versa). Irene is also very independent, and shares many of the same opinions as me about their friendship. 


The dynamic got so strange and uncomfortable that I decided to live at home for the summer. Irene went to study abroad for the summer, so I really didn’t want to third-wheel it all summer.


How do I approach the shift in friendship and roommate dynamic when I move back into the apartment in a month?

She breaks up with me every time she gets mad at me, almost 2 times a month. Literally for a few months she broke up with every week or so. It'd be 2-3 great days and then 4-5 days of trying to get her to talk to me again. All the while the name calling, saying she's with other guys, etc. 

Anyway, she broke up with me 2 months ago after our last run which was about 2 years. She cut me off and I tried getting in touch to talk many times. A few days later she said she's seeing someone else. A few days later she said shes sleeping with him, moving in with him, and pregnant. All the while telling me I'm pathetic, disgusting, pussy whipped, ugly, trash for trying to talk to her. 

She always lied about stuff before to get to me and played so many games I have no idea whats true/real. I asked and tried to talk to her and told her how much I care about her and all she does is yell at me and put me down and swear its all true. I said I can live with that but I have a hard time believing her and asked for proof, which she refuses. I have not been perfect along the way. I have lost it and hurt her back a few times, when we're both well beyond anything normal or healthy. She's stopped responding all together now. I'm struggling because after so long of all the abuse and manipulation and lies I don't know what is/was real. I care about her a lot and I'm just lost and messed up at this point.

Six or so months in he started back at uni, living in Halls, I started to feel that he was getting weird and something was going on. I then went on a snoop (I know I'm an evil bitch) and found explicit messages to a girl at uni, we'll call her Anne. He told me nothing happened, it was just messages and was a joke a week later they kissed. He told me about it a few days later and we broke up because he said he would hurt me again if we stayed together and I fucking hated him for doing that. 


A week or two later we got back together after spending a few nights together and talking it out. He assured me he wouldn't do it again and that he was panicked over the fact that we were good together and it felt serious to him. I told him it would take time and that I was bound to be scared and paranoid at times because of what happened. He said he understood this and that I could talk to him. 



Five months later and to be honest I'm quite happy, only problem is that he goes out a lot without me and I am so paranoid I can't contain the crazy. Literally, last night I went out and ended up texting him a barrage of abuse over him not giving a fuck and the fact that his Facebook status states he is single! I don't even give a damn about Facebook and my status doesn't show, I was just pissed cause it felt like another rejection to me. In addition when I try and talk to him about my craziness he gets angry and defensive, as if I should be okay.


This has, in my defense, been recently exacerbated by a mutual friend walking up to me in the student bar and loudly asking Do you have an STI, I was flummoxed and taken a back, I haven't made a name for myself like that. When I asked him what the hell he was talking about he told me has been sleeping with Anne who believes she has an STI that she could have given to my SO. I asked my SO about this as both he and Anne said they never had sex, they both still deny having sex and she said she was tested at the beginning of Jan and is clear. The lad who came and told me has also told me that I need to give him a call when me and my SO break up so we can get together. This all in all leads me to believe he is lying and logically it all makes sense but I still have this pit in my stomach I can't shake off. 



Never been in this position and hate feeling like I'm going to be hurt again. How do I calm my paranoia and explain to him how I feel without him taking offence? Or should I even bother?

I would like some perspective on this. I don't understand what's going on at all and want some input on what you would do or how you would handle this situation.

I fell for a friend of mine long distance. We haven't seen each other since 2011. Just as friends. After this hang out, we exchanged numbers and began talking very regularly. Early 2012, it becomes more than friends pretty much. We talk every day. He tells me how he doesn't want to be with anyone but me. We decide we want to meet and talk about where this is going. He offers I stay with him a few months (if I find work) to test out the waters so to speak. I thought this was a good idea. I could always go home.

This was planned for July. Before the trip, he decides to tell me that he was suffering from extreme depression and withdrawal symptoms from an anti-depressant he was on. I knew of his depression but did not know the severity of his condition. I told him I would wait as long as he kept me updated. I really fell for him and knew he was worth it.
Nothing ever came of this. He stopped Skyping, calling, texting. He is very busy with work/school but that's something he's always done. Always made time for me. So I assumed the depression was the base of why he was doing this.

I got an email from him this week telling me he wants to try again and talk in person. He is planning on going to see his friends and will be in the area. Wants to meet and discuss everything.

I was extremely hurt by this. Before, he pretty much told me that he wanted a real relationship. Cared for me immensely. All of these things. Like he offered me to stay with him. And now he wants to talk because he will already be in the area? He's acting so casual about all of this. I asked what he wanted. How serious he is. All he said was he needed time but wants to see me in a few months.

So, basically I would like your input. Why would someone string a girl along for this long? There are girls right near him. I'm very confused. Here's the thing. He's barely talking to me. He still goes out and carries on other relationships. I don't get it.

24130,Relationships,2lar29,"So, me and my boyfriend have been together for a little under two years and lately we have both been really stressed out because of a big assignment that is linked to a project. That means that most of our free time is spend working on that separately. We also don't live together. We see each other on a daily basis and while it does give us the chance to talk and spend time at lunch together, we never get to spend time alone.

Some background: my bf (let's call him John) has been a really shy guy when we first met. We were both 15 at the time and she was spending most of his time playing pc games or the guitar. You could say it was the first real relationship for both of us.

Things were great. Our relationship progressed, we were and still are really comfortable with each other and life was good. One thing that John wasn't comfortable with, was being affectionate in any situation were another person could be present. This means school, any public place and when being with friends. I guess it didn't bother me at that time because we had plenty of time where we were on our own and that made up for it. After some time he got a bit more comfortable and he became more comfortable with physical contact while friends were around, like being close to each other and stuff, also goodbye kisses and sometimes a bit of holding hands.

Back to the present: Until a few weeks ago it was still great i'd say. Our sex life was great, we spent time together and got along quite well. We barely had fights. Then the deadline to our projects got closer and closer and we both spend a two week break that we had basically at home doing our stuff. He was recording an album and i did two portraits, which is both quite time consuming. John barely answered my texts (i can understand that) but what really bothered me (especially after we were seeing each other again all the time) was that our conversations just got really dull. We always had quite good ones, I loved how funny he was and how we always had a great time together. But now it just got so...dull.

Our sex life also died down. It's mostly due to the fact that we don't have time to be alone. Which means there's barely any physical contact. There's no kiss in the morning, or hug. He doesn't touch me at all during the day and he doesn't initiate a goodbye kiss. It made me miserable and I tried talking to him (more than once) and he always answers that he doesn't do it on purpose he just doesn't know why it is like that. John also says that he just doesn't really think of it so he forgets to do it. When he told me that I was actually quite hurt and angry and I responded that this makes me feel rejected and it makes me feel weird when I always have to initiate any affection.

I tried to talk to him about this many times and it isn't really working because he just mumbles i don't know and similar things and it doesn't lead to anything.

So dear /r/relationship, do you have any advice on what I could do to make him talk to be about this issue or how to make it better in general? That'd be amazing. Thanks for any reply.

68966,Dating,2rbe78,"Buckle in, friends. This is my first post, and I have a lot to say...

So I've been trying my best to charm this angel since we were both teenagers. I obviously make her feel good about herself to keep around, but I've been living pretty centrally in the 'friend-zone' this whole time.

I still made my occasional, sometimes drunken, advances, but she always rejected with grace, and after the embarrassment faded, things would go back to normal.

This girl is sort of stunning, and her windows of being single are few and far between, and to complicate matters, when she does pick up a new boyfriend, she never mentions them in front of me, and usually I find out from another source why the latest stonewall on my advances is happening.

I have been a one-man emotional support group for this girl for quite some time, getting phone calls at all hours of her in tears (the sound and sight of which absolutely break my heart), almost all of them for very legitimate reasons, though. But then there are the times where she honestly expects me to tell her how to fix her current relationship with the new guy that isn't working out in hours long conversations.

For the first time in about 5 or so, she openly told me this time that she had a new boyfriend, which, easily detecting patterns, I had already figured and hadn't bothered trying to make a move in a while, though I was still very openly flirtatious, as I always have been around her.


We're kind of a bunch of lushes when we get together, and she, her roommate, and I often drink until we pass out. It being a small apartment, I typically shared my interest's bed, with only the idea of trying anything lurking in the back of my mind in these situations.

A couple of weeks ago, the night she was kind enough to let me know a new boyfriend existed, she told me later that I deserved to be her boyfriend randomly, and then went back to whatever she was doing while I tried to hear over the white noise flooding my brain.

I didn't think much would come of it. She'd had a few. No big deal. My brain was a bit too chaotic after that to keep drinking, suddenly no longer needing to dampen but sharpen it, I headed home for the night and skipped the 'sleepover'.

But then she said it again last week, granted, in a similar state, reached out and grabbed my hand until she noticed the roommate was right there, upon which she released it like a hot coal.

Last night (finally), neither of us drank as much as usual and stayed up into the wee hours of the morning doing our usual bit, before climbing into her bed at around 3am so as not to disturb the now sleeping roommate. The TV on, me only slightly noticing what it's saying or showing me, I can see that she's looking at me out of the corner of her eye in my periphery.

She jerked her eyes away as though she wasn't just looking at me, and while the hand may be faster than the eye, they eye is as fast as the eye, and we can all tell when anyone does the flick-the-eye-away thing when you get noticed looking at something. A minute later, she was doing it again. I pretended not to notice this time, and after a few seconds, she abruptly asked about my do's and don't of sex.

I was shocked. She was completely serious, and had never asked anything like that to me before. I joked at first, thinking she might have just been cruelly teasing me, but it turned into us lying there, looking into each other's eyes for hours, and talking exclusively about pretty much the last thing we hadn't talked about in our years long friendship.

And we laid there for a while, just looking taking the other's eyes and smiles in, until the sun came up many hours later.

I am massively torn here. This girl is not only physically attractive, but our friendship is also stable with some foundations that are getting quite deep. And as much as I would have liked to do something last night, I am aware she is still going out with her boyfriend, and while I don't know the guy, I am so hyper-against cheating that even if it's the girl of my dreams who I've been chasing for years, I can't stand the idea of that guy hearing about that or having it happen to him.

Sooo yeah. I haven't slept all night and my emotions are bouncing back and forth like a ping pong ball at about the same speed as my heart rate. If you read all that crazy mumbo-jumbo, thanks. I sorta just needed to get it off of my chest.

**The Long Story**
I'm (Bob) and my wife (Carol) has a very good friend (Alice), whose husband (Ted) was always a know-it-all and a grouch.  We went to 5-6 of these evening concerts, and it was not my favorite because I was always stuck talking to Ted, but sometimes you take one for the marriage.

Then Alice introduced me to a group who could possibly use my business services.  Ted kept calling me up and talking about things like, ""if we're going to be partners on this thing,"" and ""we have to think like partners,"" etc.  Every time I shot him down, and said that I was going it alone, and he could do as he wanted, as well.  I was clear to the point of rudeness.  I wouldn't partner with Ted in baking cookies, just because he's unpleasant and bossy.  He also knows zero about getting this done.

So, we go to a meeting about this project, and I find out that somehow, we would be splitting any fees 50/50%.  I state clearly that I won't do that, and that Bob and Ted should be considered independent agents.  Everyone is in agreement.

We left the meeting and Ted put his hand on my shoulder, really around my neck and pulls me so close to him that his nasty breath is in my face, and tells me, ""you're going to pay me a fee if you don't want to be partners.""  I step away, and tell him no, and that we explicitly did NOT have any partnership.  He says that a gentleman would.  I said that I would think about it (I didn't want to upset Carol and Alice's friendship by saying anything precipitous).

I told all this to my wife, and she agreed that he was an entitled, know-it-all bully, and agreed that I didn't have to ever see Ted.  But she would still be friend's with Alice.  OK.

I've lost about 40 pounds all while my sister has been dealing with/now recovering from anorexia. My mom is very paranoid about our eating habits, but, when I was heavier, would openly mention how fat I was, even in front of my sister when she was still dealing with her ED. 

Now I constantly get asked if I'm eating and why I go to the gym so often, with concerns of a potential eating disorder. I lift (squats, deadlifts, etc) and some cardio (mostly following the Starting Strength routine for strength gaining) and watch what I eat but I sometimes get lazy (I only have classes 2x/week so sometimes I wake up late and end up missing breakfast) with food. 

I don't see myself as fat anymore. I don't have an eating disorder and it's crazy to think that 139 at 5'4 is concerning (though I *humbly* will say that I carry my weight very well).

It seems like my sister gets triggered every time she sees me (we go to the same college) and she recently called my mom saying she's concerned about me (when we saw each other just yesterday she commented on how thin I look and how I've lost my cheeks, etc). Coincidentally, I had sent my mom a picture of me in a little black dress that showed off my progress and that concerned her, too. 

I'm frustrated and scared about how I'm triggering my sister; her ED issues previously led to me being diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression. I don't want her going back to where she was before and don't want to go back to such a dark period in my own life. 

I don't know what to do to convince them that I'm ok and to make sure my sister doesn't see this as what she dealt with before, resulting in triggers every time she sees me. 

I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning: I live with my boyfriend who lifts with me and we eat the same meals (though he supplements with addtl protein). Not him nor anyone else I hang out with have mentioned any concerns. I seriously think my family is just traumatized from my sister's situation and anything weight loss related is just triggering. 

Edit: Another thing to note about my family: my brother is seriously overweight (he's a pre-teen) and it seems like my weight loss journey is more concerning to my family than my brother's obesity. Just to show how wildly skewed my family's ideas on weight are.

I have been slowly chatting and talking with a (24/M) for almost 2 months now. I’ll call him Charles, and for me, call me Christy.  At first, we mainly spoke via text or whenever we ran into each other at a show and things seemed to be going great between us.  Good chemistry, same interests and all that jazz.  But, as we continued to hang out, things have been getting more complex.  The more that I hang out with him in person, the more I see how depressed Charles really is and it’s heart breaking, especially since he’s a very sweet and generous guy to be with.  But, over this entire period of time of getting to know each other, I noticed that Charles has recently been really dodgy and would cancel plans to hang with me. 



 So, this weekend, we were just cuddling and kissing after watching a movie together,  nothing too crazy, when he stopped and turned away.  I finally had enough and had the courage to ask why he was so hesitant, and why he was avoiding me….  And, I finally got my answer.  He’s been cheated on and hurt in a past relationship, and is being extremely cautious with me and wants to take it slow.  Plus, he was honest enough to let me know that he has a STD….  In all honesty, I really appreciated that he came forward like that.  I know that was hard to do.... But…. because he came out to me like that and trusted me, I knew that I couldn’t keep any big secrets about myself from him either...  



I normally keep my emotions and problems bottled up, or speak about certain things with some of my closest friends.  But..., he needed to know.  And Reddit, I guess you should know too.



So... the next day, I got in contact with Charles and asked if we could hang out, and he said sure... and when I got there, I was completely honest with him.  I've been cheated on in life, but in a harsher way.  I was molested as a child, raped last year, and contracted an STD from the rape....  and, I don't think he knew how to react.  I don't think anyone could know how to react to a claim such as that and it's why I haven't really told anyone... but, he did hug me and comfort me...  we also hung out for a short while before I went home. 



Now... I'm afraid that I may have chased him away by telling him the truth.  Especially since the last guy I was dating a few months back dumped me the next day after I told him this.....  Now, I think Charles will do so too and I'm extremely upset by this.  Do I stand a chance with Charles or should I just accept the fact that he may not want me anymore...

One is that his sex drive is higher than mine currently, although I think this may be a temporary thing due to hormonal changes and being on birth control.  I am seeing a new endocrinologist who has me on a couple other meds and we are figuring out my levels and it's been a strange adjustment period.  


I actually LIKE his high sex drive.  One of the things the drove my last serious BF and I apart was his LOW sex drive where I felt I was getting turned down for sex, so the fact that that never happens now has me feeling very fortunate.  My experience with my ex also makes me sympathetic to my current BF's needs and I try to be as open to sex as possible and only deny him in the most EXTREME cases.  I can probably count on one hand the number of times I have flat out said ""No"", and we have sex at least once a day.


Over the holidays, I was working while he had a lot of time off so I was exhausted while he was rested and ready to have sex at a moment's notice.  I found it harder and harder to be up for it, so one thing I suggested to him, is that if I wasn't feeling it right away, it might help if he rubbed my back a little to get me in the mood instead of other foreplay stuff.  He happily obliged and has been doing that sometimes when I am too exhausted to jump at the chance for sex.


This past Friday (the 13th), we were at home hanging out, and we smoked a little MJ, which is something I also am not completely on board with (don't think it should be illegal, just that I had a bad experience with it 2 years ago and I just don't particularly enjoy being around people who are high), but I try to partake in it about once a month with my BF as a way to bond over something he enjoys.  Unfortunately, the trend has been that this substance makes him incredibly horny while it makes me incredibly sleepy.  


So we smoked, and then got caught up watching part of a movie, and then went to bed at nearly 2am, MUCH later than usual for us (and he had to work the next day).  So we're in bed, and he starts rubbing my back, and I know it's because he wants to have sex, so I start saying things like, ""Don't you think it's a little too late for that?"",  ""I really think it's too late?"",  ""It's soo late"", but I don't owtwardly say no.  Somewhere along the lines of the massage, I fall asleep on my side, and the next thing I know, I wake up and my boyfriend has ENTERED me, and is now FUCKING me while I am COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.  I was horrified in that moment about what was going on.  We had never had sex in that position before where he was on top of me while I was on my side, and my legs were locked down by him.  I didn't movie.  I just pretended to go back to sleep and hoped it would stop.  It went on for several more minutes.  Finally he gave up without finishing and went to sleep.  


I don't know what to make of this.  Did my boyfriend sexually assault me?  Was I not clear enough in saying no?  What does it say about him and our sexuality that he can get on top of me and fuck a nonresponsive girlfriend for several minutes?  On the other hand, it's not like it was violent.  He claims it was an honest mistake of him trying to get me in the mood and him taking it too far.  I really haven't gotten ANY weird, creepy, abusive vibes from this guy after being around him CONSTANTLY for a year, but I wanted to throw this out to the Reddit community to see what they had to say.  He has also agreed to go to couples and/or individual counseling sessions with me this week, but we do not have an appointment booked yet.

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I went to bed lightly under the influence, he was horny, I was tired.  I said it was late, he tried rubbing my back to get me in the mood.  I fell asleep during the massage, and when I awoke, boyfriend had entered me and was now fucking me for an indeterminate amount of time.  I pretended to stay asleep, fucking continued for a few more minutes until he gave up (did not finish).  Do not know if this was a simple misunderstanding or if he's a monster.","Me [31 F] with my boyfriend [29 M] of 11 months, not sure if he sexually assaulted me, what to think, or where to go from here",0.0,False,43.0,128.0,1424291165.0,/r/relationships/comments/2wclhx/me_31_f_with_my_boyfriend_29_m_of_11_months_not/,Romantic
16465,Relationships,1reon1,"I met N through co-workers when I was looking for a room to rent. I moved in last February. We hit it off and talked for hours together every night. Shortly afterwards, he started work at the same place as myself. We hooked up a few weeks after living together. It was lovely and had all the magic of a new relationship: lots of communication, sex, and general good vibes. We discussed the idea of a more serious relationship about six weeks in.  

---

He told me that he disliked the typical monogamous sort of relationship. He felt that a person’s love can be limitless and it’s unrealistic to keep it to one person. I was very hesitant but thought that I could try things and see where they led us. 

---

One week later, as I was getting ready to attend a friend’s wedding, he told me that he was “together” with his female friend, D. I suspected that he had feelings for her but was not ready for this new relationship. His descriptions of time spent with D made me feel like she was somewhat manipulative. On one occasion, she had invited him over so he could help her with a project, but she would spend that time talking to her other friends in the house in another language and essentially ignored him. 

---

I was devastated. I had a rotten time at the wedding because I was so distracted. I left early to talk with him; he agreed to slow things down with D. He finally broke off that relationship a couple of weeks later. However, he was very upset that I had that sort of control over his affairs. I struggled with that feeling for a month or two before I broke down. I said that I can’t determine who he does and does not love, and would just have to deal with his future relationships.

---

That was about five months ago. Things have been very turbulent in that time. I think I have fits of crying about once a week due to our arguments. Some of the key fights have been regarding: his texting hearts to female friends (such as D) though he doesn’t do that for me; my being jealous of his obvious excitement to see female co-workers; my “unrealistic expectations” of liking time alone with him outside of his planning projects for his house. He has had the tendency to obsess over his construction projects and they are usually his preferred topic of conversation. He says that that’s how he likes to make me feel important: by including me in his interests. But usually, it culminates in his asking my advice on things I don’t understand, and his impatience because I don’t have answers.

---

His interest in sex dwindled rapidly. I was the one to initiate sex and could succeed about once a week. When I asked about it, he told me that he just isn’t interested in the physical aspect of relationships and preferred intellectual exchanges. It was difficult for me to accept, but I tried to engage him in more discussions. I don’t think it made a difference.

---

After feeling unwanted for months, I complained to a close friend that I just wanted to go on a date. I wanted to feel special and interesting to someone. Days later, I hit it off really well at a party with a mutual friend and the host, F. I confided in him about the trouble I had in my relationship. He seemed very understanding. I had to work early the next morning and was already in the same neighborhood as work, so I decided to spend the night. N (as I see it) overstayed his welcome at the party and talked for hours with a woman about gardening even after everyone else had left. I was able to get to bed at about four or five in the morning. Before falling asleep, F visited me and just held me for a few minutes before leaving again. 

---

I met F for coffee a couple of days later. He asked what my relationship status was, and I explained that N and I were “together-ish”… Together but open. F was unsure about stepping into a relationship like that, but was interested so we agreed to go on a date. It went really well. Days later, though, he told me he was recovering from a recent break-up so wouldn’t be dating for a while. His last lover, M, had a husband and was keeping their affair under wraps. He still had strong feelings for her and was blindsided by her breaking things off before leaving for a trip to Europe. She was difficult to get a hold of and didn’t seem to want to talk to him.

---

N and M are close friends. I learned from N that M got back from Europe a little while ago and already had a new boyfriend living with her and her husband. I felt pretty bad for F when I heard.

---

I broke things off with N just after my date with F. I realized that I was just settling for someone who wasn’t able (or didn’t want) to be physically or emotionally intimate, and was only motivated by things he felt were “necessary”. I have been trying to heal for a few weeks now, though I feel pretty confident that I made the right decision. I’m still very irritable and depressed. It looks as though N doesn’t seem fazed by it; he’s just gone on acting as though nothing ever happened. One day before leaving for work he told me he loved me in a very nonchalant way.

---

Last night, I was feeling particularly stressed about the breakup and work and life in general. He held me for a while and we ended up dozing off. Shortly afterward, though, he kissed me on the cheek and began kissing my neck. Things escalated and we ended up having sex. (I was so surprised that even then, he initiated it)  He said that he still loves and cares for me and I burst into tears. The experience was incredibly confusing and emotional. He held me for a while longer before telling me he was going to bed. 

---

This morning, he came into my room to see how I was doing. We hugged and chatted for a few minutes. He looked at me with a pensive look on his face. When I asked him what he was thinking, he replied, “nothing”. I thought it was weird, so asked him again. He lost his patience and said that he didn’t have to be thinking anything important, and besides, he didn’t have to tell me anyways. He left the house minutes later and slammed the door.

---

His friend M came over tonight. They bought bottles of wine and he cooked dinner. They went to his room and shut the door. I could hear them talking from my room. I felt dejected to be left out like that. Later, when I went to use the bathroom beside his bedroom, I found the door locked even though no one was using it. Since his bedroom shares a door with the bathroom, I knocked on his door and asked if he could let me in. I heard whispers and giggles before he opened the door. He leaned out the doorway, keeping the door mostly shut behind him. I went to the bathroom and heard them kissing. I became so upset that I went back to his room and opened the door. I told M that she should leave; N and I had to talk.

---

I understand that by doing that, I violated their privacy. But I couldn’t stand that situation. N had just told me that he has feelings for me, then we had a fight that we never resolved, then he was just getting intimate with someone in the room across the hall. After M left, he came back to tell me he never wants to get back together. To him, my attempts to control his life are inexcusable. He says he may consider being my friend in the future, but does not guarantee that he can trust me.

---

I wonder if any of his actions tonight were because of the wine or even if that matters (it probably doesn’t). I have just made plans to visit a friend tomorrow afternoon. I should be able to explain things to my friend and ask if I can sleep on their couch for one or more nights. I have also e-mailed a manager at work asking if the schedule can be rearranged so that N and I work together as little as possible. Fortunately, we work in different departments so we don’t share the same workspace. 

---

**TL;DR** - Roommate / co-worker / partner feels as though I'm too demanding. I feel like I don't get anything emotionally significant from him. I've broken up with him but feel like I'm being played. Just found him getting intimate with a friend after an emotional rollercoaster.


So there it is. I know that this just reaffirms my decision to break things off with him, but I feel so betrayed and used. Internet, I ask you: What can I take away from this rotten experience? How can I help myself heal?

I told him and it ended up somewhat okay. He told me he didn't consider it cheating and will give me another chance. After talking about it he told me he was mad but willing to forgive me since It seemed to him that I felt very sorry for it.

When I first met her, I wasn't super into her but she had everything on my ""list"" that I thought a girl should have (educated, good head on her shoulders, etc.). We ended up finally getting together. It worked out really well. She had a great family, that loved me. My family loved her. I had it made (her family had a good amount of money). Her problem was 1. She had been sheltered all her life. She wasn't at all street smart. She didn't even know how to pay bills. 2. Boring sex life. She didn't get any pleasure out of sex. I'm very sexual. 3. She was stuck up her family's ass. It would never be just me and her, it would be me and her family. 4. She was catholic, and I just didn't think that domination was right for me (No offense to anyone, it just wasn't for me). 

**Why my SO and I have had problems:** My SO and I have dated for around 4 months. When I met her, she was this beautiful, intelligent, indepedent girl that had all the qualities that my ex never had. She had somewhat of a rougher upbringing like me, and I feel like she could handle some of my family life that comes into play sometimes. She was also very sexual and I loved that. Her big problem was that when she met me she was still hooking up with her ex when she met me, and it didnt stop when we started dating. She did eventually stop, when it all came crashing down. I think she finally learned that I was exactly what she wanted and she needed to get serious about me. When she finally decided to change for the good and realize I'm exactly what she wanted, I hit my breaking point. I'm at the point now where I don't even want to try anymore.

in february i broke up with my boyfriend after a very long relationship. we had good times and bad times though during the last years the bad did overshadow all the good. 
fact is that we didnt have sex for over a year and we were living together like roommates. i had no more desire for him and it felt even weird to touch him. everyone lived his own life though we shared a flat and a bed. occasionally we would watch a series together, but that was about it.

in january i met another men and fell in love instantly. he made me laugh again and gave me motivation to change many things in my life that i felt was stuck since two years.
we started a relationship end of february, hence i broke up with my ex. i felt all the time that it was the right decision and developed already very strong feelings for the new guy (additionally we have really great sex. as great as i never had with my ex). but now that i'm about to move out in two weeks i suddently started to have feelings for my ex again. i don't know if its love or empathy or being just supersad about things not working out. all i know is that i could constantly cry. i am really in love with the other guy but imagining that my ex is out of my life is unbearable. my ex also still has hope i might change my mind and says that he wants me back.

our relationship started not ideally as i was very young and he already had a lot of experience. during the first years i felt like i was the one investing more and loving more than he did. i felt that i constantly need to please him. that changed slowly but i guess it didn't allow me to be myself and do all the things i wanted to do (f.e. i would rather stay home with him than go out cause he wouldn't wanna go out ever). in the last years i  realized that i wasted a lot of my youth and started meeting friends again, going out, having fun whilst my ex stayed at home alone. during our relationship he gave up nearly all his friendships due to being ""too tired"" from work. he got more and more unattractive for me and our everyday life grew us apart. sometimes when we went to sleep and he switched of the lights i lay in bed thinking ""so this is gonna be my future now?"" and felt pure panic and fear.

but when we actually spend time together we have a lot of fun, we share the same humour, love the same music, movies and art and i really admire him as a nice human being. i dont know why my feelings changed and i can't say if maybe our everyday life is to blame and we could be great partners if that would be different. 
but now it's kinda late as i already have a new partner who i really don't want to give up. but at the same point i feel like i can't let go.
i was thinking about a breakup since over a year before i even met the new guy. but now i am afraid to make a big mistake. i just don't know how to figure out what choice is right.

I am also aware this may seem to be a juvenile issue to some, alas, I have feels.

the context: 

we got on the topic of past dating, and he starts to ask a question, ""Am I the.. oh never mind"" 

I press for him to finish the sentence for a bit, finally he does. 
""I was going to ask if I am the best looking person you've dated, but it's a dumb, silly and vain question so forget it."" 

I realize he only didn't ask because he knew I'd ask him the same question, so I call him on it. He denies that a few times before following it up with this gold: 

""fine, she was really stupid though! you're so much cooler! you're awesome.. etc.. etc"" 

I honestly can't even remember what else he said after that because I felt like I was suddenly slapped in the face. Basically, it made me feel pathetic that he hurt my feelings and then followed it up with compliments.

I ended up explaining to him that I didn't need him to put down someone else to make me feel better. That, in my opinion, relationships are about making someone feel great, feel the best and at this time, he is the most attractive guy to me. I feel I should be to him. 

So basically, I can't seem to let this go. I am worried it's a warning sign that he is insensitive, let it be unintentional or not. Or he may start making me feel insecure since that seems to be happening already.

8433,Breakups,1kf4dz,"Hey reddit. I've been with my boyfriend about a year, he's always had issues with depression, I've known him around 4years. Sorry for the wall of text.


We spent around 4months casually hooking up. I wanted it to work for a while, he didn't and told me so all the time. We weren't coupley at all, we never cuddled or told each other we missed each other, we never even talked all that much, I concluded after a while that friends with benefits was all it was ever going to be. 


About 5months in, he told me he loved me out of the blue when he was drunk. This surprised me and after about a week I confronted him about it, explained why it had surprised me and that I didn't think I felt the same. I told him how I thought things were, and that I was happy with how things were. I didn't want anything hugely serious, and didn't think he did either. I've always had plans to move state which im saving for at the moment, and explained to him it's something I've always wanted to do alone. Things weren't bad between us, it just didn't feel like true love and 5months in I felt I would know if it was or not. He took it badly at 1st but quickly changed his tune and said we have a good time and that's all that matters. 


I think this is where I fucked up and let things get to the stage they are at now. I didn't realize just how depressed he was, and how much I'd been helping him out his shell. To me he just wasn't interested, but looking back it was just that he was ill. After being honest with him about how I felt, I continued to see him. I care for him alot, we have alot of history, we have great sex and we get on well. I might not be madly in love with him but we connect as people, and we have a good time together. Why ruin a good thing because of a few silly words? 


We kept hanging out. Whenever we hang out I talk, he listens. I talk to the point of complete frustration that he has nothing to say, I end up just firing question after question to try and find a subject he has more than one word to say on. This usually ends in me just giving up and we sit in silence. There is the odd day where he's truely himself, truly happy and I suppose that was why it's lasted this long. Underneath his depression he is a lovely guy, you just don't see him very often. I've tried everything I can think of to help him get better, and when I look back to how he was a few years ago I have helped him. In reality though, I probably shouldn't have knowing I couldn't stay with him forever. I guess in my naivety I never even considered forever, or when I did I imagined one day he would suddenly get better and would turn into all my expectations. 

 
His depression never really got better. He's always been a heavy drinker but usually with me around he wouldn't need to. Recently he's been drinking more. I've had to babysit him more times than I can remember, I've found him passed out on toilets with his pants round his ankles many times, I've had to wake him and get him home when he's fallen asleep at his friends wedding, I missed work because he got so drunk the night before he couldn't drive, I visited friends the other state over with him that I had not seen in months and by 4pm he was nearly asleep in the bar we were in because he was so drunk. He's not a violent drunk, he couldn't harm a fly if he tried but being left to deal with a 6ft dead weight when your trying to have a good night with friends isn't fun. I'm now at a stage where I get worried every time we get invited anywhere alcohol will be involved. 


The main glaringly obvious problem though, is that I'm not in love with him. I love him to death, he is one of my best friends and I would do anything to help him, but I don't get butterflies when I think about him. I don't pine for him on lonely nights. He's always said he doesn't either and that my definition of love is skewed, which is one of the reasons we've continually stayed together, but I feel I've let it drag on so long that I'm going to hurt him beyond repair. He doesn't let many people in, I'm one of the few. If I leave him, who will he have? Who will make sure he's ok when he feels like his world has just been completely pulled from all around him? I had my heart broken badly a few years ago and I would never wish that pain on anyone my personality is forever changed from what happened to me. Thinking of how badly he will take this is breaking my heart and I feel like a horrible, selfish human being for getting together with him in the 1st place. I've been pushing all this to the back of my mind for so long that I feel like I'm about to explode, I'm constantly angry and annoyed at him and it's because I feel so trapped, helpless and ashamed of letting things get this far.

I asked him if he was cool with it, and he said he didn't mind it. Only now I come to think about a talk we had on the subject way back. Essentially we agreed that it was one of those questions that you had to say yes to, otherwise you'd seem like a close-minded, bad friend, who is stuck in the past. Furthermore, I realize that I asked him at a party,right next to his new girl. I texted him about it too, where I got the same response, but I know for a fact that she reads his texts.

I think of this now, after having spent a weekend at her place on our first date.

35283,Breakups,1qozmd,"First ever post...please bear with me.  Background information:  I met B online through a bizarre social experiment my friends and i designed to score me a date to a George Strait concert.  We placed an ad to go on a date with me, no strings attached.  We placed the ad on various media outlets and asked guys to respond with an email saying why we should pick them.

.

Well, B sends in an email.  I respond.  The rest is history.  We talked online for over a month and met in person, officially, at the end of March.  Things are awesome.  I start to fall for him even more...and vice versa.  Keep in mind, he is a contract civilian overseas working a 30 day here/there rotation.  He is also divorced, 2 small kids, and a crazy lazy ex-wife.
.



Things get better:  I'm a very laid back person when it comes to relationships.  I was crazy supportive of his life and we worked around his schedule (work, kids, etc.).  

.

Fast forward to mid October:  He TEXTS me while he's overseas (yes, he can call, we talk all the time) and says he hates to do this but he needs to focus on his kids and he doesn't have time to be with me and be with them.  It's killing him, blah blah blah, he still loves me, blah, blah, blah.  So the next 2 weeks go by just like nothing is changed.  We communicate all day everyday just like we have been for the last 7-8 months.  He flies back and i see him for a little over and hour and he leaves to go have lunch with his kids at their school.  

.

He's been home for 3 weeks now and i haven't seen him since i picked him up at the airport.  So if you don't count the 1.5 hours he was at my house, i haven't physically been around him in 8 weeks due to this rotation.

.

He did a 180 and it's like pulling teeth to even get him to text me back.  Literally, it's like a light switch to night and day of what we had.  He tells me that he's sorry all the time.  He just needs time.  He needs a friend.  yet, he's not being a friend to me.  I won't hear from him for a couple days.  He won't come get his stuff that is still at my house.

.

and now, he told me at the beginning of the week that he quit his job.  I think he is self-destructing.  He's doing intentional things to make his life harder than what it has to be.  When we were together, it was so good.  We didn't fight.  We are really compatible.

.

I'm not making contact with him and haven't talked in a couple of days.  He knows i'm here for him and want to be his support.  He's breaking my heart.  the last time i spoke to him, i told him that he is actively choosing to do this alone and he doesn't have to.

What do i do?  Cut him loose and run like the wind?  Just let him come to me?  (i also need his stuff out of my house.)

A recent trip and talks with friends made me realize I need to put my foot down. They have all seen it and would like us to resolve it. I have bad health issues and can't deal with her constant wrath on top of it. We have talks about the same thing every few days: She wants the house clean and takes it as a personal attack when I leave something out, I am mostly too ill to do any chores and forgetful but would love to be able to clean. 


She came in and wanted to talk. I told her I don't think I can talk to her until she is able to keep her cool and speak in a problem solving manner without giving attitude and yelling in my face unnecessarily...she started with attitude and ended with yelling. I told her she can come talk to me when she's calm but if she's going to yell she can leave. She started screaming. I just kept calmly repeating that if she's going to yell she can leave. She screamed ""you're ruining my life!"" And ran to her room. My sister and I are 21 years old.

137530,Relationships,2fscts,"Ok so my bf and I have lived together for 2+ years. From the start I asked him to at the very least, store obvious things from his exes away in our/his storage room in the basement, if not throw them away. Things like clothes, underwear, hair (yes, he has hair from an ex 30yrs ago in bags in his home office), pictures, etc... From various different ex's and fuckbuddies.

He agreed to do so, on numerous occasions. I've brought specific items up a handful of times each year, calmly. His typical reaction is to scoff or laugh irritatedly, brush me off, and/or call me jealous and tell me how unappealing jealousy is.

Tonight after a house guest asked about his mousepad in his home office (picture of a girl in a miniskirt and tight top, pulling the skirt up on one leg and drinking milk/posing suggestively), which has been there nearly the whole 2years I've lived here, he admitted the girl in the photo is one of his ex's (later he said was actually just a fuckbuddy). I never minded the mousepad before. But finding out the picture on the mousepad is an ex? Yes that bothered me. 

My reaction was quite calmly (though a tad irritated of course) something along the lines of ""Seriously? It's time for a new mousepad."" I then took the mousepad and placed it in the trash. He told me he still needed to use it until he got a new one. Fine. I took it out of the trash and handed it back to him and ordered a new one from Amazon.

He then started on telling me how I need to get over my ""severe jealousy issues"". I asked, ""If I am so jealous, how come I didn't mind the mousepad before I knew the picture on it was of an ex?"".
He then defensively asked what the difference with it was now VS before I knew it was an ex of his on it. ""Furthering"" his argument about me being unreasonably jealous because I only minded it because it has an ex on it.

I let those comments brew for a bit, shortly turning to me raising my voice and at a few times screaming/yelling about how he hasn't stored any of the numerous items which he agreed he would and I've pointed out to him calmly on several different occasions over the years, and told him that he doesn't stick to his word. I also asked him why he never told me who that was on the mousepad because I myself had asked about it before and recieved only a half truth that had zero mention of the fact that the picture was an ex of his. His answer to the question was ""Because I knew you'd probably react like this!"" (aka, have a problem with it). So I ask why he put it out in the first place if he thought I'd have a problem with it/told him he doesn't consider what his partner (me) feels/that he'd rather keep out a picture of an ex fuckbuddy and feel totally fine about it, as long as I don't know who the picture is of.

He wen't on about how it's his house that I moved in to and that it takes time to do things, that they're such small things to him that he has continually forgot them over the years, and that THOSE reasons are proof that I don't consider HIM. (reminder, I've pointed them out to him about once every few months over the passed two years and until tonight never blew up about the fact that he hasn't removed any of them from our living area).

I told him 2 years is more than enough time to have taken the few minutes to either store these things or trash them.

To avoid making a long story even longer, he claimed several times throughout this, that I ""have serious issues"" which he says he seriously thinks I need counselling for. Severe jealousy issues.

I don't think I am in the wrong at all.
But maybe I'm biased (though I doubt it) so I wanted to consult you r/relationships viewers and find out what everyone else thinks? 
Am I in the wrong here?

87237,Breakups,2c846p,"So I've been out of this relationship for a while. I ran into an old letter from her where she says that as she wrote it that she was in near tears at how well I treat her and her son (age 10). I got to thinking of her and the break up, I don't know why I'm doing this, its over, but I've always wanted to ask and get someone's opinion about her. I don't expect a pity party, heck its so long and a wall of text, I doubt anyone would read this or care its so boring. But anyway, I've always wanted to ask, did she show signs of an abuser? Or was it manipulation? Or was I just too big of a wuss or sensitive?


Lets start by saying when I was in high school about a month after I turned 16 I was bench pressing 315lbs. I lost a lot of strength due to injuries and now, she is physically bigger than me by about 60 lbs, she was a college athlete and is thus stronger than me. It was made very clear due to her training as a Deputy Police Officer she could whip me in any kind of encounter. She would tell me stories about how she had to take such and such down to the ground at work, or break up fights. It would be safe to say she's been in a lot more scuffles in her life than I have and I played high school football and wrestled. But that aside, people would see us together and say there was something special about the two of us together. Strangers would apparently notice us and ask how it was we could talk for so long? When all we were doing was our usual talks and laughing.


Some examples of her abuse in our relationship.


On a few occasions she did manhandle me. Once she did something to my arm like something hurt for a moment in a shoulder and now I have a torn rotator cuff which for reasons I won't go into is inoperable and a permanent injury. I did not think at the time it was malicious, and I didn't find out about the extent until a while later after we had broken up. 


Once she put handcuffs on me (not in the fun kind of way) so I'd know how what it felt like.


Her son had a habit of hitting me. I didn't appreciate it, and asked him many times to stop. I asked her to back me up, and she tried a few times and gave up saying I should just take it. To which I tried to get her to understand that such behavior is unacceptable not only to me, but in society in general. She disagreed.


There were numerous occasions she would try and manipulate me and guilt me into doing something I didn't want to. Like out of the blue, telling me to skip work in the middle of a week, to take her and her kid to Reno for 3-4 nights. When I said no, she'd throw a fit about how she deserved it.


The last straw came one night, when we were playing a board game with her son, and he decided it would be funny to start kicking me. Not the type as in to leave a bruise. I was frustrated and asked him politely to stop. He laughed. She laughed and started kicking me too. Something happened in that moment, I really and seriously did not like the look in her eye which was coming out of the blue. I had a bad feeling in my stomach from that look, so I politely got up, said good night and walked out.


She came to me the next night to talk about it and said she had no idea that I didn't like to be hit and she thought it was funny to kick me. I asked how she could think that after months of my trying to get her and her son to stop hitting me. It then turned into an hour long conversation about her feelings. How I should read whatever relationship book because she deserves more. I read the book and asked her to talk about it, we never did.


I talked to my friends who know her, all but one said that I was being too rash, it was no big deal, that in relationships you can be right or you can be happy. I'm close to my mother and got her take and she also took my side saying that their behavior was inappropriate. 


It became moot because, she stopped talking to me. I found out a week or two later about the extent of the injury to my shoulder and I wrote her making very clear it wasn't a play or a game that I was really injured, no response, not even an I'm sorry. So that kinda cemented that we were done.


Then about a month later my best friend's wife calls me (whom didn't know my side of the story as I felt it best to not disparage her). She goes on to explained that the ex was at her house crying about how well I treated her and how she missed me. The wife told me if I care for her and want a relationship I should go over to her house right now with flowers and apologize, because if I ever wanted to be happy again, I had to. All I could think of was, apologize for what? For having a feeling of worth and walking away from a situation I didn't like? For getting injured by her treatment? For not wanting to be manipulated anymore? Honestly I was scared of that look in her eye, and didn't think apologizing would do any good. Needless to say I didn't go over.


I ran into her and her son a few months ago at a store. Her son saw me, yelled my name with excitement and ran to me, gave me a tackle / bear hug. He was so excited and started telling me about his baseball season and all sorts of stuff. She came up to me real timid and was near tears and I did give her a smile and hug. I could tell they wanted to talk more but instead I just politely said after a few mins, well its been great to see you two again, I get a feeling you have a lot of shopping to do and I've got to run. Hugged it out and I got out of there.


Despite all that I wouldn't say she's a bad person. Perhaps I'm too sensitive? Honestly I don't have much dating experience or have ever been in a serious relationship. Perhaps it was me? Perhaps I was too sensitive and the injury was just an accident. I don't know. Again I don't think anyone would actually read this, it was boring and pointless. If you did, you're a saint and a better person than me. Yes I know its moot because its in the past, but if anyone did read it, I'd like an opinion, was she showing signs of an abuser, or manipulative? Did I dodge a bullet?

78114,Infidelity,2ikr2z,"Sooo this might get a little complicated and long. I'll add fake names to help. In this situation there is me (23F), my boyfriend (25M) henceforth named Mark, his best friend (25F) I'll call Mary, and her Boyfriend (25M) called Paul. 

OK so...I have been part of this friend group for the past... 4 or so years that included Mary (the cornerstone, she is the one who decides who stays and who goes, its her and my BF's apt we all hang out in.), Paul (Tends to decide or gives ideas on what we should do while hanging out and is the current DM for a D&amp;D game we are playing through), Mark (laid back goes with the flow friend), me, and two other regulars. 

I was first friends with Mark but eventually through the intervention of David bowie (don't ask, its a weird joke) we started dating. Mark and I have been dating for a year and a bit. Its been a fabulous relationship, only negative was I sometimes missed having a Dom/Sub relationship that I know Mark can't provide. 

So a couple weeks ago I began hanging out one on one with Paul, Mary's boyfriend. I didn't think anything of it at first because Paul stuck by my side as a friend when Mary decided that I was somehow a threat to their relationship back in the first year of our friendship despite me clearly stating I did not find Paul attractive (NOTE: still not attracted to Paul). 

At this point I would like to note. Paul kissed a girl before I knew them and danced with her while they were supposedly on break. Mary freaked the fuck out left college to come back home, and she has terrible self confidence, and now has a controlling nature because of it. There are only one other female in our group besides her and I because of it and she only pops in and out occasionally. Their communication is terrible, constant passive aggressive tones and/or yelling claiming it to be 'just how they talk'. Paul stopped having sex with her over a year ago, and she is constantly telling my BF and I about the same shitty things in their relationship over and over again. 

Paul is a Dom and I knew that, and I'm a sub. It started as him just giving me advice and then we started talking about boundaries we should have... I said no to sex/blow jobs etc. We ended up watching porn together (like a week ago) and he pulled my hair and it rolled into him choking me, and I called him Master a couple times. I also messaged him as a sub during masterbation to ask permission to cum.

I thought I was okay with this, thinking what harm could it do. Then I got all panicky realizing what I had made the choice to do was wrong and that it would hurt Mark. I called Paul freaking out that I needed to tell Mark or break up with him. Paul said no, because telling Mark would only hurt him, and Mark would tell Mary which would fuck Paul over, and destroy the group. I agreed and told him he and I needed to stop the Dom/Sub shit leaving it open to a normal friendship.

Mark comes to my grandma's house where I'm dogsitting and we go to bed I sleep for about two hours trying to calm myself. I woke up with the worst panic attack I've ever had. Mark tries to calm me and it comes out about what I did. 

He continues hugging me and telling me its okay and that we will figure it out. Mark tells me he will never be friends with Paul at this point and that it just reinforced him leaving the D&amp;D campaign (he wanted to leave before this) and somehow we came to the conclusion that I should leave too. We are still trying to figure out how to do that without letting people know something is up. He wants me to stop hanging out with Paul one on one which is no problem by me, I just don't know how to tell Paul without him losing his shit. 

During my panic attack I made it clear that I was afraid of destroying the group and that Mary would lose it. So Mark has said he won't say anything, and has also stated its hard not to talk to people about it, and I feel like I've manipulated him and I probably did. Though to be clear Mary won't take it well, she will ban me which she has every right to do, but Mark seems to want to work through this and me being banned from his apt won't help that. Mary also has the possibility of also being angry with Mark and asking him to vacate the apt. Mark and I also agree that despite this, she will not leave Paul.

Mark has said he wants to see how things go for the next month. I've told him I will stop hanging out with Paul, and the he can check my phone whenever he wants (which he declined), I'm attempting to not rush him back to normal, and doing constant little check in questions ('how to you feel?' 'What are you thinking?' Etc). Mark also says he feels like he has a wall up about the while thing and I'm not sure what to do about it. 

Is there anything else I can do?

NOTE: Before everyone calls me a horrible person or that I'm blaming Paul. I know what I did is wrong and unacceptable, and I know that I made a conscious decision Paul and I are equally at fault.

TL;DR I allowed a friend in a Dom/sub capacity to choke me, pull my hair and I asked permission from him to cum during masterbation.

114260,Breakups,2k6bit,"Excuse me if I format terribly since this is my first post and I'm on mobile. I started lurking recently, albeit obsessively, and found the advice on this subreddit comforting. 


I'm currently a pre med in my junior year and have always been more reserved than most. This is mainly due to how my family views extracurriculars and socializing as I was growing up, but I've started to get the hang of socializing this year! People tell me I'm good looking and have a lot going for me but I'm kind of weird socially... Anyways, I met my ex-girlfriend through a friend as I was opening up to the social world and we pretty much hit it off (keep in mind this was at the start of summer break); we talked for hours through the night (on facebook) and I jokingly asked to go to her house to watch movies. To my surprise, she said yes and I nervously drove half an hour to her place. That night nothing eventful happened except for me dozing off at 4 am. Fast forward a couple weeks. At this point we were talking nonstop, engaging in endless poke wars on facebook, hanging out at every opportunity.

Before I continue, I want to add that I'm particularly clingy/dedicated (probably more the former). I would go out of my way to see her even if it meant driving at least ten miles. Sometimes she would be concerned and I'd settle for Skype. She's somewhat similar to me in the sense that she's reserved, but she also has a lot of interests whereas I'm your typical science nerd with few other hobbies. She'd also gotten into an out of state college so we both knew we shouldn't get too serious... 

Eventually as we hung out more we became emotionally invested and she slept over. We didn't do the deed the first or second night (even though we got close) but eventually we had sex. It wasn't the best sex for either of us since it was her first and she was my second (read: I'm inexperienced) but I didn't care since I got to spend the night with her. Actually what mattered was that PIV was very painful for her and I didn't really get as much as the tip in but we (possibly I) didn't look too much into this since we were occupied with each other. Come mid July she was about to leave in a few weeks and we'd gone out to eat (I only eat out if I HAVE to for a special occasion) several times to various decent restaurants. We planned a short vacation out of town and went to the movies, shopping, and eventually to a hotel (nothing eventful happened except she stayed up the whole night while I slept). We went home and pretty much went back to our routine of dining, obsessive chatting (at this point we had conversations on facebook, Skype, Gmail, snapchat, and another platform simultaneously), and hanging with common friends. Then came the day for her to move. I went to their house to help them pack and we cried as we cherished our last moment together. We pretty much established we loved each other to each other our friends (pretty much an indicator we spent too much time together). We agreed to be in a long distance relationship but she was hesitant it would work. 

We kept up our conversations as much as 2G would allow while she was on the road. When she arrived she met up with a few relatives and started to go out more so we didn't talk as much. I'll admit I was bothered by this but eventually I came to terms. She would go out almost every night and make new friends daily. Little by little our conversations declined in quality and quantity, but I was still hopeful. At this point school had started for me but I wasn't particularly stressed by school. What bothered me was trying (probably a bit too hard) to have a decent conversation (and not one word replies or Facebook stickers) with her. At first she told me needed to make friends since she had none. After at least a hundred Facebook friends she still made the same excuse, but after school started for her she was genuinely occupied with extracurriculars (from what I saw from events). At this point I started to feel stressed by school and she was no different. She had other personal problems to deal with as well but I hadn't known until much later. I put in more effort in getting her to video chat with me but she always had an excuse (staying at a friend's dorm, wifi was bad, homework) not to. I couldn't do much about it without sounding more desperate than I was already... I would tell her I love her but she stopped reciprocating as weeks passed. 

I finally had it and called her to confront her and she told me about her personal problem and how it was interfering with her life. I forgave her and let her know I was there for her no matter what and I like a dick afterwards. She said she would try to talk to me the following week but she ended up flaking on me. That was last week and I asked her if she even loved me, to which she said she hadn't really felt anything for me for a month (early/mid September - last week). She said she couldn't find the time or effort to make this work. I threatened to end it (pathetic right?) and she was against drastic measures like that so we hung around for a couple of days. Oddly enough she told me ""I knew this wouldn't work"" We talked a bit more than usual (a few exchanges) but I was still talking at least ten times as much as her. I was trying to get a conversation started but all I got were short conversation-killing replies. I called her again and we officially broke up. Things got heated and I tried to make her feel guilty but she brushed it off quite easily. She said she was stressed and wouldn't wait for me and we ended on that. I apologized to her the next day and we became friends and, what do you know, we started having actual conversations! She insisted she was not seeing anyone and I believe her but at this point I'm a mess. I know I sound pathetic defending her but I really think she's the one. At one point we were talking about graduate school and living together. She's had plenty of time to ""detox"" from me so she seems to have moved on with her life... 

So I ask you, /r/relationships, what should I do? I think she's been stressed and will come to get senses, but what do I know? Also I want to say that I know my narrating is mediocre at best and appreciate your time bearing through this wall of text. Let me know if there's anything I can do to improve posting on reddit. 



**TL;DR Two newbies at love and relationships connect over summer. LDR doesn't work and now she seems like she moved on while I'm still a wreck. **

159007,Breakups,266nnj,"So this girl and I were dating my senior year (her junior year) in high school, and into my freshman year at college. College was only an hours ride south, yet she couldn't make it down nor I up due to travel, parent and other longdistance issues. I feel like we drifted apart, yet she believed I dumped her out of the blue. Anyway break-up commences, no serious fighting but feelings hurt all around. Now she comes up with the brilliant idea of staying friends, and so we try it out, I more cautiously then her admittedly.

Couple of weeks into our new ""friendly"" relationship, she asks me over to hang out with some friends of ours. I get there and immediately start feeling weird, most of them I've bonded with only because of her, but go in thinking that everyone should be mature enough to work around it.

After people start heading out, she asks me to stay back to talk about some things. She starts mentioning prom, saying that she won't have a date and nobody will go with her and all sorts of issues that come with being a single girl at prom, and I think, ""hell, it would suck more for you to go alone than for me to go back to high school won't it?"". So when she asked, OP is going to Prom. It's in a week, but since she asked, about a month ago now, she hasn't left me a minute to myself. I feel like I'm dating her again, and she seems to believe that after prom we'll be back together, which is NOT what I'm looking for. If anything, I know I've made the right choice in breaking-up.

I already know that I have no faith in this relationship, yet she's still trying as hard as ever to keep it together.

It's also too late to back out of the prom, which I already know is going to be a shit-storm.

19102,Infidelity,31gt7t,"So i was supposed to go away for about a week.  Shortly before I left, I had a weird conversation with my gf about whether we should continue seeing each other as she will be moving home from school shortly (roughly an hour away).  

We reached the conclusion that maybe she needs some space and we would talk more when i got back.  Anyway, we talked very little while i was gone and I had a feeling that something more had happened or was going on.  

I hate myself for doing it because it's not like me at all, however when i got back I checked of her texts and messages between her and her best friends as I figured that they might have talked about what happened between us.  Very quickly I found out that while i was gone she slept with another guy and did something at a bar with a different one.  It sounded like she thought we were broken up while i was gone but the only word we ever used was space.  Anyway, so apparently she wanted to break up with me when i got back without telling me anything for fear of hurting me or something but now I'm not sure that she still wants to break up.

I really do love my girlfriend and I'm not sure how everything got to this point but I think I'd like to give her one more chance if she is willing to be honest with me.  Is that stupid/crazy? Also how should i bring this up to her without causing a blow up?  I still really regret breaking her trust by looking at her messages but I think that my gut feelings were accurate.

100463,Non-Romantic,307jus,"My friend, we'll call her Ann, has completely lost touch with reality.

**Instance 1:** Our good friend, Brian [24M], and Anna have been close friends for around four years. Brian is in a committed, loving, happy relationship. Ann is convinced that Brian is in love with her but afraid to admit it and constantly makes inappropriate sexual advances towards him. He constantly tells her to back off, says he's not interested, and has serious talks with her about how she can't do this. He eventually had to cut her out of his life completely because it was interfering with their circle of friends, his home life (her ex boyfriend of four years is his roommate) and his relationship.

**Instance 2:** She's crushed about Brian's rejection, but still convinced that they have a secret, ""sacred"" love that he will eventually come to realize. She decides that until he realizes this, she'll keep herself occupied with a new guy. So she meets someone, we'll call him Chris [34M], and on the fourth date confides in me that she is considering moving in with him and getting a dog together because she feels that she needs to ""nest"" and live with someone she's close to. She spends the night at his house a few times and changes her mind because he grinds his teeth when he sleeps.

**Instance 3:** She breaks up with Chris and meets Daniel [25M] on facebook. They have many common interests and she falls madly in love with him because ""there are too many coincidences, they must be signs."" She speaks with him for a month and they grow closer, and decide to travel together. She gets rid of her belongings (ALL of them) moves out of her house, sells her car, and says her goodbyes to her loved ones. Her loved ones ask what her plan is and she says that she'll figure it out as she goes and that Daniel has done this before and people have donated money to him out of the kindness of their hearts so if she runs out of money she'll be fine anyway. Then she leaves to go meet him for the first time. They purchase one way tickets to Thailand and travel. It seems to be going well! Lots of fun pictures, they seem happy, she's experiencing a lot, having fun. 

But then I message her about how things are going between her and this guy she's known for about a month and a half now and she says he's in love with another woman and she doesn't know where they'll sleep or what her life will be like in two months, but it's great! All a learning experience that she cherishes. She then tells me that she thinks she'll spend the rest of her life with him and they're madly in love. To become closer, they're having unprotected sex because she doesn't believe in birth control. ""The universe is in control."" I ask her what she'd do if she got pregnant, and she says she'll figure it out if it comes to that. ""The universe will provide."" She sees it as a possibility that may or may not happen and if she does get pregnant she'll find a job where she can take her baby with her and find a commune where everyone will share the responsibilities and she'll build a house with sticks and mud and grow her own food. This is her plan.

20382,Relationships,2w8qtj,"We were very close friends for 8 years and then finally began dating over a year and a half ago. I was always the short fat kid while we were best friends. I grew very late (after high school) and got in great shape. We started dating shortly after. Was I always her type and then finally got attractive enough for her so she began to date me? Probably. But who cares. I don't blame her for not being attracted to me during that period and we are very much in love and I'm more important to her than anything. I want to marry this girl. 

She is short, about 5'2-5'3, and was always curvy. Even at her lightest (as low as 100 lbs in high school) she still had curvy hips and butt. Which I'm very attracted to. We started dating shortly after we both turned 21 and alcohol consumption has not helped her weight. She works very hard with a busy schedule so working out is not a top priority of hers. She also doesn't make much of an effort to eat healthy. In the last 2 years, she's gained at least 50 pounds. She is technically obese at this point. I am absolutely still attracted to her. I think truly loving someone makes them more attractive. 

But it's beginning to get out of hand. She has gone from about 130 lbs to at least 180 lbs. She often has an upset stomach which I contribute to her diet. She gets really hot doing easy tasks and constantly complains of restaurants being too hot when I'm completely comfortable or even cold. I attribute that to the extra layers of fat she's put on. 

She knows she's put on weight and joined weight watchers this past fall. She only gained more weight since starting weight watchers. We have a trip a tropical vacation planned for next September and she always says she's losing weight so she can wear a bikini. But she never actually does anything about it. She exercises for a day or two then gives up for 3 weeks. And repeat. 

I'm still attracted to her because the change has been gradual. But when I look back on her facebook or instagram and see what she used to look like, honestly, I'm disappointed. I struggled with weight my entire life and I'm still self-conscious of my body image. What can I say to her? What can I do for her? I don't want her to think I'm unattracted to her or anything.

I recently broke up with my girlfriend after she drank an entire bottle of wine in about an hour and became physically abusive toward me. Nothing that required medical attention, but I had bruises for a couple weeks and scarring from where she clawed at my arm with her nails. I refuse to respond to a girl physically, so I did little to mitigate the damage. This was the second time she has gotten drunk and become physically violent. The first time was in a hotel and the police were called by other patrons. 


A little background. We've dated for a little over a year. A few months in when she went back to school, I knew something was up. She would lose entire days to anxiety attacks and break down sobbing when her professor would mark corrections on a rough draft. Just not normal behavior, but I thought she was just super stressed out from being older and going back. 


Then her dad moved into town out of nowhere and I really found out a lot about her. She was suddenly uncontrollably angry all the time and started drinking excessively. Long story short, I finally said I'd had enough and she crossed the line in the sand and I left her. I went on vacation a few days later with some friends and while I was gone she decided to start seeing an anger management therapist. I agreed to give her another chance if she kept going. He believes that she suffers from BPD or possibly PTSD due to (non-sexual) abuse during her childhood. After her 5th session, she claimed that he released her and she showed me a form that vaguely said as much. 


Everything was fine for a month or so and then she started pressuring me to move in with her. Even though I felt 6 months was too fast, she said I needed to make a commitment to her. It became an every day discussion and most days an argument. I had spent a lot of time reading about BPD and read a great book called Walking on Eggshells. I learned to identify her behaviors and try to react to them in a positive way. 


So, I used the moving in thing to try and leverage getting her into treatment for her BPD. She claims there is nothing wrong with her. Then the hotel incident happens and I draw another line in the sand. I tell her if she ever touches me out of anger again that we're done.


Fast forward to now and that obviously happened. I'm traveling for work, but now she is saying that she is attending AA classes and that if I will give her a chance when I get home she will go to therapy for her BPD. 


I do love her, but I don't feel like I can trust her anymore. I don't know how to be with her in a healthy way. I do want to be with her, but what is a relationship without trust? The other side of it is I feel immense guilt for not trying to help her work through her disorder. I know it isn't her fault, but I feel like she could choose treatment on her own and I shouldn't have to bargain my affection for that to happen.

Any way, he has angry problems, he accepts it and says he's going to get help and has actually looked for a therapists,  haven't started yet tho. 
Now, I do love him and I think he loves me too after all the commitment we've both done with the long distance, but whenever we fight or argue he would try to hurt me with words and comments. Like he would be mean about my country's situation and culture for example saying that we are in this situation cause we are all a bunch of lazy ass and rather getting drunk than working or that if employment is a problem is because we want to. I feel like he looks down on me about this and honestly hurts.
He's been mean many times before, making comments on people for making wrong decisions in life and how stupid they are even tho he has no idea of their real situation, to him anyone who's not working all the time and in something making a lot of money are losers and worthless (like people working on restaurants or retail) 
I feel like I cannot tell him a lot of stuff I would love to share with him about my life and what worries me, I'm unemployed myself right now cause my country is going through a really rough patch and there's no jobs for anyone.

I would love to tell him more and be able to talk about how I really feel but I'm afraid in case he throws it to my face during an argument.

124063,Dating,1synaq,"I finally told my best friend of the last 3 years how I really felt about her the other night, something I've wanted to get off my chest for absolutely ages.

As I say we've been friends for 3 years now, I actually met her at a soccer game and just really got on well straight away. From that point onwards we've been able to see each other pretty regularly considering the distance between us, and talk plenty, it got to the stage where we have mutual friends so by this point the distance
and way in which we met outside our usual friendship circles didn't matter at all.

I had a crush on her from pretty early on and took plenty of stick from friends for spending so much time talking to her etc. In hindsight I know that she has never been attracted to me per say, as I know her type and she has always talked to me about guys she likes and the issues she's had getting anywhere with them. 

Mind you she's also told me plenty about guys coming on to her that she has no interest in beyond being friends, and since one mutual friend of ours made a similarly misjudged move on her I've always feared falling into the same trap if I tried to tell her how I feel. 

What's crazy now is that we're actually at the same university, where I'm a 3rd year and she's a 1st. Nothing has really changed, I see her more often obviously but nothing was different until the other night, which was the last night out of the year before Christmas break. 

She found me and seemed really keen to stay with me despite her friends heading home, I bought drinks and we danced a bit before
heading outside and eventually heading back to mine at her request.

Now nothing overly intimate occurred during the night but I thought when is there likely to be a more potentially effective way of telling her how I felt. I had tried to do it in the past but never been able to, and balancing not wanting to lose my best friend but also wanting to tell her I really really like her has left me beating myself up inside so much over the past year or so.

So I told her and also made it clear that I'd really appreciate some sort of answer. We'd been talking about the potential romantic pursuits that had both gone cold for us or we'd chosen not to make more of, so I really thought that maybe this was some sort of sign. 

In the end all she could really tell me was that she didn't know how she felt about me. Part of me sees some positive in that in that it's not a flatout no, but a greater part of me sees it as even worse than before. 

Now I can't stop thinking about her even more than before. Friends have asked me about us as a potential couple so many times and the one person I've told about our night together really struggles to
understand her standpoint. 

I can't help but have this theory that she does like me, but isn't attracted to me, and I think she puts enough importance on physical
attractiveness (which is totally fair enough) that I'm unlikely to ever get anywhere. 

We love spending time together, we make each other laugh, we can talk about literally anything with one another, I really do feel as though there's a whole lot of signs that not being together would be some sort of fuckup. 

I am super torn. I know it sounds like a classic case of being in the friendzone but from talking to people that know us both I'm not sure it's as simple as that, and I am really struggling to cope with not knowing, my inner pessimist is absolutely killing me.

542,Relationships,39guwo,"Hey guys. So, I just wanted some quick advice. I've been dating an amazing girl for 7 months. She has all the traits I've ever wanted in a girlfriend. After being cheated on in High School, I was very hesitant to get back in a relationship. However, it was easy with her.

We started dating 2 weeks after we met. There was no awkward first date to see if their was feelings and than a kiss after. The way I knew she liked me was us making out in my room. We dated for 3 weeks and then began our relationship. We recently just went past 7 months and I'm loving every second of it. I fell hard for this girl. Way harder than I wanted too. There's just a couple problems, and these problems are making me consider breaking up with her.

Before we started dating, she was in a relationship with a guy for 3 years. Someone who she admits she saw herself marrying one day. They went to college 3 hours away from each other, but they made it work. One day, he just dumped her over text. Obviously upset, she drove up to see him. According to her, they barely talked. He gave a couple reasons, and that was that. She was devastated. We started dating 6 months after that. She said she wasn't looking for someone either when she met me. However, like me, she just said it was easy. However, she still clearly not over it. Even after an entire year and some change, she's not over it. She just doesn't have any closure. Myself and many of her friends have told her to talk to him, but she's scared to do so. She doesn't want her old feelings for him to show up and for me to get hurt. I don't think this would happen though, because she's told me she doesn't have any feelings for him.

The last couple of months, this whole issue with her ex has been a problem. But it hasn't just been about him and not going to talk to him, it has been about how she changed after that. It affected how she treated relationships in general. Now, I'll preface this by saying yes, we do both love each other. The issue is that it is obvious I love her more than she loves me. We've both told the other about this. As a result, I see more in her than she sees in me. I can honestly say this is someone I could see myself marrying one day. She on the other hand couldn't say that. She said it's because she can't make plans for the future. She did once, and she got majorly hurt. I understand that, but I would think she could see some sort of future with me. Now, when I say I could see myself marrying her, that doesn't mean I actually want to marry her. There's alot in my life I want/need to do before I settle down. It just worries me that she can't see any future with me.

And then, the part that worries me most. We were talking about this issue of myself loving her than she loves me and she told me this gem. She told me that it wasn't me that was the problem. That I am literally everything she's ever wanted in a boyfriend (even listed them off). It's just she doesn't feel that right now. She wants too, but she can't. This definitely concerned me alot. I've always thought if the feelings aren't there, they just aren't there. I wouldn't want her to 'try' to get feelings for me. They should come naturally.

So, I was thinking of breaking up with her. Not only to help myself, but help her as well. Just to kinda ease the feelings away and not get more her by spending more time together. I don't know if I'm overreacting and just need to be more patient and wait, or if this is a real problem. My friends aren't very helpful, but I figured you lot might be. If there are any questions, feel free to ask and I'll give the best response possible. Thanks!

131246,Breakups,2a1n3p,"I met my ex, we'll call her M, after she moved in with two friends of mine about six years ago. We hit it off really well at first and became good friends, but she had just gotten out of a relationship (she moved out of her then ex's place to live with my friends) so wasn't wanting to commit to anything, which I understood/respected. I stayed friends with her and things eventually evolved into a serious relationship.

We of course had our ups and down but for the most part were very happy together. We had a month long break in May of 2012 but got back together shortly after, and then moved in together in September of 2012. Living together unfortunately proved to put a strain on things and we both became somewhat unhappy with one another due to a multitude of reasons. She eventually found another guy and thought the grass was greener on his side of the fence, was lying to me and hiding things from me and was emotionally cheating on me, and ostensbily physically as well, starting around March of 2013. By May of that year I broke up with her and kicked her out of the apartment. Since then she's moved out of town to live with her new guy, and aside from sending me random texts (giving me her new number which I found odd, wishing me a happy birthday, trying to check in on me, etc.) I haven't heard from her. I've been strictly no contact up until a month-ish ago when she sent me a Facebook message asking if I was ever going to talk to her again. My response was basically telling her I had no desire or reason to, especially considering she had shown no remorse for and had not apologized for anything she had done to me. 

I feel as I if I am 100% completely over her and have been for some time. I am actively seeking a relationship and I've seen a few girls via OKCupid. I was dating one of them for a month, but nothing serious developed with her.

As of last week, I have had extremely intense feelings of missing my ex. It's more than just pining over her; I want to attempt to rekindle our relationship entirely. I don't know if it's my desire to have a relationship that's sparking these feelings or what it, but I'm having a hard time resisting the urge to break NC and telling her how I feel. I know she still thinks about me and misses me, but I don't know if my feelings would be reciprocated. I'm of the mind to try my luck because I really have nothing to lose, but I don't know what to do.

We had been friends, hooking up every once in a while throughout college, but I was always scared to get in a relationship because of what my parents would think.

Since we were both still in college when we started actually dating, I didn't have to worry about my parents finding out, but I recently graduated and moved back in with my parents. Every time I visited her or stayed over her place I would have to lie to my parents about where I was and why I didn't come home the night before.

I told my parents about her one day while having a casual conversation and they yelled at me, telling me things like how could you date a black girl, you should be ashamed of yourself, you should break up with her, we never want to see her, how could you lie to us all this time, and much more. I didn't expect that, thinking they would be supportive, especially since one of my cousins is married to a black guy. 

Instead of continuing to listen to them, I stayed over my friends house for the next two days, giving them a little time to think, and when I came back nothing seemed to change.

Recently me and her have been having issues, stretching back 4 weeks from today. 

I came home one night and she said we needed to talk and that she wasn't sure she wanted to be in a committed relationship anymore. 

I had no idea that this was how she was feeling. It came out of nowhere and hit me pretty hard. We both got emotional and then decided to try and work things out, for three weeks we would have the same conversation on Monday. Until last Monday. 

On last Monday I told her she needs to go stay with her parents because I can't keep coming home to 'We need to talk about us' every week. It was hard, and she asked me to let her stay many, many times. But I told her to go. 

After she left I didn't talk to her until wed morning, I was in a car accident and my car was  damaged and she came and picked me up. She said that she felt like she needed to come home to help me because our jobs were more important at the moment. 

We car pooled Thursday and Friday. Friday afternoon I asked her if she wanted more space and that I could find another car and I would be okay. She said no, I asked her if she felt like she was falling out of love with me and she said she felt like it sometimes. 

That conversation basically went nowhere and we had to get back to work. ( it was done in person on my lunch) 

Saturday morning comes along and she starts acting weird again, so I give it to her straight, I tell her that I'm tired of being left to hang on all of this and that by pushing me away she was making me resent her and out relationship, for 3 years we had nor problems and we just needed to sit down and talk with no cards hidden. I would listen like her friend and make no judgments and she would do the same. 

She was upset, and went to work. I honestly didn't expect her to come home, but she did. 

At first it was a normal saturday. Just chilling and watching a movie and laughing and drinking and relaxing. Until our friends invite us out and she asks if I think its a good idea becase it might be weird. 

So we start to talk and I ask her the real reason for all of this. 

Apparently she is ashamed of her self for having a crush on another guy at work.  

She shows me her phone and facebook and email and says she is not cheating on me, nor talking to him out side of work and she doesn't flirt with him. 

I tell her that I don't consider this a bad thing, people are going to come in and out of your life that will make you wonder and tempt you. IT's part of being in a relationship, and the important thing is that you weigh what you have now and your committement to that person to see if the relationship is still what you want. She just feels embarrassed and ashamed. 

I feel that I can trust her on not cheating, she has no weirdness about me and her phone, email, and she uses my computer and knows full well I can get in and around when I want to. We don't hide things from each other, she can peruse my phone and sometimes she does. 

I trust her 100%, she doesn't try to hide where she is and is never just gone out partying or anything like that for the night. Not that I would care anyways, i trust her. The last time she made out with a girl she woke me up at 4am after driving home and crying to tell me what happened. I

Now we are both bisexual, She has no issues with me doing anything with annother man, and to be honest I don't care about her with other women. We have had threesomes and have talked about other couples. we are very sex positive. My line is that when you're with me, you're with me. I don't do open relationships and I would not be okay if she started dating anyone else. She knows that.  

This is where I am confused, asked her if she would be upset if I slept with another woman. 

She said ""I don't know, but probably not"" and that she thinks she would be okay with sharing me because deep down she feels like I will always come back to her. 

I guess I don't really know how to feel when the woman I love says she's not worreid about losing me... 

She said she doesn't want to break up, we have all these festivals and concerts planned for this summer and spring and she still says that she can't see herself there with anyone else. 

I had been talking to a guy this week, just a friends I just met him and he was just someone I could talk to with out bias. He is gay and did flirt with me a lot. She wanted to know that I sometimes had feelings towards other people and I said yes, sometimes I meet someone and they seem amazing, but I rememeber what I have already and I know that I am happy. 

She read through the messages and seems to point out things that he said. Almost like she wasn't threatened by him? In the end I just had to ask her if it turned her on with what she was reading and she enthusiastically said yes. 

Then we had sex. Sunday was a normal day. We chilled and watched tv and made food and then we had sex again like normal, we opened new toys and I used them on her. 

I honestly feel lost, I feel like I still need to hash somethings out but I don't know if now is the right time. 

I mean, we have done nothing but talk and talk and talk about this and we finally made headway. I told her that if this is going to work she needs to start trying to make it work and not just leave it to me anymore. Because I will leave her, I just don't know if understands that fully. 


Mostly, I just need opinions. I take everything with a grain of salt because I can only give you one side of the story. But I just need some help, or idea of what to do.

We don't usually fight, but sometimes, like today, he will make a mistake and go into full meltdown mode. Today, I brought home a project for a class for him to look at, and when he was handing it back to me, he dropped it. A small piece broke off, and that's when he lost it.

Now, I was not angry. Barely even peeved. I'm very laid-back and I know that shit happens. It clearly was an accident, but he totally freaked, saying he was done for the day. He holed himself up in the bedroom, where he's been for the last couple of hours.

That kind of behavior, unlike an honest mistake, *does* make me really angry. I hate it when he does this and honestly it's baffling to me. We're normally such good communicators and have had no issues dealing with finances, unemployment, or problems stemming from my mental illness, which is now well under control.

I don't understand how he can be so reasonable so much of the time and then turn into a huge fucking baby when something like this happens. I've tried making it clear to him that, usually, whatever the ""mistake"" he makes is doesn't bother me nearly as much as the way he acts about it. It's very melodramatic, especially coming from someone relatively reserved.

I don't really know how to handle him during these moments except for doing it the way I'd do with an actual child, and walking away. I don't know if that's healthy or not, but he makes it very difficult to resolve anything when he blows it so far out of proportion I can barely remember what caused the reaction.

Is there any way I can help him be more communicative in these situations?

* I don't want to see food pellets on the ground.

Important to note:


* The lease to the apartment is under his name. I am not mentioned anywhere so I can't complain to the landlord.

* He makes a ton of money so if it come to me or the bird. The bird will stay and I will leave. He doesn't really need my contribution. He just doesn't like living alone.

* We have been together for 2 years and I know how he operates and I don't want to spend a lot of time to get to know a new roommate.

* I can rent a studio alone but my costs will essentially double if I do which is not ideal.


Am I overreacting? And what should I do now?

   
**tl;dr**: Roommate bought a pet without consulting me knowing full well that I would not agree to it.

98454,Dating,35ono8,"Some background on me... I've been in one really long term relationship, and a few 6-9 month relationships. They were all awful, and I was mistreated in every single one of them. I was denied physical and emotional affection. I was manipulated, and made to feel inferior as a way to use me for whatever the girl felt. The long term relationship lasted 3 or 3-1/2 years. I supported her financially and took her problems on as my own, while she did not reciprocate. Pretty much: All the women in my life have abused, used, and treated me like shit.

So, the story goes as such: A few friends of mine and me go camping every year as a large group. The year of 2014, this girl was there with her boyfriend. So I didn't talk to her. (I didn't want to step on any toes, and she never approached me.) I definitely noticed she was cute, and she seemed cool, but I didn't get to know her any better. We'd exchange quips on FB after. Between the trip of 2014 and 2015, her boyfriend and her broke up (they had been dating for a long time). So, this year she was single. We instantly felt a connection and comfort with each other. Every time she'd feel uncomfortable, she'd come find me. I never made a move because I thought she was way out of my league. But the day we got back to civilization, she messaged me on FB. We have been talking since (this year's trip was March 1-4). We currently live 200 miles from each other. But she is on the way to my home town from my college town.

We instantly began having intensely deep and meaningful conversations. We discussed our past mistakes, our issues with relationships, and how we learned from it. On every level, we connected. I was instantly infatuated with her, and it seemed like she was with me as well. My hopes began to build, until one day I admitted that I ""like-liked"" her. She told me she wasn't the girl for me. I broke down and cried that night.

The next day, we talked again and I got to the bottom of it: she claimed she didn't want to be in a serious relationship with anyone right now. She wanted to find herself, and have 'Me' time. I understood that, and respected that. But she kept returning affection and intimacy. At least in a way that I felt was not conducive to someone who was not romantically interested in someone else. We talked from the moment we woke up, until we fell asleep. It was rarely idle chat. We usually had a topic, and some way to get to know each other better.

Jump forward to Easter weekend. We had been talking intensely for a month. I had flirted with the idea of going down under the guise of Easter and hanging out with her. My best friend said he was gonna be passing through my town, and was heading to our home town. I asked if I could hitch a ride, and he said of course. I then asked if he'd want to stop and meet up with this girl for lunch on the way down. He agreed, knowing how interested I was in her. We had lunch, and she and I agreed that I'd head down to my Mom's house, then drive back up. An hour each way. I spent some time with my family, and drove up excited. We talked for hours, nothing sexual -- but passionate just the same. I ended up crashing at her house because it got too late. I slept on her brother's bed. She told me to wake her up the next day, so I woke her up gently. Then she asked me to tickle her back, and pulled her shirt all the way up. I did, happily. Eventually I was kissing her shoulders, neck, back, and sides. We eventually stopped that (we never kissed on the lips). Went to the beach, then came back to her house. She kept postponing a dinner with her step-mom to spend more time with me. We ended up back in her bed, doing the same thing as the morning. I eventually got her on her back, went in for the kiss and she pulled away. I left with my head between my legs, sad and confused.

We continued to talk extensively until a mutual friend's birthday. She came up to my town for it. That was April 26th. We hung out every day that weekend, and a lot. The first night we didn't do anything. But the second night, it ended up being just she and me on a couch alone at night. That turned into cuddling, and eventually kissing.

It was then when she told me the truth: she had been ""talking to"" a guy from NY. Someone who had been a very positive force in her life since her break up. She said that she wasn't sure what she wanted, or what she wanted to do. She told me that it didn't take away her feelings toward me. We embraced each other, and I tickled her back until she fell asleep (at the house she was staying at). I went home that night. The next day I get a call for brunch at that same house. We hung out there for a while until she messaged me on FB asking if we could go to my house and hang out for a bit. I said 'of course', hoping to get to kiss her again. We went to my house, and we ended up having sex. It was incredibly passionate, and by far the best sex I've ever had. We wanted to go for round two, but I hadn't been having much sex. So I didn't have any condoms left. So, we fooled around a bit more, and that was that. She left, and I got a good-bye kiss. That was that. We talked about it more, and she'd tell me how she wasn't sure about this guy in NY. Then we'd talk about us -- really intense things. Like us getting married, our preference of parental stylings, and even where we'd want to live together.

There wasn't much of a stability to these thoughts of hers. Mine were steadfast. She asked me one day if she could see us getting married. I told her, I couldn't see us not getting married if we dated. I feel that to be the truth, too. We complement each other very well, and balance each other out while still giving enough understanding of each other's issues.

In the interim, she told me that the guy in NY has become increasingly distant, and increasingly less affectionate. I was on the phone with her (she was drunk), and I asked her how she'd feel if he called her and told her it was over. She told me she'd be upset, but she'd be okay with it in the end. I then asked her how she'd feel if she and I stopped talking. She said she'd be devastated. I told her to compare those feelings; and that they were telling. She thought about it, and moved on.

Now, the other day we were talking and she said she wanted to come visit me so bad, but didn't want the people in our group of friends knowing. Because she didn't want her ex to find out, and didn't want people to talk. I talked to my roommates, and we all agreed to keep it hush. We got her a bus ticket to come up on May 5th. The Sunday prior, we were messaging and she said in passing, ""I wish I could go up tomorrow!"" I researched into getting the ticket changed, and told her we could change it. She agreed, and she came up the next day. We spent the next few days as a couple. We cuddled, hugged, touched and kissed. We were incredibly comfortable with each other [I have this thing, where most times after sex, I put on boxers. It's not that I'm uncomfortable being naked, I'm just not as comfortable as when I have my boxers on. With her, I felt more comfortable naked].

Everything was great. We drove back down to our homes, the whole time we held hands in the car, and all of that. But when we got home, it went back to the same old: she would accept my affection, but never return it. She would listen to what I had to say about us, but would never tell me how she felt.
In person, she returned the affection and made it truly seem like she wanted to be with me.


So, now I'm sitting here and unable to make a decision. The decision boils down to this:
Either I wait around, and hope she leaves the guy in NY. Then hopes she decides to be with me.
Or, I stop thinking about her as anything more than a friend. Not be sexual at all with her. Then try to find someone new.


TL;DR:
Met an awesome girl who gets along with me really well. At first claims she doesn't want a relationship, but we get increasingly close and intimate. Eventually find out she's ""talking to"" a guy in a different state. She spend nearly a week at my apartment as a couple with me. Now she's back to being distant.
