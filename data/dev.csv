I'm the girl my friends have always gone to with fashion emergencies, the one in charge of layout for school projects, etc. I've freelanced as a graphic designer, and now work in marketing, which I love.

I have an apartment I adore, and have it decorated exactly to my taste. I am little obsessive over what comes into my house--if a book has a color scheme I don't like, I'll buy a different version or make a dust jacket for it. Nothing--not my forks, not my tissue boxes--goes in without consideration of its aesthetic impact. I invested in a couple pieces of art, and they are some my most valued possessions.

My bf is fantastic. We're both really respectful of each other, have lots of fun and have shared values &amp; vision of the future. Sort of.

My boyfriend's aesthetic tastes really don't match mine. He has advertising posters in his shared apartment. His bedroom has neon beer light things. They make me shudder. His furniture is mostly hand-me-downs from friends and family or garage sale finds (and not like vintage stuff). I totally admire this thrift, but I can't stand any of it. We just have different values when it comes to aesthetics, and I'd never criticize his clothes, or grooming, or what he does in his own space.

His lease is running out at the end of the summer, and his current roommate is making noises about moving in with his gf. My bf and I love each other, and are at the stage where we should be moving forward. He is hoping to move in with me, and I keep postponing the conversation. I can't stand the idea of moving in together with his stuff.  If I mention offhand, well, the frat-boy decorations might not be welcome, he gets a bit offended.

I realize this is abnormal. I'm willing to compromise on chores, time spent on hobbies, on food, time spent with our families, whatever.
But this is really important to me, and I don't want to compromise. I could not bear it if any of his stuff came into my place, but I'm pretty sure if I said that, he'd be horribly offended. If we are starting a life together, both should be contributing. I don't know how to have this conversation, and how to reach a compromise
that makes us both happy.

He's a musician and plays shows all weekend usually at bars until about 4am and I kind of got sick of seeing girls hit on him so I stopped attending them to benefit our relationship so I wouldnt get so jealous.

These past couple of months have been hard as he has stopped paying attention to me sexually (I pretty much have to spend an hour coaxing him once a week and even then its 60% chance he'll just pretend to be doing something else) and when we go out he openly flirts with, say for one example a young, pretty musician [18/f] infront of me and when I speak about it to him he denies it.

12093,Relationships,1nuhpa,"Hi.

I'm 24F, and I recently moved to an entirely new place from where I'm originally from for work. I also went through a breakup ~3 months ago from a guy that I thought I would spend my life with. The relationship actually wasn't that long duration-wise, but the dude was my best friend for 7 years prior so it was hard.  I've moved on, but the scars of that relationship I think are still affecting me in annoying ways, and I'm looking for advice on how to prevent myself from sabotaging everything with my new relationship. 


So, anyways, I made a friend when I moved out here, and we both decided we liked each other as more than just friends about 3 weeks to a month after hanging out a lot. We haven't done much physical-wise, since he's had some performance anxiety, but I don't really care about that very much. It sucks, but I know he finds me attractive, there's just some mental block, and I make sure I don't put any pressure on it. 

Anyways, I really like this guy and he's a real gentleman and I'm not sure what is wrong with me, but I'm ruining it because I have some hang ups about certain things that I'm working on but I'm not sure how to fix it faster ..

I'll try to list out some examples: 

He's gotten really busy with work, more than when we were just hanging out having fun, and I realize that I'm lonely since the move and all, but it doesn't seem like he actually reaches out to hang out that much even when he does have a little time. I did bring it up, though, and I think we reached a compromise where he wouldn't just call when he could spend the entire night, but shorter dates as well. So that I feel pretty fine about now, but I'm not sure if I'm asking too much or overstepping boundaries, but he seemed okay with it.

Sometimes he says things offhandedly that I take seriously, as I'm just kinda literal, and I'm finding it hard to just find a middle ground of taking him too seriously.. Like, we were going to hang out one of the days this past week and he said that he just had to do work in the evening, and he said that multiple times and I was totally cool with it. Then that day comes and he suddenly has to leave by noon, and it just kind of affected me really negatively. I brought it up, but he didn't remember saying evening and denied it until I showed him the text. 

And he said he wanted to Skype and he knew it was really important to me and he never brought it up, it was like 9:30 and I brought it up and it didn't end up happening since he wasn't feeling well, but I just don't want to feel like I have to be the one to reach out for these things or hanging out. 

I also have taken some things he's said the wrong way, but I think that happens to everyone sometimes.. 

I know one issue that is completely mine is that I'm just kind of having a hard time making friends so I'm too focused on this relationship. We've talked about things, but I'm basically sabotaging the relationship with these stupid issues that I shouldn't care about. I'm just not sure how to get past it, and I'm sorry if I'm coming across as crazy, I'm just so upset with myself over these silly things ruining everything.

12094,Relationships,2hfgt6,"My boyfriend of 3+ years and I are in a long distance relationship due to him being military.  I understand that, as a man, he likes to look at porn.  And who can blame him? I see him maybe twice a year!  The long distance has never been a serious problem for us either.  I'm very happy with our relationship and so is he!  This is the only argument we've had in over a year and I don't even consider it really an argument.

At first, I'll admit, the porn made me uncomfortable.  At the time I had no desire to watch it and I felt I couldn't wrap my head around why he liked it.  In my mind I equated it with him not being attracted to me, blah blah blah.  Of course, that's not the case and when I had him talk to me one-on-one to explain why he watched it I was satisfied with his answer and felt I had a better understanding on the inner-workings of a man's brain (lol).  Occasionally when insecurities would crop up porn would be a slight source of contention.  My boyfriend was always good at making me feel better about myself and re-explaining that he wasn't attracted to the girls in porn like he was to me.  Sometimes you just have to hear you're pretty, you know?

Anyway, eventually he thought it would be a good idea if we watched some porn together and I agreed that that would be fun.  The next time we saw each other we watched a few videos during sexy time and I felt much better about the whole porn scene.

The issues started when I started watching porn alone.  I mentioned it offhand to him and he seemed uncomfortable with it.  I'll admit this made me a little miffed, but I told him I totally understood where he was coming from.  I told him I was relieved a bit that I wasn't the only one who experienced these insecurities and that if he wanted me to I wouldn't watch it.  We agreed that we would from now on only watch porn together.  I promised him I would send more sexy pics of myself to help him out, too.  You see, I wasn't always to thrilled to send dirty pics because they made me nervous and I always figured well, he has porn so he'll just supplement the few I do send with that.  Also, the idea of my pics being used with conjunction with porn kind of made me feel weird and I wasn't jumping on any opportunity to send them.  I wasn't withholding anything, just not self-motivated.  I expressed this to him and he understood where I was coming from.

Anyway, a month or two later I brought up porn and he confessed that he had watched it once or twice after we agreed not to.  I was a little upset.  I mean, I gave up porn and hadn't watched it at all!  The porn-watching itself didn't bother me, but the hypocrisy sure did!  He felt really bad and it's not like he watches it every night or even every week.  And I told him it wasn't such a big deal, but I wanted to know where we stood on all the porn stuff for certain.

I tried to imagine myself watching porn knowing that it made my boyfriend uncomfortable and I couldn't.  I just can't bring myself to do something that makes him feel insecure.  Especially something as insignificant as porn!

I told him this and he agreed he wouldn't watch it either.  The thing is, I don't want him to promise not to do something he's going to go back on in a moment of weakness.  Especially since it's not that big of a deal for me.  I equate it to both of us going on a diet together and promising not to eat junk food.  Then he has a bad day and eats a twinkie or two behind my back.  I'm miffed, but not really legitimately angry with him.

How can we reach an agreement that respects both parties and doesn't result in going back on any promises.  I guess I really would just like some outside opinions on this since it's such a weird situation.

12095,Infidelity,2abqqu,"2 years into our relationship, she made out and got felt up by a guy at a wedding. I did not see it coming at all and found out about it a few months later. 

I broke up with her immediately and it wrecked both of our worlds. We had 6 months of back and forth conversations where she would often take my verbal abuse over her cheating. I got over it by believing that she had simply gotten too drunk and it'd mixed with her antidepressants to impair judgement. I've never bought the excuse that someone gets too drunk but I have seen how alcohol mixed with her Meds and it was like she was a different person. This does not absolve her of responsibility and she paid for it with her own suffering and the awful things I said at the time. 

Since that incident, she had given up drinking. I've always been one to believe once a cheater, always a cheater and would tell a friend in a similar situation not to give a second chance but I talked it out with some friends of mine who we're supportive of me and most asked if I saw a future and if I could forgive, to try to fix it. 

She always had been and still is essentially the ideal girlfriend - loving, thoughtful, etc.  Since the first year after the incident, I've largely forgotten about it or at least put it out of my mind

Last night however I had a dream where she had written some journal detailing how she cheated and gotten away with it and basically tricked me into marrying her. I've never had that thought once until now. I haven't thought about the incident for 5 years. Our wedding is coming up in 3 months and I honestly have not had cold feet about it at all. Is it possible wedding stress just caused my mind to go this way?

This dream just really shook up my mind and I haven't been able to sleep since 2 am

12096,Infidelity,1ytzpj,"Hello r/relationships!

Im kinda having this personal crisis right now and i dont know what to do at all anymore.
I went to a party for, maybe a month ago, with my SO and a couple of friends. It was a pretty big party, around 50 people came (which is big for my little suburb).

So for a little backround story, my SO and i are not exactly together. We have been 'exclusive' to each-other since the end of last summer. I've had no problem in engaging in a relationship but she has specifically told me that i shouldnt be expecting to officially be together. We are also best friend. We bonded extreme quickly over the span of a week and since then we have been talking to each-other for every single day and we are really close. Leaving her or cutting her out of my life is not an option, she means to much for me.

So at this party, she got really drunk and at the end i had to help her out as she could barely walk. To this party, a really popular guy came, he is known for being a real douchebag but is really attractive and ofcourse all the girl want him. My SO, has also had a thing for this guy and i know of this, and i was really worried already that something could happen.

Ofcourse, this guy was hitting on her alot, getting her more drunk and was kenoing the fuck out of her. I wasnt present at the time and i trusted her enough to believe she wouldnt do anything with him. Something did happen though, she got even more drunk and they hooked up. According to what she said, he was nagging her on over the course of an hour that they should make out and at first, she disregarded it and said to him that they couldnt because she didnt want to hurt me (im so extremely pissed about this, literally broke my nuckle hitting the wall when i read it). She also said one of my best friends which is also a really good friend the other guy was really cheering for them to hook up, together with a bunch of other guys standing around in a circle.

So this happened about a month ago, i was really pissed at her for over a week and i got on with it, i pardoned her and the next saturday we met again but after watching a movie and hooking up, she reminded me of it and i became furious about it again, leading to her leaving and me breaking a wall. We promised each-other that we would work it out and we kinda have and we are getting along well but i really cant get over it.

So i dont know what im asking but i just want to hear your thought on this. Im so incredibly pissed about it and i dont understand why she did it (she blames it on the alcohol and peer pressure from the people cheering them on). I really want to deal with it, but i cant trust her and i just saw a picture of them making on at the party as i was talking to her on the phone and i cant wrap my head around it, im mentally fucked.

For example; two days ago at a friends housewarming party one of her old classmates was present. She asked the guy if he had heard from a mutual friend, who happens to be the hostess' ex. Normally it wouldn't be too bad, but this particular ex cheated on her, and then dumped her a few weeks after she forgave him, so obviously she doesn't like to talk/hear about him, and our friend knows this.

Our friends then blurts out 130 lbs!? in a loud and incredulous voice so everyone can hear it, and the look on the hostess' face said it all.

I'm an over-analytic INTP, like I suspect many redditors are, and I tend to look at life in cold, concrete terms. Did I achieve something today? A specific something? Is it helping advance my life in a general sort of way? I've followed the traditional HS -&gt; college -&gt; job -&gt; job advancement model, and it's worked really well for me. It has also made me bad at dealing with problems outside of the privileged white guy life.

My wife suffers from severe anxiety, and that single fact kind of defines our entire relationship. Her life has been a series of failures by traditional school/work metrics (do I have a degree? is my life on track? etc.), and not all of them have been her fault, but she judges herself harshly for all of them anyway. She does an OK job of keeping her chin up, but progress towards where she wants to be in her life -- a real job, stable income, etc. -- has been agonizingly slow. Her mostly-positive attitude, when not swamped by her anxiety, has not led to any actual changes in her life over the last few years.

My approach to our relationship has been to be as positive and supporting as possible, but it hasn't improved things; it's just kept them from deteriorating, I think. Every time I try to broach the subject of her goals and progress in life, she gets intensely defensive, and those conversations usually end in tears. It breaks my heart.

We all ended up skinny dipping in the backyard pool and later I went to bed a bit earlier than my friends, and because we were skinny dipping, I only bothered to put on my underwear and a towel after that. I went to bed in just my underwear.

Later, when my friends wanted to sleep. my female friend went to her bed to sleep (it was her house), and my male friend joined me in the bed. It was completely normal to all of us since we have all been friends for over 4 years, and we all trust each other very much. However, my male friend started groping my chest a short while after he got into bed. I was awake, but very very drunk and drowsy, and I didn't know what to do, so I just let it happen, and he stopped after a few minutes. Later, after I fell asleep, I woke up twice to my friend with his hand in my underwear trying to finger me, and I stopped him. After the second time, I left the bed to go sleep on a couch. 

Now my question is, was I sexually assaulted? I have been struggling with this ever since it has happened. I did not want it to happen, but we were both very drunk, I think my male friend was even more drunk than I am.

Even with the differences in our intellects, we have more similarities than differences.  We're both rather soft-spoken(though she is positively garrulous on the phone), and we both like video games.

Her bedroom is probably the perfect expression of her as a person.  She has a lot of things you might expect to find in a young girl's room, like stuffed animals, toys, and just general girly-girl knick-knacks.  Other things, you would expect to find in a mature woman's room.  She keeps it neat, almost obsessively so.  Thankfully, she's not into My Little Ponies.  *wipes his brow

Despite her inexperience(and mine), she knows exactly what she wants in the bedroom.  From the beginning, I left it up to her as to how far we would go.  I've never pushed.  Turns out, it really wasn't an issue to be concerned with.  A few months after we started dating, we were at my place watching a movie, and she laid into me with the most incredible kiss I've ever experienced.  That's just how she is.  She's the most vibrant and sexy woman I've ever met.  

If I'm the brains in the relationship(debatable), she is most definitely the heart.  I'm not so great at expressing my feelings, but she can figure out what I'm thinking in a split second.  And I don't even have to guess what she's thinking.  She simply doesn't have any deception.


Well, I said all that to put our relationship into context.  Now to get back to why I asked the question.  She lives with her sister and her sister's husband, and draws disability, though it's because she has scoliosis.  Before it got bad, she had no trouble holding down a job.

Ironically, I tore up my back pretty badly not too long ago, and I've been trying to get on disability too.  At this point, she is more physically able than I am, which is saying a lot.  I used to be able to toss a 250-pound beef quarter over my shoulder without a problem.

Thing is, our relationship is hedging up against simple and incontrovertible financial issues.  Fact is, I may not be able to get on disability, and if I can't then I'm completely hosed.  And even if I do, she'll be stuck with a cripple for a boyfriend who can't even properly perform in bed, let alone do any heavy lifting for her.

Plus, her scoliosis isn't just going to go away.  I'd love nothing more than to pay for her to have surgery.  It's not for cosmetic issues, I could care less about that, but I just can't bear the thought of her back one day crippling her as much as mine has me.

As it is, that will happen one day.  I won't be able to help her with it.  But the thought of me losing her...I'd rather be shot.  It would be a lot quicker and easier.  I just don't know how we could stay together and support each other.  


What would you do?

Basically 3 years ago I met the love of my life. Like seriously, head over heels, sparks flying, the-grass-seems-greener-and-the-sky-seems-bluer type love shit. He was an international student studying at the local university, and dealt pot on the side to make cash. He was the most incredible boy I have ever known, and he was crazy about me too. He opened me up to an entire world full of new ideas, and made me happy to be alive. Coming from a childhood of mental disease, depression and social isolation, this was a serious turning point in my life. He inspired me find happiness, purpose and ambition. He basically changed my life. We were a perfect couple. In the three years we have been together we have never even had a real fight. I think we had an argument once, and it lasted all of 15 minutes. 

But alas, all good things must come to an end.  About 8 months after we started dating, he was arrested and charged with distribution. This wouldn't be a huge deal for a citizen of the country, but since he was just here for school, he was told that after the court proceedings finished he would be deported and not allowed back in the country for 10+ years. 

Fast forward to the present day, and while we have been living with the reality of him leaving for over two years now, it has just finally sunk in that it is actually happening. He leaves in 4 weeks and I have no idea if I will ever even see him again. Given that we're both broke-ass college students, we don't exactly have the money to pay for plane tickets. We would marry each other in a heartbeat, but he is not allowed in my country, and his home country has virtually no market for jobs in my field. Moving somewhere else together is dicey given that a criminal record makes travelling much more difficult. Given that we have no foreseeable future together, not for lack of trying, we have both kind of mutually decided that we will have to break up. Commence waterfall of tears onto my keyboard. But really, I don't think either of us has stopped crying long enough to breathe.  

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Breaking up due to something completely beyond your control? How did you deal? I feel like this is so different from a standard break up, given that there are no harsh feelings or events which lead to it. 
The universe, for some reason, just kind of saw fit to rip up the foundation of my happiness by the roots, give it a good shake, and then toss it across the Atlantic Ocean.

I'm the quiet type and I don't open up easily but since we started dating, I've been talking more. However, when I do start talking, he either interrupts me or isn't really listen at all. English is my second language too so if I wanna say something, it takes me a little longer to explain than it would to a native speaker. So when I'm trying to say something long, I feel like he is bored so I usually just skip the story. But that isn't the issue here. It's really annoying when I tell him something and he'd just forget it the next day. 

For example, last night we were at dinner and there was a song playing in the background just when we were leaving. I told him I knew that song and was singing it on the way back to the car. While we were walking back and while I was telling him that I knew the song, he was texting the entire time (the car had broken down and he was probably texting someone for help). So I didn't bring up the song again since he was texting. Today, I send him the song saying that's that the song from last night and he's like how the hell did you find that song. It pissed me off and I said that I told him I knew the song last night. To this, he goes, didn't mean you knew the title of the song. I can sing like 50 songs and not know the title or the singer! That wasn't the point I was trying to address there but he was all about trying to prove me wrong instead of seeing how I was telling him that he doesn't listen to me when I'm talking.
Is this going to be a problem in the future? Should i talk to him about this or just let it go this time? Ive always thought he's a terrible listener since we started dating. Is this a red flag I'm ignoring? Any suggestions?

12116,Relationships,2qc9za,"She and I met my sophomore year of high school- she’s one year ahead of me. I’m a senior now and she’s in college, so this issue has been weighing on me for a while. When we met, I thought she was kind of evil and very bossy. She was the captain of the team we were both on, so she maintained a distance from the other members. Over time, we warmed up to each other after finding out that we have a very similar sense of humor and several common interests. We have a relationship built upon sarcasm and being jerks to each other- and it’s great.

Eventually, I developed a crush on her, unexpected because up to this point I didn’t know I was bisexual. We spent more time with each other by my junior year we would flirt with each other all of the time. I tried to hide how I felt, but I’m sure it was obvious. I held doors for her, did everything to help her no matter what, bought her a thoughtful gift that she loved, favored her over everyone else on team. We even slept in the same bed and cuddled on a field trip. People always assume that we’re dating. She always jokes about going on dates with me and having sex with me. Eventually, she left for college and after a few months I started to almost get over her. But when she came back, it all started up again.

Now, she’s back again. I asked her if she wanted to hang out later in the week and she said yes, I just don’t know if she’s expecting me to invite other people, or if I should anyway. We’ve hung out by ourselves before and that was really nice, I think she enjoyed it too. I’m not out of the closet and she’s never had a boyfriend nor talked about any crushes. I had to get her her prom date because she has no guy friends whatsoever and she’s never expressed interest in any guys either.

Here’s my problem: she is severely lacking in the empathy department. She is entirely self absorbed and so conceited she has a skewed perspective on pretty much everything. She thinks she’s god’s gift to mankind, and I’m worried that if I tell her how I feel, she may mock me. She might stop speaking to me. She’s selfish, conceited, and more than a little evil, but my life would be so much less colorful without her in it. I don’t want to experience that. I really hope she likes me, but I'm so uncertain.

I have been with my boyfriend for nearly a year, after being best friends (&amp; fwb) for 2 years. I love him dearly and can't see myself with anyone else. We moved in together fairly quickly, but its been great and we really live together well. In the beginning of our relationship, I was cautious, I have a daughter by another guy and she obviously comes first. He completely understood and waited for me to 'get my shit together' from my previous relationship. He knew what he was getting into, being the father figure and helping me raise her. 


The only time we seriously argue is when its about girls from his past try to contact him (calls, text, social networks) and the only times I find out, are when we are together -mostly laying in bed looking or watching something on his phone.

So this happens and I kinda flip out. Only because its happened more than once, I'm hurt, &amp; I was also told he explained to this girl they will not be buddy-buddy. I leave the house to catch my breath and come back within 15 minutes. When I get upset I want to talk it out...but like the other times, he completely shuts off and the only reaction I can get it a blank stare. He finally starts to talk, but deflects everything and somehow is able to make me seem like the jealous girlfriend. ...yada yada. He eventually leaves and I don't see or hear from him for over 24 hours. He makes it home after going out with some co-workers and goes right to bed.

That morning, I get something out of him. He doesn't think our relationship is worth it and doesn't think he is getting anything from it. He tells me  he isn't ready for marriage, not wanting to expand our family, or anything else that he knows I am one day wanting. (We have had this discussion, and this is some things I am willing to sacrifice for our relationship.) Then declares we should split up. BUT I am great, he loves me and my daughter, &amp; as much as it sounds like it, I am not the problem.

It was more or less decided that we would like to try again, but she needed space first. So I gave her that. And I have come to conclusions about myself. The issue being...coming back here for her, and not having a car yet, I am reliant on her. Alot. She is stressed with school and work and wanting time for friends and for me. I only work, and am not getting that many hours at the moment.

She is a wonderful girl and the love of my life. I'm gonna say this, but I don't want negative replies for opinions on young relationships. We have even been planning to get married. This all came to a head on Thursday. While our official one year anniversary was going to be the following Saturday. With me not doing much but work, she feels obligated to be with me otherwise she feels responsible for my lack of direction at the moment. I'm realizing that I need to be working more on myself personally, and for what I can make of myself...to provide and be a man for her. Someone with direction and motivation. I need to work more on me and rely less on her. Thus removing the pressure and making us both happier.

I'm proud of her independence, and I need my own too. But we can't just be over like this. So I need to convey all this in a way to not pressure her to come back, but to make her see that we can go back to being us, and I will be working more on myself and less on being consumed in her. I need to know the best way to do this. I have given her her space. Didn't text or call at all since the breakup 4 days ago, and now she has texted me telling me she is off on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday if I still wanted to get dinner and talk some more like we decided to do during the break up conversation. Opinions, advice, perspective? Thankyou.


TL;DR: We broke up because I unintentionally put pressure on her, and she needed space, and to not be responsible for anyone but herself. I realized my mistakes, and am already in the process of bettering myself and finding direction in life outside of her. I want her back, to be better, and we can both be successful in this relationship.","My [19/f] girlfriend broke up with me [19/M] saying she needed space, I've made some self realizations and we are having dinner this week.",0.0,False,0.0,14.0,1426543890.0,/r/relationships/comments/2za6kn/my_19f_girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_19m_saying_she/,Romantic

12129,Relationships,3dz8pp,"Background: this girl, we'll call her Megan, and I had sex on a really random night a little under a month ago. We live near each other and she's leaving town for good early next month. Neither of us are looking for a dating relationship, obviously, but it is still really unclear on whether she's interested in following up our little get together with another adventure in the bedroom or if she's just stringing me along. 

Now, to last night's story: after she asked me to go to breakfast with her and a couple of friends yesterday morning, I ended up bringing up a big concert that was happening near us (like an hour and a half drive away without traffic) that night. I figured it would be cool for her to be able to experience the venue (which is very nice and unique) before she left and I wanted to gauge her interest in a potential follow up excursion to the bedroom. 

We all decided to go with some other friends of ours. On the way to this venue later that day, we were in a packed car. She and I sat next to each other in the back and we cuddled up a bit, my hand around her shoulder, her head resting on my shoulder/arm, you know the deal. We talked for a bit and eventually stopped to get alcohol. I ended up buying it for her and her friend. In my mind, things are going well. We drank together and eventually made our way into the venue. 

She and I danced on and off together for the first 45-ish minutes that we were there. Then, seemingly without reason, she goes and dances with another guy from our same group that neither of us knew before the car ride up and she proceeds to dance with him for the rest of the night (over three hours). They looked like they were getting a bit touchy-feely, but it wasn't any dancing I hadn't seen typically before. I didn't talk to her for the rest of the night because I feel like I was reasonably upset and put off by this. 

On one hand, she and I don't have any sort of committed relationship, so one could say I have no right to be upset, but on the other hand, we have sexual history, I invited her to this concert, we cuddled a bit in the back of the car, I bought her drinks, and we were initially danced together when we went into the venue. She doesn't have to dance with me because of that, but if she is going to dance with me, it seems like a pretty bitchy move to spurn me for another guy after 45 minutes. 

They ended up in the back of the car on the way back home where she and I were on the way up to the venue. She pretty much slept the whole time and it didn't seem like they were doing anything, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. When we got back home, we all went our separate ways, but she did offer to pay me for the drinks I bought her. I told her we could figure it out later (it was super late at night and I really didn't want to talk to her). I do plan on having her pay for the drinks. 

She sent me a good morning :) text earlier today and I haven't replied yet. I'm leaning towards getting the money from her then cutting her out of my life completely, even before she leaves in a few weeks, but she's just so inconsistent with the message she is putting across. We're not that close at all, so that kind of text is not a norm between us or anything like that, but after the way she basically ditched me for another guy, I just get the impression that she's keeping me around as an option/stringing me along.

12130,Relationships,38gwne,"I have been with this girl 2 years, 4 months and nearly two weeks. In that time we have never gone an especially long period without seeing one another.

We met at school, and after a week or two (I really get on with her parents) this was the routine; I would go home with her after school every day. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I would stay there for dinner and leave at 10 pm. On Saturday it would be the same, only I would arrive earlier. Tuesday and Thursday I would go home at 5-6 (when her dad finished cooking) and Sundays I either wouldn't see her (for a while I would see my father on Sundays, but thankfully that has long since stopped happening) or she would come to my house.

This was the routine for the majority of the relationship. During school holidays it would be the same, except I wouldn't always go and see her Tuesday/Thursday (due to anxiety and depression I really hated leaving the hose for a while and a couple of hours didn't always seem worth the walk). I haven't had, or wanted, a very active social life outside of her. We sometimes would hang out with friends, and I've played a few D&amp;D sessions without her, but most of my social life is just me and her.


That started to change when I left school due to the aforementioned psychological issues. I would pick her up from school, always on the main days and sometimes (most of the time) on Tuesday and Thursday. Then my mother joined AA and to support her I dropped off the Mondays so that she could go to meetings (my little sister is at cheerleading Monday and Tuesday nights, my parents recently separated and we can't leave my little brother, the youngest, alone) and so that my girlfriend could get more revison done for her exams. I also need to stay home both Tuesday and Thursday now to support my mother by looking after my siblings. This is a necessity and not something I begrudge my mother at all.

But it does mean I'm down to seeing my girlfriend three days a week instead of 4-6. Which is bad enough on its own (we both absolutely hate being away from each other). It also means we have a three day period where I won't see her at all; before now that was the absolute longest we had ever been apart. 

This week I haven't even seen her at all and won't until Saturday; she has exams all week and needs to revise, so her parents asked me not to come around while she's this busy, which is understandable. 

And if I'm lucky I might finally get a sodding job soon, and god knows how often I will be able to see her if I'm working monday-friday throughout her holidays and school time. She's also going to be away for weeks at a time during the summer, for a college program and a holiday in Paris. 

The only silver lining is that after these exams I will finally be able to spend nights with her. But I've just been seeing less and less of her and it's only going to get worse. We are literally 95% of each others social lives, and being away from her so much is killing me (and she's said the same). I get depressed and lonely when I can't see her and also incredibly bored and apathetic. I don't want our relationship to suffer from this lack of time, either. How can I keep it all working?

**Tl;Dr: after a couple of years of near-constant presence my girlfriend and I are forced to spend less and less time together. How do I cope with this, and keep the relationship running?**

12132,Relationships,34dt0v,"My boyfriend is extremely wonderful and I love him, he has two sisters in their early 20's, about 21 and 22 I think.  I've met them a few times, and we've chatted on skype a few times as well, they are extremely gorgeous and friendly.  No problems with them whatsoever.

So my boyfriend and I are visiting his family's home for a week when this happens.  We spend a few days hanging out, I've met his family before, they are all really nice and wonderful. Nothing weird at all.

One thing that caught me extremely off guard was when we were in a sauna naked with his two sisters.  It was extremely weird and offputting, it like came out of no where and I wasn't expecting it at all.

It was me and my boyfriend in the steam room, we were both naked, and I was relaxing on his shoulders.  It was very sleepy and comfortable, and then his two sisters walk in and join us.  I wasn't expecting it at all.  They had said they would join us soon but I figured either they weren't serious or something else was up because I didn't expect they'd walk in when we were naked but they were naked too.

So my boyfriend is just casually chatting with them, and I'm sitting there silent and terrified until its all over.  Later onwards I confront him about this.  I tell him if something like this is normal for him, and I let him know I was extremely uncomfortable.  At first he though I meant I was uncomfortable because I had been seen naked by them, but I explained to him I was much more uncomfortable by *him* being seen naked by them.  He was a little surprised at first, then told me that I had absolutely nothing to worry about and they were his sisters and nothing like that would ever cross his mind.  Apparently growing up together, it had never been much of a big deal to him.

But he promised me if we're ever in the sauna together and I'm around, he'll try to make it so we're all wearing clothes.  I accepted but I still feel something's off about it and uncomfortable that the whole thing happened.

I'm not sure if I'm overreacting because its just bare skin, there was no sexual context at all, but I can't shake this jittery feeling off me.  There was nothing else at all in the way they acted that seemed suspect to me, we all went on picnics and to restaurants and had good fun. We even all smoked some cigars together, and I didn't even know he smoked!  It was a fun holiday, but its just this one thing I haven't been able to shake off my nerves, and I'm not sure if I should bring it up with him again because as far as it seems, we've already settled it.

We have good times and bad and this past week we went on a vacation to New Orleans. We (or I) had a blast until the very last night of the vacation when we got into a drunken fight and said somethings we shouldn't have. Went to bed on the couch and woke up to take the long plane ride home. 

Once we got home, I was told that the fight we had ruined the entire vacation for her and that it was the fight that made her realize that she doesn't love me anymore. This devastated me. We have stupid fights here and there and I didn't think this was a big deal.  She told me that when she saves up enough money she is moving out and that she wants me to leave her alone until then. 

Naturally I responded by telling her that one fight should not define the entire vacation or our relationship, but she said she was looking at this trip as a time to rekindle things and the fight just ruined everything for her.

12136,Relationships,3at9su,"So my boyfriend and I met under funny circumstances. He was one of my teachers at college (in the UK, so last two years of high school), although he was a newly qualified teacher when I was in my last year, so it was only for the last year. It was a running joke all the way through school how much of a crush I had on him, actually!

After I left school, we kept in touch, because we'd always had a lot in common and he was thinking about going back to university to complete his masters. He ended up starting at the same university as me when I was in my second year, we went out for coffee a few times and the rest is history!

I've always been a shy and self conscious person, and so I haven't told any of my friends from college about us for fear of being talked about. The way we met is something that we also try to keep quiet at university. The reactions when people find out are quite mixed. Generally a typically British 'oh, alright', but there have been a few times when people have found out, and it's become the butt of jokes or the only topic of conversation (I have been told that I'm living the porn star dream, that he's a paedo, and once we were at a party when someone we didn't even know came up to him and asked him 'so, what's it like fucking a former pupil?'). This has made it even harder for us to take the next big step - telling my parents.

A word about my parents - they're strict as hell. I have a curfew when I live at home, boys aren't allowed upstairs (even to use the bathroom) and my mother gets offended if I don't tell her every single aspect of my life. I used to find it almost endearing, but now I can't deal with having to hide such a big part of my life from my family. I'm going to be doing a year in industry next year, and combining the stress of making my relationship long distance and keep it quiet from my family is really starting to get to me. Because of the student loan system in the UK I am financially dependent on them. I'm also barely hanging on to my grades as it is, and I don't think I will be able to get a job without it badly affecting the outcome of my degree.

12138,Breakups,2cd15s,"Quick background on us, because I need to vent as well.  The first seven months of our relationship, I thought he was the sweetest, most wonderful person.  I thought he loved so much and I loved him (still do).  

It all went downhill after month 7, though.  He started blowing me off and neglecting me, getting mad at me and yelling at me whenever I was sad and wanted some more affection and time.  He was pushy about sex to the point where I often felt devalued and disgusting after I would give in.  I'm not needy.  His friends always told him that he had the chillest girlfriend because I've always been more than okay with him going out and doing his own thing with his friends pretty much every night.  I barely asked for any of his time, I was just sick of being a glorified booty call at 2 am when he'd come home wasted and want to fuck.  Towards the end, that was the only time I'd see him. He told me he wasn't sure if he wanted to commit to our relationship anymore, but that he loved me more than anyone in the world and I needed to stay in his life.  And that I needed to stay while he figured it out and that I'd better not hook up with anyone else.  

I'd cry to him and ask him why he was doing this to me, why couldn't he either give me more love and affection or let me fucking leave already.  I cried every day for a month and he knew and nothing changed.  A girl at his work is moving next week.  A few days ago, they were all at a party and she started crying about how much she'll miss everyone and he held her and comforted her.  And then decided to throw her a surprise party that cost $200+.  The party was last night.  That's when I decided I couldn't fucking do this anymore and ended it.  I cannot stop crying, every inch of my body hurts, it's hard to fucking breathe.

Sorry.  That part doesn't have much to do with the dog but I needed to get that out of my head.

He treats his dog the same way he treats me.  He's a super loving hound dog who loves to run, and he keeps him cooped up in this 1 bedroom apartment, rarely takes him for walks, etc.  He will go to work for an 8 hour shift, and then go out immediately after without coming home first.  He'll only go home the next afternoon, so he leaves this dog at home alone for 20+ hours on a regular basis.

He is such a good, sweet dog.  Obviously a dog needs to use the fucking bathroom during these 20 hours, and he tries so hard to hold it.  I've come home with him to his dog walking around clenching his legs because he has to go to the bathroom.  Every now and then, he can't hold it and pees and poops in the apartment and my boyfriend would yell at him until he was cowering.  What do you expect when you leave a dog in a tiny space for almost a full day?

My boyfriend does the same thing with his dog that he does with me; insists that he loves this dog, this dog is so important to him, makes excuse after excuse for his behavior, but never changes a single damn thing and then it's always the dog's fault when he begs for attention or starts whining or has an accident in the apartment.

Okay here goes, I (m22) met this girl (f23) back in high school and we started dating.....we dated all through college until junior year when she went to her home country over the summer in Europe and started growing distant. I noticed straight away and called her out on it when she came back and she told me she needed some space to think.


 Finally she told me that I had become neglectful and had taken her for granted and she couldn't handle it anymore. We broke up, I didn't give up and worked on the things I knew I had done wrong. After 3 months we admitted we still loved each other and we got back together.  We had an amazing year and things were going perfectly, until it was time to go to Europe again for the summer. Prior to her leaving she told me she loves me so much and that I shouldn't worry cause things are different  now.  


4 weeks In to her vacation she starts becoming distant again. We talked on skype and she told me that she doesn't think raising kids with me will be easy and that she's scared shitless of feeling like an outsider in the future.  I am a Muslim from the middle East and she is Christian. I am not very religious and would never impose my beliefs or my ways on her. I love her for who she is and would never change her for the world. However I grew very impatient when I noticed she was ignoring me while she was there and was going out with her friends. She barely had time to talk to me and towards the end of her trip would only spare 10 minutes for me before going out and I'd have to wait till the next day to talk to her. 


She said she knows she will feel differently again when she's back home (in the middle east). I couldn't wait seeing as I felt like I was being put on  the shelf while she decides if she wants to be with me or not. 

I broke up with her and told her that I was doing it as I could not wait around for her to decide if she wants to be with me or not. She said she's sorry she hurt me and that I deserve to be with someone who won't doubt her future with me. She also said she knows she will probably regret what she did and how she's feeling for the rest of her life. She's back now and I still haven't broken NC...... I love her so much and I know she still loves me....... We are great together when she does not go back to her country...... Is there still hope or am I fooling myself? If so what should I do?  Do I break NC first? Or wait for her to do it? 

P. S. She has always been a person who worries a lot and always thinks the worst will happen. She said she doesn't know if she can handle all the difficulties that will come up in an inter-racial marriage and that she will always be stuck between her family and I.

12141,Relationships,1h7rw8,"Me and my boyfriend have only been together 2 months, and the relationship is making me feel a bit down. First off, our only means of communication is texting! As we are also going long distance for a year I've suggested that we should start having phone calls which he didn't really seem keen on. On top of that, as of late (last 3 weeks) the communication is drying up, with not only the time between texts increasing but most conversations he will just stop replying with no explanation. 

I don't like to feel clingy in relationships, and also hate confrontation. I'd hate to make him feel uncomfortable, so if he doesn't reply to me I don't mention it. We've gone from texting most days to 3-4 days a week, with him nearly always not replying out of the blue mid conversation. He'll text me first, it'll go back and forth a couple of times and then it'll stop completely. Last time I sent him a text first he ignored it completely. The strange thing is though, if I distance myself he instantly starts texting me normally for a couple of days without ignoring me, and before he left he made a point of adding me on skype but we're yet to have a call on it.

I don't expect constant communication one bit and don't send more than 2 texts in a row ever, but I feel as though he could say that he has to go or whatever if he doesn't want to talk to me.

So I suppose the point is, should I confront my boyfriend on this? I don't want to seem confrontational or clingy, but I don't feel like a true relationship can be developed through text messaging, especially if he doesn't take the time to reply any more. And if I do, how can I do it in a calm and reasonable manner that doesn't seem as if it's a personal attack?

12142,Infidelity,2lfb0l,"I will try to keep this short. Approximately 2 years into our relationship my SO and I took a 9 month break while she studied abroad. After the 9 months we got back together and have now been dating for 3 years.

While she was abroad she met, became good friends with, and hooked up with a guy we will call R. The first semester after my SO and I got back together we went out to a bar and R was there. My SO and R spent several hours chatting and I got jealous. I told my SO I was ready to go and asked her to go with me. She did not leave, I waited for an hour and then said fuck it and left. 

About 30 minutes after I left the bar she called and came to meet me. Immediatly we got into a fight. The end result was that I was jealous, that I would prefer she didn't spend time with him, but also that I knew they were friends and understood she would probably still want to hang out with him. She agreed she would still be hanging out with him.

That is a summary; here are the potential RED flags in list form from the ensuing year.

- our sex life went from great over the summer to once or twice a month after school started.

- The only time my SO would speak of R was when other girls would bring him up. The topic was always how amazingly hot and dreamy R is. My SO would always jump on that wagon.

- My girlfriend never told me she was hanging out with R but she was. I would find out from pictures, texts, and sometimes friends would mention they went to parties R would throw with my SO. I also have a strong suspicion they were hanging out without my knowledge regurarly.

- R gave my SO a graduation present, which was weird to me since she literally never brought him up to me but they were clearly still communicaring.

- The night of our graduation I called my SO and to ask where she was and if she was coming to the party I was at. She did not answer but sent me a text saying she was at another house and talking to a friend but she would come soon.

 I decided to go and meet her so I started walking towards the other house. When I was close I called again and she picked up. I said I was getting close and would walk with her. Immediatly she said no you don't need to come, really I will walk overy very soon. Well it turns out I was only about fifteen feet away, and of course the friend was R.

These are the mitigating factors in my mind.

- My SO was depressed during this time and that could explain the lack of sex

- My SO could have truly just been friends with R but knew it would upset me that they hung out so she didn't say anything.

- We slept in the same bed most nights and I don't know where  she would have had time to cheat.

- She never stopped saying she loved me.

Anyways, this all happened almost two years ago. Since then  we have moved states and moved in together. The sex has slowly picked back up (along with my SO's emotional well being). I had basically moved on from my paranoia until this weekend. My SO got a snapchat with R in it. That night she started texting him, and has continued for the last few days.

My paranoia has gone into overdrive. I have to admit I even snooped on her phone. All the texts are friendly and at worst a tiny, tiny bit flirty. 

I guess I just want a way to get over this. I just want to ask my SO what their relationship was exactly and what it is now. I want to know if they were hanging out two years ago even if it was just as friends. I just want it out there so I can make an informed decision instead of this crazy speculation.

Then again I know that approaching my SO about it would drive her crazy, and would certainly feel like me being controlling and a little crazy bringing up such long gone events that most likely were nothing. 

Is there any graceful way I can bring this all up? Or should I just accept I am being paranoid and let it go?

12144,Breakups,1n0bq4,"Hi there relationships.

I've posted about my troubles here before, you can have a nosey if you're intrigued, but basically how it ended is that we broke up last week. We would have been together 2 years this week, and we've been living together for a year almost. In my mind we are still together because I just can't face the fact that i'll be moving out next week, and in the mean time we are still sharing a bed and basically acting like roommates. We were filming a tv show this weekend at our house, so we HAD to interact and be friendly.

My question is, how the heck do you deal with the fact that I KNOW exactly how i'm going to feel when I leave, and it's going to be horrendous? We have a cat together, she's my baby and I love her so, so much, but technically she's his and she's staying with him (he needs her more than I do). I also love his family, and it sucks that I won't see them again or even get to say goodbye.

I know it's for the best, I know it'll get better with time, i've been through a breakup before and came out the other side for the better...but I also know how painful it was, how I was massively depressed for months, put on lots of weight, and couldn't escape the reality; when I was awake I would just be in constant pain, when I slept I had night terrors. There was no escape, and I know it'll be worse this time because I still believe we're meant to be together in the long run.

He says he'll be miserable, and I believe him because I know what he's like. He's going to lose weight, become depressed and close himself off of love unless we get back together later on. The reason for the breakup are mostly his issues, but I have some too and we just can't be together right now.

So please give me some advice! I love him so much....but I know what needs to be done. We have some debts together (power bills, etc.) and just got a new flatmate. What things make it easier? What do we tell the flatmate about me leaving? She moved in thinking she'd be living with both of us (so did we) but now i'll be moving out. (Also, i'm moving out to go back home, staying in the same city would be too painful and I just lost my job, so I have no ties here. He has a good job, family and most of the big items of furniture are his.)

I have no idea how to deal with this. I just got out of depression, so I don't want to fall back. I'm keeping busy, catching up with friends, but I can feel myself slipping. I woke up at 11.30am and have just been watching episodes of 'House' instead of cleaning/doing things I have to do.

Thanks!

12145,Breakups,2gj685,"July was a strange month. I got accepted into graduate school out of state after being on a waiting list all year (I didn't think it was going to happen), got fired from my job, and ended up breaking up with my girlfriend all within the same two week span. I am in my second week of grad school, and I am having trouble adjusting to all of this change and coping with the stress. 

**SOME BRIEF INFORMATION BEFORE VENTING ABOUT BREAKUP:**

* For the first time in my life, I am living alone. 2 months ago I was in love living with my girlfriend and 3 friends.

* I do not know anyone except the people in my program, and it is a very small class. 

* I am so busy with school I barely have time to get out and meet people outside of my program.

* I am lonely as fuck. 

* I have anxiety, and I was seeing a therapist about things before I moved.

* I was fired for not following a company procedure that I was never trained on, and I pointed that out to HR that it is NOT in their employee handbook, but they still let me go. So how the hell was I suppose to know what to do if they never gave me the training, nor ANYONE else in my position?


I know I made the right choice breaking up with my girlfriend. But it hurts so bad. She and I lived together in my apartment (she wasn't on the lease), and we also worked together. We dated for 11 months. In the last few months, things became more and more hectic with her instigating fights, constantly micromanaging me, saying really mean/sarcastic shit to me and then would just say she was kidding, etc. In the fight that was the straw that broke my back, she started to pick on me for getting fired, saying are you sure you are right for this field? are you just going to get fired again? - continuously badgering me. Eventually, she said to me You have lots of problems! You have anxiety and OCD --.

At this point, I stopped her, and told her that I knew I had anxiety and that I was seeing ~~someone~~ a therapist, that she was being unsupportive of me, pointing a finger at me. I also told her I don't have OCD, and that it's offense she would say such a thing to me. Even if I did have OCD, how does that help someone who is going through mental health issues? It was just plain rude. 

I took some space, we didn't speak for a day or so. We end up chatting on the phone, I let her know she hurt my feelings and she attacked me again, saying well i wasn't that far off the mark (in reference to the OCD). No apology. No empathy! This type of combative fucking shit continued for another 20 minutes before I got fed up and dumped her over the phone. She wouldn't even meet me face to face to work through our problems or talk.


I feel so fucking numb. Moving, getting fired, not talking to my ex anymore, someone that I shared my life with for a year. Someone I wanted to marry (thank god I didn't). Immediately after the breakup, she removed me from facebook, texted me with an accusation that I was a cheater (I NEVER CHEATED!), and literally untagged herself from every goddamn photo, post, whatever. That hurts. 

I want my friend back. I am feeling the loss and death of the relationship. I don't know how to properly grieve it. I want to cry and I can't I dream of her every night. It's usually me finding her random belongings in my apartment, small reminders. I am STILL to this day finding her hair on my cloths, even after washing and using a lint roller. 

I just want to be able to have some sort of resolution to the break up, but I feel there is none. When I went to tell her my feelings, she couldn't empathize nor give me an apology. I know logically I am better off, starting a new chapter, but my heart hurts.

So we've been dating for 4 months. She has been very clear that she is interested in me. And i have let her know the same. We have gone out a few times, she has stayed at my place and we have been intimate. We have talked about being honest with each other if we want to continue being exclusive or continue dating other people. She explicitly told me she was only interested in me.

She tells me how many men cat-call and flirt with her. Especially at work, she tells me a lot of men tell her inappropriate comments. Often I felt it was exaggerated and that maybe she was also a flirt that provoked that behaviour. But thats fine as she is a very attractive girl and thought nothing of it. This didn't bother me.

Then recently, she was showing me her new phone. I was holding it and exactly at that moment she gets a text form a dude saying, I prefer you invite me to a black on the rocks instead :). So playfully I tell her about it and how she is being solicited by this dude and that she now has a date. Suddenly her face changes and she becomes very nervous. I stare at her and she tries to explain and read me the text messages. Before she continues I interrupt her and tell her she does not have to do that. She immediately stops and puts the phone down. Afterward, the rest of the lunch was awkward and silent.

After a while I felt kind of upset and disappointed because probably I had this expectation that didn't seem to be true. If she was actively responding and accepting invitations to a drink, it meant she wasn't taking the exclusivity seriously. And thats fine, since were only friends at the moment and she can respond to whomever she wants. But I can't help feel not taken seriously, and I expected a little more sincerity from her.

Later that day at night, I told her how I felt, and that I thought the exclusivity wasn't there and we should back down a bit in the relationship. She took it quite heavily and told me she felt offended by how I was thinking of the situation. That it was a playful flirt and nothing real. So I need help in how I should have reacted.

Last month his mother was diagnosed with a few different things, I won't go into detail as I don't want my friends to discover this. He NEVER wants to talk about his mother or how he is feeling about it. He never brings it up to me. I tried asking gently but I realised that he just didn't want to talk about it, so I don't talk about it unless he brings it up which is rare. 


As a result, I don't know exactly how unwell or well she is. I've only met her once and it was briefly, so I can't really ask her myself. I know that she was in hospital last week but she's back at home at the moment. Myself and my boyfriend are at a college, so he's about 5 hours away from home, so he doesn't get to see her very often recently. 


In the last month, he has been very depressed. He doesn't want to do anything, go anywhere, see anyone, talk about anything. I know that he was depressed a couple of years ago due to his sister being very ill, mentally. He was on anti depressants and he self harmed at times. I'm worried that depression has returned in full force because his mother is ill. As a result of his depression, he has changed a lot. He is always in a bad mood and cannot see the positive side to anything.


I'm trying to be sensitive to his feelings and emotions but it's hard when he is becoming such a difficult person to be around. He is snappy and hard to talk to. I ask him questions and he'll just nod or shake his head or grunt. He's constantly biting his lips and shaking his leg and get's angry when I tell him to stop. He seems to take everything I say in a negative way. Two things that he keeps saying to me all the time are nothing ever goes well for me. and I'm never going to be happy.


Yesterday we had an awful argument because he kept being sarcastic to me. I told him that I couldn't deal with the way he was treating me anymore and that if it continued then I wanted to end the relationship. He went back to his room, and self harmed, leaving me feeling extremely guilty and like an awful person. 


I do not know how to deal with this. I am not happy with the way he is treating me and talking to me. I am usually a very calm and relaxed person, but I feel stressed all the time because I can't make my boyfriend happy. He is making me feel like shit because of how he is talking to me. I told him that he should go to the doctors after yesterday, and he told me that he doesn't want to tell his mother because she doesn't deserve the stress. 


He cried last night and told me that he's sorry and he doesn't want to hurt me but he can't cope without me. I offered to go to the doctors with him here and told him that he doesn't have to tell his mother, but he refused. 


I don't know how to help him and I don't know if I can deal with this for much longer. I love him and I understand that his mother being ill is making him upset but I can't deal with his coping (or lack of coping) methods. I know that without me he would crumble. He sometimes tells me that I'm all that he has and without me he would be nothing. I cannot break up with him, I love him a lot. Please help me.

Over time there were several times when there just seemed to be a lot of mixed signals from her which left me really confused. I remember in one instance, I was talking to another girl on the phone (trying to start a relationship) while she was elsewhere in the room due to an impromptu, when she suddenly took the phone from my hand and hung it up loudly saying that I was supposed to be hanging out with her.

In another instance, while flirting with a mutual friend, she started loudly complaining about something and actually (although playfully) slapped me to get my attention which led to an argument over what the heck was going on (and ending my flirtation with the other girl)

Years passed and we were both in other relationships and worked in different countries but maintained loose contact. Both of our relationships ended within 6 months of each other and we began speaking more frequently. She spoke constantly about me coming to visting her but when I finally told her I had decided to come she decided to visit me instead for Christmas, along with a couple of her younger relatives. Towards the end of her visit, the whole process of being around her really re-ignited my feelings towards her and she spoke about wanting me to fly out with her for another holiday elsewhere. She also spoke about how hot I looked when we hung out or how her girlfriends thought I was hot. 

On the last day I brought up the idea of exploring something more (somewhat awkwardly). This was a big mistake as I was then accused of manipulating her and selfishly bringing her here in the hopes of starting a relationship and that she regretted ever coming here in the first place. She also got a chance to meet my family while here and demanded angrily to know what I had told them about our relationship (I told them she was on a break from her relationship and that we were not dating). 

Being accused of masterminding something when she brought up the idea of coming over hurt much more than a simple no and I'm wondering if I've finally reached the end of the line. I'm really questioning why I need this relationship in the first place as walking away so many years ago would have saved me from coming full circle. It feels more and more like a case of wanting to have your cake and eat it too.
How do I end a platonic relationship without coming across as just selfish? It just seems to be more emotionally damaging than rewarding.

UPDATE 2: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1oydo8/update_2_my30f_mom_55f_wants_to_go_on_vacation/
My mom, sister, and I all work FT and don't take many vacations.  We also don't live close to each other and probably only see each other 2-3 times a year.  For the last couple of years, my mom keeps bringing up the idea of a family vacation in Hawaii, sending me travel books and other ideas about what we can do.  
  
Recently, my sister had a baby and my parents are over the moon in love with their first grandchild.  My mom flew out to help my sister for the first two weeks and talked to my sister again about going to Hawaii, being a babysitter, etc..  I went out to visit my sister about a month after and she suggested that me and my boyfriend and her and her husband go to Hawaii this fall.  At the time, I didn't know my mom had asked again to go to Hawaii, so when my sister said she wanted it to just be the four of us, I said sure.  My sister is generally not very keen on spending a lot of time with our parents.  She and her husband really only see the family once a year during Thanksgiving, though it's not due to bad blood or anything.  I think it's more of a boredom factor, since my mom is super sweet, but (like any parent) can be a bit tedious/boring to be around after a while.
  
My mom came down to visit me this weekend and I told her my sister and I were going to Hawaii this fall, since I realized she'd be even more hurt if she started seeing us posting pictures on Facebook of us on vacation.  She of course was upset and told me she'd asked my sister about Hawaii and babysitting earlier this summer.  I told her I'd ask my sister about it later.  
  
Yesterday, I IMed my sister and asked if we should invite our mom, but my sister said, I thought we agreed it would be just us.  At this point, I don't know what to do.  My mom is the best!  I love her dearly, but I also understand why my sister wouldn't necessarily want to have grandma with us for 10 straight days.  I just don't want her to feel hurt since she's been wanting to do this trip forever and now we're going but my sister doesn't want her to come.

The relationship ended on pretty neutral terms, since I never really made any moves or did anything (we mostly just hung out after school until we got picked up, generally with other people) and, obviously, I know I completely screwed up everything. Since we go to the same school, and my best friend is actually good friends with her, I still see her quite a lot, but I hardly ever talk to her except in a group conversation. I don't really know what else to add, but if someone replies with some questions I'd be happy to answer and hopefully give a better view on what's happening.

12154,Relationships,1l1h7t,"TL;DR I cut off contact with my extremely abusive parents 4 months ago. One of their abuse tactics when I was younger was social isolation, so I have no relationship with any of my relatives. They all live out of state anyway. I have one sibling [25M] who I can't trust and thus have very limited contact with. I do have several good friends, some of whom know the extent of my situation. However, I'm totally alone as far as any familial support goes. I'm desperately craving love and intimacy but don't know how to fulfill those needs. Friends and women definitely help somewhat but they aren't family. How do I move forward emotionally and learn to fill these holes?



Whenever I see people getting advice about their toxic parents, it's normally in the context of whether or not to cut contact with them. If it's not that, it's usually advice about how to deal with some sort of major problem, with several people inevitably saying you don't owe your parents anything, and there's nothing wrong with cutting contact. I rarely see people that have actually cut contact with their folks talking about it afterward. That's the situation that I'm in right now, and I'd appreciate some outside perspective.



I've fantasized about cutting contact with my folks since I was 14 years old. I always knew something was horribly wrong with my living situation. I felt like that before I even learned to speak. Good memories from my childhood and teenage years are extremely rare. My folks, between the two of them, practiced just about every form of abuse possible on me and my brother. Gaslighting, starvation, social isolation, playing games to see how often they could break my trust, and so on. The only two I lucked out on were physical abuse, which happened very rarely, and sexual abuse, which basically just amounted to exposure and occasional frotting on my dad's part and really didn't affect me that much. I know it could have been a lot worse. Anyway, I'm not trying to make this post a laundry list of complaints--I'm trying to demonstrate that my decision to cut them off was beyond justified. I can easily recognize that they didn't treat me as a son.



My brother is a different case. We both discovered drugs at the same time and both developed serious cases of polydrug abuse and addiction over a couple of years. However, I beat my addictions. I've been completely clean for five years. He hasn't been able to do the same thing. He was always more sensitive than me(read: needs more drugs to cope with pain), always had less impulse control, started in his mid rather than late teens, and did harder stuff that I never did, like heroin. He also tripped hundreds of times on LSD and other hallucinogens, which kinda burned him out. I love him a lot and he's always going to be my younger brother but I can't trust him any more. He's done several things to break my trust in him and the addictions to harder drugs really changed him like they do to some people. I don't enable him and I do still feel like he does the best that he can. He's just not very emotionally capable now, so we're not close--he turned out a lot more like my parents than I did.



The social isolation I experienced was something that affected my whole nuclear family, not just me and my brother. My dad was and still is in a rather extreme subset of Christianity that basically amounts to a cult. My mom followed him into it. Both were avid converts before I was born. As a result of the cult and his own emotional problems, I've only known him to have one friend his entire life. He comes from a big family, and they have a family reunion every year. All of them always go except us. Our family never went. My inlaws would stop by my house occasionally when I was much younger but they stopped coming by by the time I reached my teens. I don't know why. Maybe my dad treated them poorly too. I do know that we never went to see them. They invited me to the family reunion a few times when I was out of the house and old enough to go on my own but I never went because despite us being blood they are strangers to me now. I don't even know what four of my dad's six siblings look like. I wouldn't know how to begin building a relationship with any of them, especially when most of them have kids and lives of their own. Also, part of me is worried that they're just as crazy as my folks. As far as I know, nobody besides my brother and I know what my folks are truly capable of because they present such pleasant exteriors to the world. For all I know my dad's siblings could be much the same way.



My mom's family is absent. She doesn't really keep in contact with any of them and never has. I don't even know their names except for her one brother who was mentally ill and died from cancer a few years back. FWIW, she did allow a few closely monitored friendships with other kids my age when I was young, so I wasn't entirely alone and was socialized somewhat. Public school helped with that too, but I was severely depressed as a kid to the point where I didn't give a shit about making friends, so it took me longer than most to be socialized. I have no problems with socialization now.



I've never had a relationship with my grandparents. Both grandfathers died before I was born, one grandmother died when I was 6, and the other (the evil one, apparently, who I had very limited contact with) died when I was 12.



So that brings us to now. I'd been putting up with my folks until recently because, at the heart of things, I was deathly afraid to be without support. Another thing that my dad did was use his superior knowledge to entrench me in a lot of medium-high interest debt when I was 18 and didn't have the first clue about money. When it got to the point that I was really in over my head, he started giving me a little money every once in a while, but I quickly realized that it was just another power game to him. So essentially I was afraid of being ruined emotionally and financially and that was why I stuck around as long as I did. I kind of wish I had dropped contact with them a long time ago, but it is what it is.



Anyway. I realized one day last spring, around my birthday, that the only thing keeping me around them was fear. I saw in a flash of insight that I was incredibly unhealthy mentally for allowing people like that to stay in my life. I could see how their influence in my life was really damaging me, even though at this point I barely even spoke to them. Once I had that epiphany, it was like the decision had already been made for me. I went with my gut and went over to their house the day I had those thoughts. I told them they were not allowed in my life any more. I was incredibly angry and emotional and said some things that there's no turning back from. I also made some threats about what would happen if they tried to cross the boundaries I had set. I don't think that they'd ever seen me like that. I've never seen myself like that before, honestly. I'm pretty sure I really frightened them. Between their fear and everything hurtful that I said, I don't think that there's any going back. And that is what I wanted.



I haven't felt any love for either of my parents in years, so I thought that this final disconnect from them would be great for me. And in a way, it really has been. I finally feel like I'm in control of my life. I started dreaming again for the first time in a decade. Less than a year ago, I would get so depressed and sad that I could hardly think, much less care about anything at all in my life. Now I'm generally in a good mood because I stopped ignoring my problems and started doing the best I could to make my life worth living.



But that's the thing--up until this point, it already was worth living. Except for the debt I have, I'm in a good place. I used to work out a ton when I was in my early 20s and I've kept the body from that. I started running three times a week over the summer and I've already worked my way up to being able to do an 18-minute 5k, which I think is decent. I'm physically healthy as can be. I have a couple fulfilling hobbies and several great friends. I get along well with most everyone. I have no problem dating or being intimate with women. I have a decent job and I never have to worry about something like being able to feed or clothe myself. I'm doing fairly well in a demanding college major that should, if everything works out, have me totally out of debt by the time I'm 35. Point is, my life is on track, and it's gotten a little better every day since I cut my folks out.



My problem is that I naively thought cutting my folks out would fix just about everything. It didn't. It certainly made my life better, but now I have a whole host of problems I wasn't expecting. I still have unfulfilled familial needs. No woman or group of friends can replace a family. I'm trying to get into the mindset of accepting that I never really had a family. But it's still extraordinarily difficult for me to be totally alone in the world. Before, even though my family was terribly abusive, I still had someone. Now I have my self-respect and no one. I'll never trade my self-respect for anyone or anything again, but I don't know how to get over truly having no one. I can see how that lack creeps into my feelings and affects my relationships with people. Because of my lack of family, I feel like need more than most people, more than what most people want to give. I have to watch myself to make sure that I don't fall into codependency or place unrealistic demands on my friends. The lack of supportive, loving, nurturing, intimate relationships is a damned heavy burden for me.  I'm having a hard time seeing the steps I can take that will lessen the weight or help me grow stronger.

I considered joining a church, but that's just not who I am. I'm not a religious guy, being raised in a cult has made me question so many things that I can't take religion seriously. I also did CBT based counseling for two years, which helped a lot. However I didn't like my counselor (free university student counseling) and I don't have the money to see another one right now, so counseling is out too. So...where to from here? Just take it day by day and see what happens? Is there even anything else I can do at this point?

She doesn't agree with any choice Anna makes, understandable Anna makes some shitty choices sometimes, but they were always made in her own interest that she thought would make herself happy and she learns from them. Her mother, just wants Anna to be something she's night, she wants her to be more like Anna's little sister, little mist perfect. They are not the same, and never will be. Anna's mom has controlled Anna every step of her life and Anna has no idea what real independence is because of her, she wants to but she can't escape her mother.




Me and her mother have always been in a good relationship. Hell I asked her if I could take Anna to prom before I even asked Anna! She said yes to that. She knows who I am very well. The only reason I think she might not like suddenly me is because one time I got too drunk and broke my friends wall. But I took responsibility for that, I owned up to it and then I never drank as much as I did again. I never get drunk like that anymore, I haven't since that accident. This I fear she doesn't believe. I have only been responsible with my life besides that one time. I mean I was even a security guard who multiple times found myself in heavy situations, and I've always protected people the correct way and have always handled everything great! Now thinking, another reason she may not like me is because my dad is currently in prison... And she knows that... But that's not like that makes me a bad person!

What matters is that we read each others minds and had a full conversation about without actually saying anything. Then we grew some balls and told each other we want to be together. That we're pretty much perfect for each other. So yeah all was fucking awesome! Then Anna *hints* at her mom about how she might feel about us being together and she just explodes! Being 100% against the idea. It tore Anna's heart apart, and it ripped mine up too when she told me. Anna said she needs to think about what's best here, date me against her mother, but have her mother resent her further and possibly ruin her living situation and never allow us to see each other, or we never be a couple and her mother continues to control her. I told her that I'm good at accepting things and that whatever she choose that I need her to choose what will make her happiest and be best for her, because that's what really matters and it's what I want for her. So yeah... I'm waiting for her to get back to me.

My boyfriend and I broke up on Friday.  We'd been together for about 14 months, and we had been struggling with some of our issues for the last month or so.  I am a super supportive SO, while he subscribes more to the challenge them to be the best version of themselves idea. That caused conflict for us, because I didn't always want to be criticized, and he couldn't moderate that well.  He wanted me to challenge him, but when I did he never took it well and my attempts only damaged our bond.

 When we first got together, it was the best relationship I've ever had.  It was something special.  And that's not just the rosy hindsight glasses, because I've had those experiences too and I have learned the difference.  He was thoughtful, kind and wonderful.  He made me feel loved and appreciated every day and our chemistry was indomitable.  

  Somewhere along the line, we lost that.  I feel like I made a lot of effort to compromise with him over the course of our relationship, but I didn't feel the same effort in return.  He has now admitted that he has been dealing with guilt because he didn't deserve me, or didn't reciprocate equally. This is true, especially in the last month or two. Somehow all the thoughtfulness and reciprocation became my job, and I don't know how that happened. 

My main source of difficulty is this: how can a person tell you that you are the most wonderful person, the best partner they've ever had, and yet not make the effort to reciprocate that partnership? How is saying that to me supposed to make me feel better when I am being left in spite of it? If I'm not worth the effort, then why tell me I am. It just seems like such a cowardly thing to say - to self-deprecate and pity yourself for your inadequacy rather than get off your ass and do something about it.  Am I wrong? How do I find closure after this? I put so much into this relationship, and hearing that confirmed while also being rejected is really messing with my head.

Background info: My boyfriend was previously engaged to another girl. They were together for a year total. She lied about certain things and manipulated him to make him feel obligated to marry her. It didn't end well but being the nice guy that my boyfriend is, he forgave her, she moved away, he helped her by paying for her stuff to be shipped to her.

12161,Relationships,1thl0t,"Let me give you a background. My wife and I have been married for five years. We were married just over a year after we met. I was a virgin and she was not. She was my only girlfriend before as well. I love her very much; she is my best friend. However, things have slowly changed and I'm not entirely sure why. 

I've been having a problem with attraction to other women. This isn't the normal testosterone-induced head-turn that goes no further. I will notice a woman now and again and have a desire to pursue her, and not just sexually. 

There are qualities that I feel are lacking in my marriage I hadn't realized I desired before, and my wife cannot fulfill them. I also wonder about all the adventures I missed, exploring and meeting different people,  including women. I don't feel happy anymore. I'm always depressed, angry, and resentful. Sometimes I resent the boundaries placed on me - I wish I was able to figure things out without hurting anyone. 

Here are just a few things that seem to be problem areas:

~ Sex is horrible; my attraction has waned greatly as she's gained weight and refuses to attempt being pretty for me.
~ She doesn't respect me
~ She's become withdrawn socially and culturally. I feel stuck, lacking adventure.
~ She doesn't like sharing dreams, romance.


Please give serious, nonjudgmental, constructive responses. Thank you!

12162,Dating,2xf1k3,"So a few months ago a guy from my past and I got back in touch. We never really dated, never slept together, so it was easy reconnecting and being friends. Lately we've been talking about our dating lives, breakups, etc. without getting into too many details, and recently we started joking about sex, including if we were ever to hook up. 

Then he started opening up to me about his sexual past... which I thought was a little strange because it blurs the lines from flirty chit chat to more actual intimacy...

So my question is, obviously the relationship is evolving past just friends, but is his revealing his sexual history just sexual tension, or is it more about trust and intimacy?

12163,Breakups,1i1yyv,"My girlfriend and I have been getting along fine for the past couple of months. A couple of months ago I questioned whether I could commit fully to marriage and family and we had a long talk about it and in the end, she decided she should leave me before things got worse. I broke down and told her that I love her and I don't want her to go and for the next couple of months things went fine.

Now a couple of days ago we had a brief fight. I don't think we are being passionate enough, like not enough affection or sex for my liking and so I brought it up in a way so that both of us could decide what we wanted to do. I didn't have any suggestions but I suggested that we spend some time thinking about it or for her to let me know if there was anything I could do to help.

She doesn't want to talk about it. Instead she got angry at me that I brought up this conversation again. Now she has said she wants to move out and is also saying that we are officially over. Others seem to think that I should go back and tell her that I love her and tell her how much I want her to stay, but I feel like I've already stated my position.

I asked her if she was OK with this situation. I said that I brought this up because I wanted to talk about it and fix things, not because I wanted to break up, but she has not talked about fixing things, instead she talks about breaking up, but I'm not sure if that is because I'm not pushing hard enough or what by telling her how I feel. I've told her that I love her and that she said she loved me when she broke down after the argument, so what's the problem? Yet the next day, she wants to break up.

Right now I'm not sure if I should bend or what. I've got major feelings for this girl but the way she's jerking me around (and can't handle a conversation about our love life) is really making me have second thoughts. I don't like the idea of trying to persuade her if she's already got her mind set. I feel like we've been through a lot in 2 years and she should know how I feel and I really do care for her.

12164,Dating,20g1lf,"So I just found out the girl I have been dating for the past 6 months has been in contact with her ex. Early in our relationship, she told me how he wanted to get back with her but she obviously declined. She has pretty much always been upfront with me. She could have never told me this and I would have never known. I dont really have any reason to not trust her.

They dated for almost 4 years, they broke up about a year and a half ago, and they were pretty close to being engaged before she found out he cheated on her. The person I dont trust is him for obvious reasons. Yes I have a ton of girl friends, and she has a lot of guy friends, so i know people can just be friends. The thing is, to her it may be an innocent friendship, but from his point of view it can be like Yes, we are talking again, now on to step 2!

I haven't confronted her about this because I dont even know if I should. I trust that she would shut him down again if that is what it came down to, but because they had so much history together, what if she starts to develop feelings for him again?

12165,Relationships,1vdjrz,"When i met my girlfriend and for the first6-8 months, i thought she was the love of my life and i was so unbelievably happy. We had such a good relationship, with communication and sex and things in common. We both respect each other a lot and always try and make sure that the other is happy with what we do that night and i feel like we both, at our core, love who each other are. I can elaborate more if need be.

The problems started with trust issues, and just coming out of the honeymoon phase in general. I still love her immensely, but when i'm around her now, i feel annoyed and anxious. About 2 months ago i started feeling this, and i hated myself for it. I wondered why it was happening and tried to fight the fact that it was happening. That only made it worse, and we almost broke up. But we didn't. I talked to her about it, and even though she took it hard, we came out the other end, and I think she understands what happened now. Even though i'm through that and i'll never hate myself for having feelings like that again, i'm still not sure if we're right for each other. 

We have really good times still, but there are still times where I feel annoyed and anxious and can't shake it, and it creates hard situations where I have to explain how I'm feeling and make her upset. She is always okay with it eventually, but the conversation is still hard, and has been happening often.

I guess i should say that I am a very anxious person, and tend to over think small things about her or me, and think that the relationship cant work because of this or that. This is my first real long term relationship, and i'm still learning I think. We talk a good amount about marriage and dating each other for a long time, and we're planning on moving in together next year.

Now that you know a little history, the problems i'm currently having are that i get frustrated with her a lot. I feel like she can't just be calm and love me, and enjoy time that way. She's very energetic when she wants to talk about lovey dovey stuff and its hard sometimes for me to reciprocate. She likes to act like a kid and get fake upset a lot, a game i used to enjoy but now i really dont. I know she means well with it and is just having fun, but it still makes me feel anxious. 

And theres the sex problem. She has a way higher sex drive than me, and she thinks its a big problem. She gets upset because many times when she wants to initiate sex, she feels like shes forcing me and gets upset or i dont want to have sex. So when we have sex, it's usually because i initiated, since she's pretty much okay having sex whenever and i'm not. I think she understands but she still get really upset every time this happens, and it stresses me out a lot.

There's one more thing. We go to the same college, and before she met me, she kind of dropped her old friend group for being druggies/assholes and she didn't want to do that anymore. When i worry about breaking up, i feel so horrible because i know how hard it would hit her, because she has mostly been absorbed into my friend group and she would most likely lose a big chunk of that because she wouldn't want to have to see me anymore. I feel awful just writing this because i really don't want to break up. I love her so much and i just want to feel calm and happy with her again, but i think im looking in the wrong places.

There are times where I feel like being with her is the right thing to do for me, and that i love her so much and this growing is good for me, but there are times when i want to give up too, and think that i'm just fooling myself. I don't entirely trust myself anymore because I've gone back and forth so much recently.

12166,Relationships,1scy14,"My fiance (31m) and I(25f) have been together almost 3 years known each other over a decade. I never met his brother (29m) until the first family holiday I went to. I know they were never close growing up but I have seen since I got with my fiance that hes tried to hang with him. But the brother would say sure contact me on say Friday we will hang, he would contact him with no response. In fact in three years besides family events they haven't even hung out more than a few times but one of these times was at my home. His brother was in a place without cable or unable to use said cable (I cant remember) and I let him borrow the first 3 seasons of a show I love dearly to entertain him, thinking I would get them back in a few months.

One of the times they hung out was for my fiance to help him move out from his wife. Im not sure how much to include here but she accused him of cheating, lying, and so on. He did admit to hitting her while drinking once. At first his family believed but then 2+2 got put together. Not soon after (less than a week or two) breaking up with his wife he shows up at my fiances work with a new girl asking him if he can find him weed through his friends. This really pissed my fiance off for many reasons, then he keeps getting text for him to find him pills when he gets a ton of pain pills already by a doctor. Then its revealed its a girl I know from childhood and the two semesters I attended of high school in that town. I thought she was married but turns out she just left her marriage too.

Next my fiance runs into an old friend who married an ex friend of the brothers. They reveal the reason the friendship ended was he was sexting nude pics with this girl he showed up with to my fiances work, that the friend tried to tell him it was wrong to do that and the brother flipped out. Then we find out he secretly sneaked this girl over to his parents house right before marrying his wife. The list goes on. Then the girl showed up to a family event showing her thong and 3 inches of crack apparently so that bothered people. Basically nobody supports the relationship, has no respect for it, are disappointed in him, and nobody really likes the girl at all. 

My fiance, his brother, and their cousin decided to have a drinking night at the cousins house. I dropped him off then went out with his cousins wife, she did not invite brothers new woman as she does not like her at all. When my fiance was saying goodbye to his brother he said brother I wish you hadn't of left your wife the way you did, I just can't respect her or the relationship. he had no idea the girl was anywhere near as it was outside in the dark. He had been wanting to discuss everything with him because we could tell he was picking up on people not loving this relationship.

The brother contacted my fiance the next day saying we need to to talk in person about what you said and my fiance replies thats fine set a date and time I've been wanting to talk to you too thats when he flips his shit on my fiance demanding he tell him right now via text to which he says no in person like you wanted. He refuses to set a date and time, he keeps thinking its all about his new woman, but it was about that plus him constantly taking money from their mom when he has a wonderful job, that many people are upset with him in the family, the list goes on and on.

 Then when my fiance stands strong he says if whatashadybaby told you stories from high school thats ridiculous and they arent true you shouldnt repeat stories from  high school! to which I got online messaged her and said I had not said anything about her, that I knew nothing about her from that time. Now this really pissed him off because he was telling her this whole time that the reason they don't like her is I must of been telling  stories but when i reminded her I moved away early and only attended two semesters that blew that out the water. But his dumb ass revealed during a text she cheated on her husband because he kept trying to guess what it was about and some other not so nice stuff shes done. Then he goes off on my fiance about me talking to his woman (she added me of fb when I first got one and she has initiated contact with me several times) to which my fiance told him don't accuse her of something and expect her not to defend herself the he cut all contact.

Then we start getting text about some dumb coat hes lost but accusing my fiance of taking. It was left at his parents house, his parents house is clean but it is crowded and if I lost something there I wouldnt even bother trying. Not to mention his room is awful. My fiance just didnt respond and the text came everyday for weeks. They would call him a coward, thief, fat, a pussy, threaten him. Now the brother is saying if he doesn't get his coat back he will destroy my dvd's that I lent him, that we will find them broken into pieces on my fiances car everyday until they are all gone. They work at the same place so he may do it there or when he is at my home. This show means a great deal to me, it got me through a super rough time, I had never seen it I just  bought it, I watched them with my mother who killed herself, I watched them with my now dead best friend, bonded with many friends over it, they mean a lot to me. I have games of this show, shirts, magnets, mugs, pens, pencils, a lot of shit. There is tons of stuff at his parents house of my fiances he could go after. I get between all the weed and pills he is popping he seems to have no common sense but this is just INSANE to me. Anytime I have been stolen from I just act like the person is no longer alive should I do that here?

He is threatening to do it either Sunday or Monday. What the hell do I do? Should my fiance report him at work if he does it? Should we call the cops if he does it on our personal property? Can we even do that? How can I ever sit in a room with him again after this? His mom will want me and my fiance to be the bigger people and just forgive and be buddies but I cant how do I get her to understand? Just any advice will be so helpful

I can answer any questions you have in more detail if you need that.

So, starting. I've met this girl on Tinder on Oct/2014, since then we kept talking. She was (is) one of the nicest girls I've ever met on my life, we share lots of common interests and with her I realized I could have an adult and mature conversation/relationship with her. 

We kept on talking during Oct., Nov. then went on a date. Everything was great - but no kisses on first date. But we agreed on seeing each other again. Which happened. We've met on Dec. and this month as well. Oh, and we kissed, she introduced me to ther friends, she invited me to spend New Years Eve with her and her friends (which was great). To be honest, I lost count of how many times we've met since the first time.

So, as you guys can see, we are not boyfriend/girlfriend yet. We like each other, a lot. I've told her that I really liked her and she said the same to me. Despite not beign bf/gf, we have a pact of not dating new people. So... (sorry, I dont know how to say that exactly in English) We are kinda... exclusive to each other. Oh, and we agreed we could be 100% transparent and honest to each other. We both were in a corrosive relationship before knowing each other, so we agreed that being open was the better way. So we could say when we found ourselves unhappy with something.

For both of us, this is perfect, since we get to know each other better and we are not in a hurry. She left a serious relationship circa 7 months ago, she had a quite controlling boyfriend, overly attached and extremely jealous - so we decided to go slow and easy.

Jump to this week. Everything was fine. We kept on messaging (we dont live in the same city, but it is close - 30 min by car). We didn't see each other, but kept on talking. **But** yesterday I messaged her in the morning (good morning, how are you?), as we always do. She read it, but didn't answer. Weird, because she was never the quite type. I've waited the afternoon, no answer. At night, the same.

I'm quite confused now. Should I text her again? Should I ask if everything is ok? Or should I stay on my own and wait for her? I'm not 100% with the fact of texting her again because I don't want to sound like her ex, I'm not exactly the controlling-type. But at the same time, I'd like to know if anything is going on...

I'm really sorry for the long post, I'm quite confused and sensitive now. I just... Had to put it out. Thanks for anyone reading this.

12168,Breakups,2o3wf9,"My now Ex-Girlfriend of eight years met our junior year of high school, went to the same college and live in the same city, although in separate locations, has said she has had enough and won't be coming back. 


Background: Our relationship in High School was a bit of a rocky one from the start, I went back and forth between my now Ex and another girl my junior and senior year of high school, before I finally realized that my Ex-gf was the one that I wanted to be with. Looking back at it, it was not the best way to start a relationship, and that back and forth caused some root issues throughout the rest of our relationship.  


When we graduated, I got accepted into a different school than she did and for the first semester of college we attended different schools. Spring semester she transferred to the college I was attending and ended up moving into the same dorm as me, but on separate floors. During the spring semester I went out with friends I had met my first semester there and she would often not attend because she was out with her roommate and her roommate's friends.  Some of these folks I went out with were other girls, and she started to ask if there was anything going on, which there was not, but she was still worried that since I was not actively asking her to go with me, that I must have wanted to appear alone in order to get with girls. This would become a reoccurring theme for all four years of college.


My fall semester of my junior year I ran into a girl I knew from my home town who was also attending the college I went to. She invited me out one night with a bunch of her friends to catch up. I ended up getting very drunk and went back to her apartment with her and cheated on my girlfriend. Knowing what it meant and that being drunk was not an excuse, I actively avoided telling my girlfriend about that night for as long as possible, but that did more damage than good, because the topic was not addressed for about a year and once it came out, she started questioning everything about our relationship and if I even loved her or if I was talking to other girls and anytime a girl would talk to me via Text or Facebook messages she would want to see them and want to know what was going on.  My argument was that she did not need to see my phone or my messages because nothing was going on, but this would continue to cause issues even up until the day she left.


Health issues:  I was healthy for the first half of my relationship with my girlfriend, before I came down with some mental health issues caused by an illness. For the first half of our relationship, we used to do a lot of things together and I was a very outgoing person. We used to see movies, go to dinner, trips, etc. but that soon started to diminish after I got sick. I started to have really bad anxiety about going places in general and pretty much turned into a hermit my last year of college because I was ill and did not feel like going out.  This turned into a severe anxiety disorder and escalated to the point of I was only comfortable going to certain places, such as work or the store.  She would ask if we could go to a movie and I would always put it off and say maybe next week. She would say hey lets go out to dinner tonight and I would say eh I'm not feeling well tonight, how about I cook?   I started struggling more and more with my issues and started to shut out friends and family, by rationalizing that I just didnt like to do things, rather than address my issues. 


We went from seeing each other daily when we were at College to maybe once or twice a week when we graduated.  She had gotten a place of her own so she would invite me over, but because of my anxiety and OCD issues, I was normally unable to stay the night, which cause another whole slew of issues because if it was a night where we had sex, she started saying that it really killed the mood and that she didn't like me leaving after it, so she wouldn't have sex with me unless I was spending the night. This put a lot of pressure on me as I am/was very attracted to her and sex was one of the things I felt I could still do without my OCD/Anxiety getting in the way. Our relationship went like this (only going to parties at friends houses, never going to the movies, never going to dinner, never going on vacations, never doing family events, me never moving into her house) for 5 more years. During that time I kept promising I would get better and that things would change and that we would do all those things she wanted once I was better.


Fast forward to Summer of 2014:  After barely being able to attend a friends wedding due to my anxiety issues, it was the straw that broke the camels back so to speak,  and I sought out a therapist. I was diagnosed with an Anxiety disorder as well as OCD. My OCD actually feeds my anxiety disorder so to speak, because I have obsessive thoughts that loop endlessly, which give me anxiety, and my way of coping with it was to not do anything, because then those things would never trigger. I did not realize how bad I was until I started seeing my therapist. I was able to see that for years, I had completely shut down everyone that had been close to me. I was able to see how destructive I had been and started working on ways to manage my issues.


3 months ago: She told me she had enough and told me that she can no longer date me. She said she can't go through seeing me suffer anymore with my problems anymore and can't deal with feeling rejected and unwanted and has put up with it for far too long and just can't be here anymore. She knows that I was seeing a therapist and she knew what I am trying to do, but she said that she has put me before her for the past 8 years and just can't do it and she needs to find herself. I just though it was going to be another fight that we would have and in a week or two she would cool off and we could talk about it, which did not happen.  


I have seen her twice, both at parties since we have the same circle of friends, and at the last one earlier in November I attended as I was bringing some things into the house where the party was being held, her phone lit up on the bench I was putting the things on, and she had a bunch of missed calls and messages from some guy. I got extremely upset over it, because it hadn't even occurred to me that she was already moving on. I excused myself from the party and went home, as I felt very uncomfortable being there with someone I am still in love with who no longer wants to be with me. She called me later that evening and told me that I acted childish for leaving the party like that and I should have talked to her then because she said that it was just a friend and that she's not seeing anyone or even interested in seeing anyone. I told her how I was feeling, that I felt like something was missing in my life, that she was a huge contributor to my entire adult life and that I needed her more than ever while I try to finally address all of the things that caused us issues and to improve my life. She said that she would always be here to help, but can no longer be my girlfriend because it would just be enabling me to not change and because she just can't feel like she has for the last 5 years and has become numb to our relationship and the person I've become. She told me to try to find happiness first and once I am happy again, that no one knows what the future holds. 


Future: I was invited to by her to Christmas party  before she split, my friends will be there. It's our annual Christmas party where all my friends give each other gifts. All my friends are either Married, Engaged, or with someone, and the party this year is at my Ex's house. I have a bunch of gifts that I purchased while we were together, that no really fit the friend criteria and I am unsure if I should still give them to her as I can't really return them.  And for that matter, should I go to the party? It will be the first holiday that we have not been together for and this has really been soul crushing while I try to deal with my anxiety and OCD issues as this has just made it worse to the verge of just feeling like giving up because of how hopeless I feel.

We've been together for 3 years and she has so many trust issues I don't even know where to start.

Just today we were at a bar together with some of my best friends. The bar closed early and we went to one of my friend's house, she works early so she asked me to drive her home. When I told my friends I would be back (I wanted to keep talking with them) she started bitching that no way I would be returning with my friends.

I, acting like a whipped asshole, didn't return to my friend's house and instead I got really angry and told her that what's the problem if I want to go back with my friends. She simply said that she doesn't like me going out to party without her (mind you this was definitely not a party just a small gathering with 3 of my closest friends).

I usually sleep at 3:00am and she sleeps at 1:00am at most. (she works morning, I own restaurants and bars so my schedule is more free and all over the place). Things from my side look like this: I'm the one driving and she lives far from my place and my close circle of friends. She drinks freely, I drive her home and when I can finally get the chance to go back to my zone and get a drink with my friends, she goes insane and starts fighting about anything that crosses her mind, (past, unrelated grudges and such). One week ago she even made me promise I wouldn't go back 'to party' without her.

As I've stated this is just today's fight. I could do a weekly post an all the tiresome, insane shit she makes go through. I love her but she's slowly driving me mad. I should probably do a lengthy, well-thought post of all the things in my relationship driving me mad. Don't even get me started about all the fights I've had to endure about myself talking with anything resembling a woman. They're all rooted in her deep trust issues and I don't see any solution.

So basically I have known this girl since highschool, but didn't have the guts to speak to her. Fast forward 3 years, I see her at University and we go from there. We start dating and the relationship is perfection, yes we have a few disagreements but we always made up and knew that we only faught because of how much we cared. 

When I asked her out she told me that her father would only accept someone of the same culture but I convinced her that if I met her father he would come around. (Her father basically wants a man of the same culture, with an education and a strong moral standing and according to her I'm all of those except for the culture clash). 

About 3 weeks ago, she broke up with me claiming that she has realised that there is no way in hell her father would say yes and that if we continued this relationship (we dated for about a year), it would only be harder in 3 years time to find someone else because at the end of the day family above everything. 

I'm not going to go into detail about the hardship it's the typical sleepless nights, reflection, etc. But the whole point of posting was to ask the question, should I contact her father and talk to him without her knowing, as to wanting to date his daughter? The reason why I'd say wanting not already have is for her own safety and the backlash she'd face if her father found out we already have. I was thinking something along the lines of telling him how I have known her since highschool and have really liked her and I think she likes me but I wanted to see if he'd allow it. I'd tell him about my education (Engeering degree) and about myself. But I don't know if she just fell out of love and said this as an excuse. 

If I suggested this to her, I think her answer would be a 100% no because she thinks her father would say no. Which is why I suggested that I tell him she has no idea that i'm speaking to him. 

Hope this all made sense.

We went out for a family drive after he came home from work, and by the time we were 5 minutes from home he said we're at a point in our relationship where we realize just how much we don't like each other. We're sexually compatible, but everything else... (he trailed off) Am I right?

I responded that something I don't like about him is that he's always telling me what I'm feeling or thinking, and that I disagree with his assertion, but that I guess I'm glad to know what he's thinking. 

My heart hurts. We argued today about money. He wants to spend it, and I say that we don't have any. We have ~10k in available credit, and that's all the credit we have. We have $400 in savings, and we have less than $100 in checking. Payday is this Friday when, after bills are paid, we'll have ~$300 to hold us over the next two weeks. 

He told me that I'm just bitching like we're broke when all he wants to do is buy a video game, a second TV, a computer monitor to replace his second screen with, and some other (IMO) bullshit. I responded that we are nearly broke, and that the available credit isn't cash in our pockets. It's like a nice big gun we could use to shoot at our feet. I also reminded him that we just spent all of our tax return on paying off our credit balance, and less than a month later he wants to get back into it.  Then I said I thought he is being very immature about money. He thanked me for being a check to his balance but that I needed to stop bitching like we're broke. 

I wanted to respond that I was just reacting to him coming at me with a list of things he wants to go out to buy right now, but there was no point. 

Otherwise, I like to do things together, and he'd rather be glued to a screen. He has always been that way, even before he asked me to marry him, so I don't believe he's glued to a screen to avoid me. But I would rather spend the afternoon playing cards together, playing board games, or just anything together. I like to hash out an issue or explore opinions, but he'd rather not argue and just be glued to a screen. So we end up mostly computing near each other, or sitting by each other watching TV shows that we follow or some movie. That's not fulfilling to me. 

I do like him. I like his sense of humor. He's very smart, and I particularly enjoy discussing things (politics, religion, current events) with him because he lends a very different perspective from mine. We have very different political views, and, until recently, we were of different religions (I was very religious when we met and married, he's been an atheist since he was a teen; I'm no longer religious) But that was never a problem for us; I valued him over my religion enough to agree to a life together. I don't like following him down his rabbit hole of wishlists of things to buy. I try to reason with him, and I end up getting mad or upset because I don't think he gets it, and I can't just humor him.

Our relationship is very nuanced, but I need a different perspective. I'm almost willing to right off his comment, but something tells me that could be very dangerous. I think we both want to make it work, but that's not the feeling I got when he said that. 

Our older two children heard him say that he wants to go out right now to get the things he listed to me, and the children expressed extreme interest in going out, too. That's the reason that we went out for a drive. It was a consolation prize for the kids, now that I think about it.

12180,Breakups,1q9pgg,"Three years ago, I[16F] met Z[19M] through his girlfriend of the time. Their relationship ended at her behest after only two months. I cut her off, as she became frantic and tried to burn down her apartment building.

Me and Z became friends mainly over the internet. He hit on me all the time, and I would play along... but, we fought a lot. This resulted in us cutting one another off multiple times. I mean, so many times that I cannot count. These fits lasted from a few days to maybe two weeks.

In November of 2012, only a year ago, he came to my house. I had not seen him since the first time I met him with that old girlfriend. I cannot explain how wonderful this evening was. I had never felt so compatible with anybody in my life. Although he never asked me to date him and we did not see one another for a while after that, our relationship became more romantic... until December, when he got very sick.
 
He was incredibly upset about his illness, and he avoided me completely. He had no job and nothing to do. He openly told me that he was playing videogames and could not talk. He messaged me for maybe half an hour a day. We talked as much as we could regularly, so this was weird to me. I began feeling more distant from him. This lasted two weeks before I went out with one of his friends... twice on one weekend. I kissed this boy, S, and I regret it. I know I made a mistake. I messed up the process of courtship. On top of this, I did not tell Z. He had to find out from his friend. He was upset with me for a month. We ended up dating in late January, after all of this had seemingly blown over. 
It was wonderful for so long. We had our differences, but we always had.

Leading up to the end of our relationship in August, we had been fighting a lot more than usual. I wanted more of him, and it was not working. I, again, went out with a friend while dating him. This time, though, nothing remotely romantic happened. I only realized that Z had been the entire focus of my life. This was the first time I'd seen a friend of mine outside of school in months. I foolishly broke up with him that day instead of trying to make it better. We cut each other off. 

After the breakup, I became a total moron. I drank a lot, I used what I'll call medical heroin, and I was never home. I had drunken sex with someone I'll call D, and we became the slightest infatuated with each other somehow. Z messaged me while I was on a high and told me that his entire life was a blur without me, and asked for me to come back. In a stupor, I told him no. I told him I was happy. We resumed the no-talking phase.
This moronic streak of mine lasted two months. I wasn't happy, I was fucking high. 

This stupid little life of drugs started to fall apart, and when it 
did, I went back to Z. 

He said that I was his second choice, and I only came back because D rejected me. He didn't understand why I rejected him a month ago and wanted him now. This didn't stop him from coming over to my house and sleeping with me three times. He held my hands, he told me he loved me, he cuddled me... it was like old times, and I had hope. But, he kept fighting. He tells me now that he can never see us together again. He tells me every time he plans to go out with another girl, and beats me down for not being happy for him. He told me today that I can learn to be strictly his friend and be happy for him, or be absorbed in my loneliness.

I realize that I threw away the most beautiful thing in my life. I don't want to give it up. I'm willing to wait as long as I have to to get him back to me the way I had him before. I am absolutely lost and broken. I don't want to get over him, but I want feedback on all of this. 

I apologize for my sloppy writing, but I am a bit distraught at the moment. 

Um... any relevant questions will be answered. 

Thank you, from a sad, impulsive and pathetic first time poster on reddit.

This girl moved to my town 9 months ago with her family. She hates this town, but she's liked me since she got here. I was wary at first, just because the small age difference and we seemingly had nothing in common. About a month ago, I decided I was being silly for writing a very nice girl completely off without even giving her a chance. 

We decided to begin dating, and 6 days into it, before our first date, she has a terrible nightmare about her ex, freaks out, and says she's not ready for a relationship. I was confused, but not upset. Two hours later, she calls and says she regrets giving up, and wants us to be together. I tell her to take two to three days and really think about it. She does, and we're back together. She's wonderfully sweet, funny, and I enjoy being around her. We had a great first date, had some lunch dates, and made plans for another evening date coming up this week.

Today she comes to me and says how much she hates this town and wants to move back as soon as she can, and that it's not fair to me to stay in a doomed relationship. I counter with It'll be a year before you're even able to move, so why jump the gun before you know what you want? She breaks down crying, saying that she has no idea what she wants. 

I gave her a speech, basically telling her that she should do what makes her happy and I'll be happy for her regardless. She doesn't believe me, and says she doesn't want us to end. I told her that I'll support whatever she decides and stay friends with her, but she needs to decide if she wants to be in a relationship and if so, to commit to giving it an honest chance.

We split up and jim and me went to a different bar for about 20 mins. When we go there my buddy gave me a heads up that Sarah was the chick who he liked.

I [M 29] have been with my SO [F 29] for about a year now. I'm recently divorced (2011) and she had just separated from her husband a few months before we got together. Our relationship has been unique because of our divorces. We have introduced each other slowly to our respective friends and families because our pasts. However, at this point we are both pretty solidly entwined with each other's lives. I know her friends and she knows mine. We spent Christmas with each other's families, etc. She has never tried to hide me when we are in person. Always refers to me as her boyfriend and acts like it regardless of who is around.

The issue that I'm having is that on Facebook she won't add me as her boyfriend. At first I know that this was to ease the awkwardness for people that she has on her friends list who are friends and family members of her ex husband. I get this. She has a big heart and just because their marriage did not work out it does not mean that they cannot be civil. She does not want to hurt him by flaunting her new relationship. Over time though I feel like this should be less of an issue. She and him are not friends online any more and I really don't see a reason why we can't become facebook official.

Admittedly one of the reasons why I would like to have this status is because she's an incredibly attractive and recently divorced girl. She's shown me her inbox before and gets hit on constantly. I trust her to the moon and back so that's not an issue. I just guess that I would like it to be known that she is actually with somebody.

Anyway, the time came for us to go on our respective years abroad (to different countries, italy and germany). I was distraught when she left to go to germany, I cried every day, multiple times a day, for 2 weeks because i love her so much. When i got to Italy, i was kind of on the verge of depression, and very anxious about the future of our relationship. We talked every day on fb chat, texts and occasionally skyped (her internet connection is worst than comcast, she has to go to cafes/ mcdonalds and use their wifi to get anything more than fb messaging done on the internet). We told each other we loved each other loads. I was still worried but that's just because i love her so much (bad idea, love hurts, but i can't control emotions).

So anyway, after a month of long distance, i went to see her a couple of weeks ago in germany, for a weekend. We had an amazing time, i really enjoyed her company, and the sex was great. She verbally expressed this, and certain other things. This made me feel very happy as i like pleasing her/ making her feel happy, whether in a sexual way or not. So i felt pretty great about that. Also she said some stuff in a jokey way. It wasn't just the sex by any means that made the weekend good, i just really love being around her.

So, when i left back to italy at the end of the weekend i was very sad. crying on the plane, and on the train back to my house. As i said, i love her, and it hurts to leave her.

Anyway, so one of my best friends messages me on fb and asks me how germany was. Some background, he likes sex a lot and he has a girlfriend aswell who i know, and so i said germany was great, and the sex was great. This is where i fucked up bad. I basically told him everything, i'd rather not share details because i've done that once and it came back to bite me, but basically i told him how the sex was, how she reacted, how much she liked it, and things she said. I realise my mistake now, this was said in confidence, and obviously was meant to be an intimate private thing between the two of us. Should have thought about it, but i wasn't really thinking, i was just excited, and my friend is hardly the type of guy i can share my deep emotions with, as that's just not his style. I confide in my family, or one of my other friends, when going through stuff. This conversation however was just pure masculine bravado, and i shouldn't have said any of it. And it was pretty explicit, and for an outsider, it would look like the only thing i cared about that weekend was the sex. really it was the only thing i could talk to that particular guy about. i hardly think he wanted to hear about our romantic stuff.

So this week my gf has come over to visit me in rome, and i leave her my computer for her to do some work on. She goes onto facebook and i'm still logged in (i realised this but thought she wouldn't read the messages). apparently she was concerned about my mental health as i've been acting differently recently (not sure why but whatever) and reads my messages between me and my best friend to see if i've told him anything. She comes across the messages. She then stews for a day, i notice something is off with her behaviour/ attitude towards me but i obviously didn't know she had read the messages so i was pretty worried, but thought it may just be something else. 

The next day she tells me about it and how it made her feel. She said she thought i valued our intimacy, and felt betrayed, and devalued, as if i simply objectified her and saw her as a sex object. I don't really mind she betrayed my privacy considering that's what i did by telling my friend all that stuff. I apologised profusely. I told her i loved her for so many reasons, i don't just see her as a tool for sex, i don't objectify her, and that i feel terrible, and i assured her i would never ever EVER say anything of that sort again. She seemed to forgive me for the rest of the day, and it was fine.

But then yesterday, the way she acted around me changed drastically. I couldn't really get a positive response out of her for anything i said, she didn't find anything funny and she talked to me in a really condescending way if I asked a question. She was pretty mean, and she started snapping at me for stuff and speaking to me like i was stupid. It made me feel pretty terrible. Then, we tried to have sex, and no matter what i did, she wouldn't reach orgasm. I went down on her, nothing. And we couldn't have sex because basically it wouldn't lubricate itself down there. (i don't mean to be explicit but there's no other way of saying it). Anyway, so she got me off, but i just feel like she'd rather not have? I asked her a few times if she was ok, and she said, i asked id something was wrong and she just said no, i've had a bit too much to drink (she's drunk a lot more than that before and still been fine, she'd had like 4 small beers and some wine, but that's not a lot for her). 

I'm basically worried that because she read those mssages (an isolated incident btw) she's changed her opinion of me, and thinks i'm some misogynist, sex obsessed pig who only uses her for sex. I happen to think sex is important in a relationship, and i always make sure she is satisfied. I'm not a selfish lover. That's why i felt bad yesterday, it was unfair that i finished and she didn't. I'm worried she has essentially stopped loving me, she's become cold and distant towards me. I want to save the relationship but i don't how how.

tl;dr: I fucking love my amazing girlfriend, sent explicit messages to my friend about our first long distance reunion and essnetially told him everything, she read them (don't tell me to get angry at her for reading my messages, she read one message thread because she was concerned about me, i'm not angry about it) and now her opinion of me has changed, no longer thinks i'm 'different' to other guys.

They had bought Christmas presents for each other before they started dating. He's either completely in love with her or else just looking at a way of getting back at his ex. Either way it's nothing to do with sex as apparently she has ruled that out for the first few months.

12191,Relationships,32sdp4,"Context: I've been dating my co-worker for 8 months. I'm leaving for the other US coast in one month for med school. We both knew that there was a strong possibility I was leaving, but shit happens. He's older and somewhat reclusive/doesn't drink, so getting him to come out with other people is a small miracle. However, he's very friendly and everyone at work likes him.

He can be insensitive, and I don't deal with it well, but I've gotten super extra batshit lately. Thursday night we had a huge fight. He gets off work at 11pm and I called him (we can use our phones all the time in this job) at 10:30 to see if he wanted to join my friend and I for late dinner right by our work. I was drunk, but my texts weren't confusing. He took forever to reply and when he did, it was like ????? Finally at 11:20, he told me thanks but he was on his way home. I felt very slighted and told him I didn't care basically. I guess this really hurt his feelings because we didn't talk until work the next day. After me being an unstable dick to him all shift, we finally resolved it. A co-worker J (we're faux friends) is dating a mental health client of ours. He said that he'd been listening to her vent while my texts were coming in and that he was deleting them as they came in because us dating is supposed to be a secret. 

We've had a running argument over J... he has admitted that he thinks she's attractive but would never want to date her. She's very flirty, and he hates being touched by people he's not having sex with. He's visibly uncomfortable when she touches him. He always jokes about wanting us to watch have sex with each other. It's immature and annoying.

Things came to a head Saturday when we had another fight. After work, he texted me You keep trying to push me away and I don't know what to do. You win. I was hysterical and made him call me. We talked it out. 

Everything has been wonderful since then until tonight (Wednesday). We've been chatting all night... he even called earlier to tell me about his day, which is adorable because he hates the phone. An hour later he texted that I should come out with him Friday. I asked what he was up to and he said pool. I remembered J mentioning pool the other night

Me: With J?
Him: Yes
Me: Wow
Him: I'm not going without you

I proceeded to make a bunch of sarcastic comments about how I didn't want to hang out with clients and even told him he should go and fuck one like J is doing. It escalated from there because I can't keep my big mouth shut and my anger was fueling more anger. I asked him why he's obsessed with J. I know for a fact nothing is going on or will go on between them. I tried to de-escalate by asking how the conversation of her inviting him went, but he refused to tell me. He accused me of not trusting him. I asked why he ignores my needs and said I can't deal with this. He replied neither can I. I sent 5 more texts and he never replied. He's never not replied to me. Last one was that I was sorry and to tell J that we'd be there.

I am that psycho bitch. The entire time we argued, I just wanted to type Yes, sure, let's do it. Instead I fired off a bunch of angry shit and couldn't stop myself. All I want is a nice last month with him and I can't even seem to make that happen.

I'm trying to figure out why I'm so mad. obviously it has to do with J. It's not that I think he's tempted to sleep with her... I can't put my finger on it. Now that I've typed it out, I feel sillier than ever. I started the fight, and it was totally unneccessary.

I thought all of my previous problems were solved and there's nothing else to worry about. They weren't. 

Pretty soon after we admitted our feelings to each other, things started to get confusing, to say the least. And now, things just seem to be getting worse. It doesn't even seem like she cares about me or my efforts anymore. I feel like I can't do anything to make our relationship better. I've tried everything.


- I asked her a few times if she still liked me after a few months, and she said yes...and left it at that...and I continued to pick up mixed signals.


- I can't talk about our relationship because she's too uncomfortable to. Whenever I try to, she somewhat avoids the question or gives just a yes or no answer. I brought up to her that I felt like I was annoying her, and she just says she's a moody person, and that some days she seems annoyed, others, she's fine.

- I can't spend any alone time with her because she's constantly busy outside of school playing her favorite sport. I've technically only hanged out with her once while we dated. Once in 6 months. Once in the almost 2 years I've known her, actually. I had to be the one to ask her, and we're basically working around her schedule constantly.


- For the past few months, I always visited her during lunch and tried my best to have just a conversation, but she doesn't seem interested at all. She has never even pursued me before, ever. The most she did was tap me on my shoulder to get my attention in the hallway a few times (which is still a pretty rare scenario), but never comes to visit me. I also try my best to compliment her as much as I can, but her reaction has gone from Aww.. to Ha, thanks. or Meh

I probably should also add that when she told me she liked me months ago, she said she gave such short responses because she was nervous about messing something up. But that shouldn't keep her from trying altogether, right? 

She had also told me that she has some social anxiety (despite having a good amount of friends, it seems) and I don't think it would be unreasonable to say that she's also introverted.


TL;DR I'm receiving mixed signals from my shy, introverted girlfriend of six months, to the point of not feeling special anymore. Should I wait until she is more comfortable with me, or just end it? Because this relationship is not making me as happy as it should.

most of the sexual stuff happened in high school where she lost weight and got attention in her not so great social circle (general low lifes, drug users, cheaters etc) and decided to fuck quite a few of them. her history is dating friends, cheating on them with other friends, and fucking her other friends like fwb. 


she thinks its ok to continue to be friends with guys that she has had some sort of romantic relationship with. shes also lied to me about these guys.

12197,Relationships,33y6pf,"I just got a job and am currently looking for more affordable apartments. I've been looking at a range of different living situations. 1 bedroom apartments, 2 bedroom apartments, basement apartments, shared townhomes, etc. Some situations don't have roommates, some do. 

My bf and I have been iffy whether or not we should live together. I told him I'm open to getting a bigger place if he's willing to move in later on, as he doesn't want to move from where he is just yet. So, there is no commitment on his end during this move. I need to move soon and since this is in a college town where people have signed leases months ago, it's a bad time to look. I'm trying to weigh my options.

What I choose will depend on location, privacy, price, what utilities will be added to the price, etc. I'm getting pressure from my dad to move somewhere with a roommate to keep costs low, and I do agree with him. 

As a result, I haven't ruled out homes where there are men. My bf is not happy about this...he says I should do what's best for me but has asked all his friends and family about it before I've even had a chance to look at places that happen to have male roommates and the general consensus is I'm wrong to consider it and one even said to dump me for it. My dad, on the other hand things it's perfectly reasonable, which I was surprised at since he's been so protective of me in the past.

My bf says that while he trusts me, he doesn't trust male roommates and thinks it's guaranteed for them to want to have sex with me. I never said living when boys was my preference but I think it's silly to completely rule out, and I feel that if we disagree about this, we'd probably disagree about other stuff if we lived together. 

We've had a few arguments about this already and I'm already stressed enough as it is about other things going on. I just want to choose what's best for me since he's not involved in the moving and won't commit to something with me. I thought he had better faith in my judge of character...I wouldn't move in with someone I wouldn't feel safe with and I don't want to live one on one with a guy. However, if it's a house with multiple roommates and some happen to be guys that I get along with I don't see the problem. 

He asked how I felt if he lived with girls and I said I don't care as long as he didn't cheat on me...obviously. I trust him not to disrespect our relationship in that situation. It's not like I'd be sharing a bedroom...just a kitchen and living room and bathroom. I enjoy my privacy so I'm not going to choose a place where I don't have my own space. 

I have set up viewings for a bunch of different places with a whole bunch of different scenarios. I don't want to not at least view a place just because someone is a different gender. I'd like to think people were smart enough not to shit where they eat. 

Am I being too inconsiderate?

 I need to make it clear that living with guys is not my most ideal situation, it's just an option. I personally am not comfortable living one on one with a guy, but if it was a house with multiple roommates, and one was a guy, I don't mind.

12199,Relationships,39usyu,"My (26F) boyfriend (28M) and I have been together for 7 years. We've been living together for the past year. For five years before that we were in a long distance relationship (several hours apart by car) as he was in grad school and I finished undergrad and moved on to a different grad school.  We had a really nice, affectionate relationship for the first year or so when we were in college together. Then we had five years of distance-- we saw each other an average of 2 weekends a month, and unsurprisingly I feel like the distance somewhat stunted our growth as a couple. I'm now at a stage in our relationship where I think I should be treated more like a wife (someone he loves deeply and wants to commit to spending his life with), but I feel like I'm being treated more like a friend.
 
I'll give some background, then break this up into 3 categories -- emotional intimacy, physical intimacy, communication (including my understanding of his side of things).



**Background**

This is a post about (what I perceive as) a problem, but I don't want to give the impression that everything's bad in the relationship so I'll say some positive things here: He's a really cool dude, really smart with diverse interests.  When things are good (which is usually, I'm giving that caveat because I'm currently in a bad mood about stuff) we get along better than I ever have with anyone else.  We are liked by each other's families.  We talk and laugh and cook and drink beer and garden together.

**Emotional intimacy**

I don't know how to order these three sections so read them however you want.  I would like a relationship where we talk about our feelings. This was easier to do when we were at a distance, because our feelings were some variation on *I miss you and it would be nicer if we were in the same place*.  Now that we live together I feel like we can have fun together, but I don't really get the sense that he's super *in love* with me.  Like I said above, regardless of whether we're actually married I want to get to feel like his wife-- that is, his partner in life, his soul mate, his teammate.  I feel more like his friend who he enjoys hanging out with.

Small example: I recently saw the acknowledgments page of his dissertation that he finished a year ago. A lot of people (his family, mentors, close grad school friends) get elaborated thank-yous.  My name just comes at the end of a list of other friends.  I know this is a small thing but it feels emblematic to me: he just wasn't really thinking of me or the love and support I'd given him during the five years of long distance while he finished his degree.  (btw I haven't brought this up with him-- I just happened upon it when I was searching my own name in Google Scholar. I feel like I was [accidentally] snooping)

I want to talk about our future together.  For a long time we made a point to avoid talking too much about the future because our first priority was to live together, and so we focused on that.  Now that we do, I've brought up marriage-- I'm ambivalent about weddings, but I like the idea of marriage as a decision/commitment to navigate the ups and downs of life with another person, and I want that in my life. I wanted to make that clear. I was careful to bring it up in a *I don't mean right now* kind of way, but nonetheless he kind of mumbled through a variety of unrelated negative things about marriage/weddings (e.g., family can cause drama surrounding weddings, don't see why you need a certificate for your personal life, high divorce rates, etc) and changed the subject.  He's usually very eloquent.  He also has become more ambivalent about the idea of having kids, when he had previously said he wanted them. 

**Physical Intimacy**

So this has been an issue since we moved in together.  I used to be the limiting factor on how often we were intimate.  About six months before we moved in together I changed birth control (Go Team IUD!) and all the sudden my sex drive was much higher (I mean, it's probably more like a normal sex drive now. I think my BC was suppressing my sex drive before, but I'd been on it since before I became sexually active so who knows).  This was good for both of us at first. However since moving in together, we have sex maybe every couple of weeks.  I would try to initiate every couple of days (I'm going to bed, do you want to come with me? or usually a straightforward Do you want to have sex?) but would usually get declined. He eventually told me that he finds the direct question a turn off.  That frustrated me and for the last few months I haven't really been initiating. We have sex every few weeks now, usually in the shower (which means minimal foreplay and lower likelihood of me getting off).  Before you ask (I promise I'm not this shallow but I have seen people on here dismissed for this reason before): I have not let myself go. I'm a size smaller than I was when we started dating.  He is a size bigger but still in great shape, although I know it bothers him that his body is softer than it used to be. I compliment him frequently.

Something that I think contributes: on a normal work night, we have dinner together and hang out for a bit, then around 8 or 9 he starts playing video games on his computer. I go to bed around 10 and he goes to bed a couple of hours later.  I think that going to bed at the same time would help our intimacy. We've talked about this and he started going to bed with me (even if he then got up and left bed later). It lasted about a week and I think we had sex once.

He is also less affectionate in other ways than I think he used to be. He initiates less casual physical contact. He never really looks at me like he wants to kiss me. When I really feel like I need physical affection or a compliment, I will ask for it. He usually indulges me, but sometimes seems annoyed. Every now and then he'll get in a playful puppy mood where he almost overdoes the affection and I usually end up pushing him away a bit. 


**Communication**

So in answer to your first question: yes, we have talked about this stuff. We have known some couples who have gotten divorced in the last few years.  All of the divorces seem like they could have been avoided if they'd communicated better.  We've talked about that. We've talked about not wanting to go down that road.  So we do talk. Or rather, I talk a lot. Too much.  He responds slowly, after long, silent pauses, with well-formed sentences.  I'm the only one who initiates conversations about Important Things.  I don't know if that's because he doesn't really want to talk about this stuff or because I never give him the chance because I will initiate an Important Conversation at the drop of a hat.

When we talk about it, he says he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. He feels that he demonstrated that by working hard to get a job where I'm going to grad school. He's sorry we don't have sex more often, and thinks that work stress has been affecting his libido.  These conversations often end with an agreement that we'll both work to make things better-- me, to be more patient; him, to be more affectionate.

However, we have these emotional conversations pretty often now, and I feel like nothing's changing.  We're having sex less all the time.  I feel weirder and weirder when I bring up certain topics like weddings (even other people's) or children (we used to bring up baby names that we liked with each other-- the conversations were always playful and just about the names themselves, not about having kids, but when I recently tried to bring up a good name I'd heard the conversation was strangely uncomfortable).

So I'm not really sure what my question is. I think I'd like help with strategies for how to improve things, or how to get him to take a more active role in our relationship intimacy-wise. But I'm happy to hear about anything you observe. Maybe I just need an attitude check.

12202,Relationships,32hq99,"Hey Reddit,


To preface this, there WILL be a TL;DR, and I am trying to be as vague as possible, while giving the whole story, and from my view, the true story. Also, throwaway for privacy.


This is something I’m a bit weird about confessing to, and asking advice about, to strangers on the internet, but here it it.


Three years ago, there was this girl, let’s call her A.


At this point I had known A for a few years, but we weren’t quite….friends. Back then, we didn’t always see eye to eye. She was not single, and dating a friend. I knew her from the friend, and didn’t….entirely approve, but she always seemed to like me, even if I wasn’t the nicest. Three years ago, I ran into her in person. We got along quite well, and continued talking on Facebook as most do, and texting. Before her, life hadn’t been the most kind to me and I was already very wary of dating, and somewhat fearful and uncertain sexually, and not really wanting it all that much. I was on my last straw of giving people chances.


We eventually met up, hung out, dated, held hands, kissed, snuggled, became sexual, and all around had a lovely relationship. We were in love, but back then, we did not truly know love… Three months in to the relationship…rough times happened, for the both of us. This is where I will have to be vague, and I’m sure it’s a story to be told in another way, in another time, when it needs to be said. For now, all that can be said we were forced to break contact, living completely disconnected lives, while going through the greatest struggles in our lives so far. We also completely lost touch, lost numbers, and I had deleted my facebook.


In case you are wondering,we had ZERO choice in the loss of contact. We had some options in the start of things, and it got strained, but we never stopped caring. Then things became out of our hands.


Now a year and a half or so after losing contact, I met someone on the internet, long distance, who I’ll call B. 


To explain more of the mindset I was in, the struggles that happened in those 2 years led me to basically never want to date again, ever. I became severely broken down as a person, lost contact with most people in my life that weren’t direct family, and became very sexually afraid, leaving me not really wanting to be sexual with anyone. 


B quickly became very close to me. It’s….hard to say what we were. I had basically admitted to never wanting to truly be with someone, but she was someone I genuinely enjoyed talking to. We talked most of the day, every day, for nearly a year. We got to know each other very well, which led to trust like I hadn’t had in a long time. This led to a sort of promising ourselves for each other, however, there were issues. On top of being overseas, she also has a fatal illness that leaves her mostly bed-ridden. Things were fairly stable, and the more we talked about actually seeing each other, it seemed to be more of a fantasy than a reality.... As both people that wanted to keep in solitude from everyone except each other, we held on to the hope that it wasn’t entirely impossible. After many months of this, and reality started to become clear, and I knew that I probably wasn’t going to meet her, and if I did, that it would be in a long while. I wanted to make it clear where I stood, how I felt, and what reality was for our situation. I knew that, as far as things had come, even though it would probably hurt her, it had to be done....but then things got worse for her, and I wanted to wait to bring something like that up.


After nearly a year the illness took its toll and went from being stable, but bad, to worsening rapidly. This left the person entirely bed-ridden in the hospital, and we started to talk a lot less, due to their medicine, pain killers, and fear of what this most likely meant in the long term.


During this time, about a month into it, A came back into my life. It was a weird thing, with her having my number, texting me, and things going from there. We met, scared but curious, and after more dates and getting to know each other, fell in love. This led to something I’ve never experienced in a person. A sort of safety, comfort, and feeling of home like I haven’t had before. I have never felt so complete with anyone before her, and being with her, knowing her, talking to her, has all helped me in my healing process from the damage done during the years apart.


However….and this is where I need advice because I am at a complete loss….I have no idea how to tell B. It’s been a few months now, and we still haven’t really had a day to properly talk, let alone long enough for something like this to be brought up. On top of that, since her and I liked our solitude, that means that during this hard time, I am not sure how much news like this would hurt her. I am asking for your help Reddit, on how you think something like this can best be handled. While the long distance thing brought a person I do truly care for into my life, it was something that was never truly real. But I know that it helped give her an anchor and to have hope in a dark time, and I want to help her. I also, due to the rough time, felt certain that I wouldn’t date anyone again, and didn’t want to go out and meet new people, so it seemed that despite not being realistic, it was more probably that I would meet her than be with anyone else.


A, who I am currently with, does know all about this. She understands, and is at a loss along with me as to how to properly handle things. It was actually her idea for this post since she likes the community here and thinks there could be people with more experience in life, or a different perspective, to give insight on how to handle this.


TL;DR: Met and was with happily with A until being forced to cut contact, afterwards during difficult couple of years met B (overseas and bedridden) online and connected in a weird relationship where I was her support, and as that slowly dissipated into almost no contact, A returned to my life, and we are happily in love, but not sure how to tell B without hurting her and inadvertently, worsening her health.

I have been seeing W for about 4 months now. We meet about once a week and we email a lot, every day. It started it wonderfully and in many ways things are still great.

In the beginning there was a lot of imissyou, i wantyou type of romantic emailing. Nowadays I still write such emails, but he completely let this go. I asked him, nagged him (yes, I stopped that completely) but most of the time he has nothing sweet to write or say.

However, our dates are always super fun and sexy. We always end of haveing amazing sex. He is also doinga  bunch of things that are amazing. He bought me a cake for my birthday. Then a day later he invited me to a market and beforehand he said he'd like to buy me a lavender pillow that I can warm in a microwave and it would keep me warm in my cold apartment. A couple weeks ago he came to fix my car in heavy rain. He gave me his jacket when I was cold.

So he is completely lovely and adorable, but when I ask him anything about us he freezes and nowadays he also won't return any kind words. I don't understand this bit at all! I did throw tantrums about it and emailing less than before. It didn't help. But many times I thought, that's it, now he's going to break up or just never email or meet me again because of my demands. No, he always remained chilled and I praised him for being so tantrum resistant. He then said he does notice the tone.  

Yes, I know tantrums aren't ok. I did stop. He is a very nice guy and has lots of friends. He is sick and I offered him chicken soup and TLC, but he sort of brushed me off. He also said he gives a hand with car repairs to many friends. 

Anyways, I'm so confused. I love him a lot. I certainly don't want to make life hard for him. He is truly awesome, but I'm not sure where we are going. 

I am not throwing tantrums anymore. But I'm lacking something here. He doesn't want to/like to talk about these things, so I am waiting....

Please offer me your insight. I'm the type who is in love in the beginning and exes in my life really appreciated the warmth and energy in me.

Last night I came home around 11:20pm and found a bottle of KY on the footstool and a vibrator on the floor. She was past put on the couch. I figured she gets horny when she is high so she was probably just blowing off steam. Decided to look through her phone and went to the Web browser and saw youporn open and brushed it off....... Then I went to the texts. I see our conversation, then a text to a contact listed as A. The text said I wanna fuck you ;). 

I'm Android, she's iPhone. It took a minute then I realized she sent it. I immediately told her to get up and explain who it was. It was a guy going by the name of Erick (M30) and then met on chat roulette a week ago so she says. They started talking and added one another on Facebook. I asked her if he had ever seen her naked. She went quite then said no. I called her bullshit and she said she sent him a chest pic. 

I don't know all the conversations they have had and honestly I'm scared to. I want to try and fix this but I'm just not sure I can ever trust her again. Any advice would be nice.

12207,Breakups,2aqxk8,"I filed for divorce on July 1st, after putting up with her verbal and emotional abuse for 2 years. She immediately left the house with my son, and says that she wants full custody. Up until the 10th, I knew where she was staying. On the 11th she had to leave her friends place (she was house-sitting) and go somewhere else. When I asked where she was going to stay, she refused to tell me. I asked her about 10-15 times over the past 3 days, and each time she ignored me or said it was none of my business. I went to my Company Commander about it (I am in the Army) and he said he would pull her on-post privileges if she refused to tell me. I relayed this info to her, and she finally gave in and told me where she was living. Aaaand she said that I wasn't invited to come over. No biggy. As long as I know where my son is. 
When I called her this morning to try to get her to sit down and talk about what she wanted in the divorce, she informed me that she had a surgery today, and she needed time to heal up before she wanted to talk about things. Oh, and I needed to watch my son tonight. Of course, I was totally cool, and a bit overjoyed, to spend time with my son, but why the hell didn't she tell me about this surgery sooner?? I knew she wanted to get the surgery (basically a plastic surgery, nothing major), but I had no idea it was this week. I just saw her the night before, and she never mentioned it.

So my son is back in my house tonight. And I plan on keeping him here. When she comes back tomorrow to try to get him, I'll tell her no.

12208,Breakups,1zi916,"It has been a little over 2 months since my ex GF broke up with me. We almost never fought during our relationship and didn't have a big blowout at the end. Our problem was that we moved way to fast and nearly spent all our free time together. The first 4 and a half months were incredible and we became deeply infatuated with one another. It seemed like everything was going great and then out of the blue she told me she just became a little burnt out. She discussed with me how we could make things better, but then 2 days later she ended it and crushed my heart.

Now 2 months have passed and I've started casually seeing another girl, but still can't get my ex off my mind. Which isn't fair for anybody. This new girl is super sweet and I really do like her a lot, but I can't help but think about my ex sometimes.

I also have reason to believe my ex may have started seeing another guy but I'm unaware of the severity of the relationship.

So I guess my question is, should I try contacting my ex to see if she has any feelings for me still, or just leave it be?
She meant so much to me and became one of my best friends and I hate having her out of my life completely.

I know I said that I started seeing someone, and I do like her, but we both will graduate in June. I don't know if I should put too much of my heart and effort into a new relationship? I think we both realize that this may just be short term anyways.

I met her through my best friend (they are family). She was pretty and blew my mind away. I really felt that I wouldn't have a chance so I just was very calm about everything. I presented her to my friends and we would hang out. I began getting to know her and it turns out she just got out of a long and painful relationship, just like me so we would talk about it here and there. As time went we became close friends and she told me that she has never been on a date in her life, because her ex never did anything like that ( this guy was an asshole, he would rob money and do crazy shit so yeah...believable).


Time went by and I invited her to her first date ever, I tried my best to make it as thoughtful as ever and to the most nicest place around. When we went back to a friend’s house she got separated from me and began flirting with my friend(dude1). Turns out she liked him. I felt like shit. I couldn't be friends with her because I was begging to hurt me, so I decided to stop talking with her. 


A year goes by and I am with my best friend on thanksgiving. I see her and casually said hi. We chatted for a while and it turns out nothing really happened with dude1, she was interested but he was just a manwhore. She was still single and hasn’t gone out or had anything in the past year. In a way I felt like we could just be friends so we began texting again. I was away from the country but we would talk as much as possible and I developed feelings again, I felt a chance.

this friend managed his way to become dude2.


Yep, he got her number and they began talking. I was ok with it, I am not jealous or anything but still it would be annoying. Then it would be consistent and I just had to ask her. She told me that I was her friend and I really don't fit in her way of life. 


I felt like shit....again. But now it's worse because she would look in to my eyes and ask me not to disappear again. She confessed that it really hurt her the first time I left, because I was her closest friend. She also told me that she also had feelings for me the day we hung out after my trip but then it just was a quick thing.

However, I went off medication for manic depression (bipolar) for 2 years and...let's just say I had some serious bumps in the road. Never went to the psych ward but I resisted going back on medication.


IMPORTANT: I had 3 serious episodes which interrupted my life over the course of 2 years...I finally went on medication recently and am doing much better...but the first time I had an issue, which was last fall, it happened to be her birthday and she gave me so much fucking shit about it. I still feel like my mental and physical health (bipolar people have been known to be suicidally depressed) was way more fucking important than making her feel special on her fucking birthday.


I was like, I needed time to ride it out. It took me 10 days to feel better. I love you, I wanted to do something special for you, but I needed to be safe, stay out of public, and talk to my doctor. I didn't decide to go on medication until a few months ago...after she dumped me. 

Basically, each of the 3 times I was in trouble, it would last 2 to 3 weeks. I would become manic and then severely depressed, physically debilitated. I would have delusions. Every single time this happened I would ask her to stay away from me because well...she made me feel worse during these times. So after that first time, I asked her to give me space when I felt terrible during a post-mania depression. It made my recovery more secure. I had to protect myself. 

Finally, after the last one, she dumped me, and I think it's because she felt abandoned by me whenever I asked for space. She has severe abandonment issues with her father (left family when she was 11, never paid child support, was abusive to her mother).


Now I loved this girl more than anything...asked her to marry me (1.5 years ago) and she said she wanted to but needed to see where we were at a little later on. I wanted to be with her forever.


I feel so sad and crushed that she dumped me largely for my bipolar which, before I went back on the meds, was pretty much out of my control. I just made sure I exercised and slept enough and mostly I was fine. Until I wasn't...

12215,Dating,2xao63,"I've got this wonderful woman in my life. We met our first year of college and have been best friend ever since. Along the way it has been complicated with various things. Right after first meeting we tried dating, we decided it wasn't working for either of us and broke up but remained friends. Over the past 18mo we've become best friends. She went through 2 short relationships with the same guy and broke up twice, this most recent vowing not to go back. I've been her go-to person ever since we broke up. We talk about everything and anything, we have similar interests and enjoy each other's company.

When she broke up with her boyfriend the 2nd and most recent time she had some emotional difficulties that she came to me with. Over the course of a month or so she realized how much I care for her, and has started reciprocating and caring more for me. I've always been looking out for her best interest in everything, I'm not sure why. It's the position I've grown into. Recently we had a few conversations about our relationship and what we want out of it. The conclusion was inconclusive.

We've always been close, and we do lots together. Recently we started non-sexually sleeping together occasionally. That progressed to being more physically intimate in private and then having sex a few times. Now she is comfortable holding my hand in public and kissing me when we part ways.

We have awesome communication and can discuss our relationship openly, but we cant decide what we're doing right now. She mostly refuses to call me her boyfriend, and I don't really want to call her my girlfriend(we mostly joke about it),  but from the relationships around me I know we're closer and more communicative than most. She just wants to wait and see what happens, and while I don't mind that I want to know how seriously to take this.

There has been something she does that bothers me though. She and I will discuss things that are bothering her. I opened up to her about my insecurities about leaving home just yet. I've been dealing with alot of stuff (mainly future focus issues) so naturally, I open up to her about it all. After talking with her about all of those issues and some plans I had for the future (wanting to pay equally for a home with her), I found out that she's told a few friends what we discussed. 

I'm cool with her talking to friends about me but  the way I found out was not very good. Basically, she told me katy's boyfriend bob thought it was odd that you wanted to pay equally for a house or ashley thought this whole thing with your parents was weird and that you need to move out pronto. I'm just left sitting there thinking why do these people whom I've never met know any of this. It's nothing major like our sex life (I hope) but I felt embarrassed and under the microscope. No matter how rocky things with us have gotten, I've kept our discussions between us and only left a positive image of her on everyone in my life. 

Me being the big wuss I am, just glazed over it instead of confronting her and now I feel like it's too late to bring it up. Am I being too sensitive? Maybe I'm overreacting to this.

12217,Dating,2oi38r,"I know this girl A a bit longer than a year now, when she joined our student club. We never really talked much because we never really got to it, we both have our own friends. She's a very beautiful girl.

Same thing with male friend B, also member since 1 year. He's become a good friend over the course of a year, very cool guy. Although there's one thing I don't get about him: what's going on between him and A. From what I understand it went a bit like this (what A, B and other people told me. He doesn't like to talk about it). He asked her as a date for his prom 2,5 years ago, went on a couple dates but nothing ever happened and they became friends. However, few months ago they both kissed while they were piss-drunk, and he has been acting differently since: talks about her a lot more, doesn't want to be seen smoking cigarettes when she's near, other things but won't admit he's got a crush on her. Everyone I know however thinks he has.

A doesn't think B has feelings for her.

2 weeks ago me and this girl were drunk, dancing and we wanted to start kissing. We went home together, mostly to not confront our friend with the fact that we were kissing. Of course it didn't stay with kissing, although we didn't have sex we did masturbate each other. Now, the morning after we're sober again so we get to talking, I actually like this girl... She asks me to keep what we did a secret from people we know because she doesn't want B to be hurt. And that's it, I'm off.

Ok, no problem, had one night stands before, this shouldn't be too hard. Over the course of 2 weeks I see A and B a few times, all is normal. But a couple days ago i cracked: I invited her over for a movie at my place.

We watch the movie and get to talking again, very pleasant conversation till early in the morning. She ends up spending the night and sure, same things happened as last time. This is 5 days ago, now we're still texting each other couple times a day.

I guess I'm starting to get feelings for A. I think she just wants something physical as people think of me as kind of promiscuous, and she seems to think the same. This is actually not true, only had a couple of sexual partners but for some reason people seem to think this about me.

Now here's what I've been wondering the last days.

I've been feeling like kind of an asshole to B, and think I might have screwed up our friendship.
Should I tell him what happened? And if so, how should i go about this? Don't want to argue with him over this, or lose him as a friend.

Should/can I proceed things with A, and if so how? I like her a lot, she's awesome to be with. But I really don't know if she's interested. And she's eager to keep everything a secret from B.

It's sucked a lot, and what's making it worse is that my gf hasn't really talked to me since, which is so weird.

It will be hard to read since I'm not a native speaker.

Yesterday my girlfriend left me and this morning she told me she had made the right decision. We had been together for three years and it was, for both of us, our best relationship and we had serious plan about the future. We talked about living together and everything.

Problems started in April, I talked three weeks with a girl on Facebook, I knew her from mutual friends but we saw each other only twice. I told my GF of it, but it was very casual at that time.

After a couple of weeks of chatting we really started realizing we really felt good talking each other. We did say a couple of things like 'I miss talking to you' because I meant it. It was really refreshing talking to her BUT it never got past that. We talked about *maybe* seeing each other but only for talking, we specified that it wasn't a date or anything. In the end we never did, because she felt bad knowing I had a GF and me, well, I was scared really. Of what could've happened with my loved one.

I hid my GF this sort of chatting had developed and it was more intimate (?) and she eventually find out. We had our discussion but finally we went over it and continued with our story and I decided not to talk with that girl anymore, because I would not lose my GF because of her.

We had an amazing summer until last week, we had fun, we really were so good together, I felt great because I have some sort of anxiety problem but I got good grades at my University so I really felt like my life had a turn from past sadness.

The other girl sometimes wrote me, brief messages because she want to sort of catch me up with her life and I answered her, once. Because I still felt some sympathy for her. I never felt something more, not love, not lust. I hid that from my GF, *again*.

She had a hint, can't remember how and I finally told her that she was still writing me and I even answered her once. She went mad because she told me already once I had to be open with her and tell her everything of it, instead I hid it, because I was scared. 

She left me, because of this, because she can't trust me anymore. I know she's right, I know I can't be trusted. I know I messed up and shouldn't have done what I have done. If only I could go back in time, I was so stupid. 
I'm feeling like I had the most precious and beautiful thing in the world right in my hands and I slammed it down apart. Now I can only look at what I have done.


She still feels everything for me, she told me she still love me, because feelings don't change in a day. She wants to get back with me but she can't. I think she's right, she can't but maybe - *maybe* - if I change she will gift me with a second (really, third) opportunity to demostrate her that I'm not that kind of guy anymore.

I know I messed up, I should've blocked her from anything. Should have not answered anywhere and should've told my GF everything. But I got this too late, I can't fix it anymore, I can only change I think. I want my loved one back, if possible. She was everything to me. 

Thanks for reading it through. It might be stupid but I wanted it wrote down and maybe you could give me a couple of advices. Maybe I just have to accept it. I already told her before she left me that I would've done everything humanly possible to build something big next to this little thing. She wanted to stay with me, grow older with me.

We've had cyclical bickering problems. It really takes a toll on her. We've discussed it a few times before and state each time that we would work on speaking better to each other. We have what appears to be terrible communication skills. 


During our conversations about ending it this week, I realized that we've both had terrible role models all our lives and that we need to re-educate ourselves on how to speak in a healthy manner. She agrees that this is true. To me, saying that we'll work on speaking better is a good start, but we don't realistically have any resources to do so. I feel like our communication skills are acquired throughout life, and not easily changeable on your own.


I really want to keep working on it with her, but she keeps saying she doesn't have any try left. However, she still loves me. She came over today to say goodbye. I asked her over and over to go to counseling with me, to at least see if there's anything we can salvage. She refused several times and then ultimately agreed. I'm not sure if she agreed to it for me, or because deep down there's some try left in her. I said if we go to a session, and she doesn't feel it will do anything, I will walk away.


I feel like an asshole. I really think our problems are fixable. She told me that everything else in our relationship is fine, and if we didn't have communication problems, then we would be great.

I (F/26) have been with boyfriend (M/24) for 2 years. We get along pretty well. Biggest problem is I can't seem to disagree with him.

If I bring up a counterpoint, he takes it personally and thinks I am purposefully trying to make him feel stupid. If I try to bring up a different perspective, I am being argumentative. He says I am trying to pick fights for the sake of picking fights.

I acknowledge that I do like a good debate, and I like trying to consider all sides of a story. He can be very tunnel vision sometimes, and can be very critical of people as a whole, but I understand sometimes people just want to vent. So I stopped disagreeing so much. Even if I disagree with his points I will just nod understandingly and give noncommittal answers.

But it sometimes seems ridiculous. Take this morning for example (not verbatim):

Me: Blah blah. This gym has a real good deal, but the locations aren't really good.

Him: There is a location by my old house that is sorta by your work.

Me: That is still pretty faraway. It would take me really out of the way during my commute home.

Him: It was just a suggestion. You don't have to put me down like that.

Okay. What? I asked him what he meant and he said that I don't have to turn it down so harshly as it makes him feel like an idiot. I asked him how can I phrase things so he won't take things so personally and he basically gave an example of That's a good suggestion but I think that is out of the way too much. And that is a nicer way to say the same thing, I agree. Though I think it sounds a bit patronizing, and do I really need to compliment him every time I disagree? I told him this is getting frustrating because it seems like I am not allowed to disagree with him at all. He saw I was getting annoyed, so he backed up quickly and changed the subject and basically ran away from the problem which is what he tends to do.

I try to keep things light hearted and have things roll off my back, and generally I am more forgiving than passionate... but every couple of months, it just gets real annoying to not speak my mind and feel like I have to always make sure I am not stepping on his pride, I guess.

I honestly don't know if the problem is me or him though. I might phrase things more abruptly and harshly then I intend, and I do have a very take charge, no-nonsense persona sometimes that can probably come off as bitchy. I also know he is very critical of people as a whole and he can be prideful and sometimes insecure, so I know that plays into things as well.

What is the best way to disagree with someone where they don't take it personally?

P.S.: I know this paints him in a bad light, but he really isn't a bad person. This is one facet of a very nice, fun, loving and intelligent man. We all have our faults, and I acknowledge mine and his. I am trying to figure out if there is a compromise where I can still disagree without coming off as bitchy or confrontational.

Now, my father died when I was six, I don't really remember my dad that well, sadly..  But my uncle Alex stayed around and helped my mom out, and he remained in my life and we're really close.

Tonight, a very turbulent relationship with someone who was a close friend of mine for years ended. We dated shortly when we were 17 and have harboured feelings of love for each other ever since. The last 8 months were over long-distance, and we were engaged. We have the most amazing connection, one where I feel like being with him is home. Tonight, that was taken away.

I have had issues in the past with hating myself and therefore criticizing him a lot. I've gotten better in the past month, doubled up the therapy, upped my medication. However, we got to a point last week where he began to distance myself. He had internalized my criticisms to the point of not being able to be with me because he was a fuck-up, because he attributes my horrible past year to himself, because he feels like he can't be what I want to be.

I gave it every thing I could and in the end it was just “I can’t. I’m a fuck up. I am not ready to be the person you want me to be.”
No matter how much I convinced him the person who I wanted was him, he left. He told me he couldn't and he had to go, and he shut me out. He was sure he would disappoint me, would make me sad and put it all on him. He told me he was a failure, he had failed at making me happy, and that was it.

The long distance ended this month, we were moving in together. Things were going to be different and I told him that.

So I drove away with a broken heart, wishing with all I had that I could have convinced him that he was what I wanted.

12224,Relationships,1o63rc,"My current girlfriend and I have been together for a year, and recently (the past 1 or 2 months), I've been beginning to have anxious thoughts about our relationship. I guess I'll start with a little background:

My girlfriend [20], who I'll call M, and I [21] work together and we also go to the same school. We don't live together however. We rarely fight, which I'm still not sure is a good thing or bad thing.

M has really been the most significant relationship I've ever had, romantic or personal. I've never been this close to someone before, and that includes friends and family. I still hide things from best friends I've had for almost a decade, but I don't have to hide anything with her. She has also really been the only girl I've truly been intimate with. I had one relationship in high school, but I would hardly call it that.

Over the past year that we've been together, M has made me such a better person. I've never been more happy or confident in my life. But something she said a few months ago got lodged in the back of my mind and has now come loose to drive me crazy. She told me that she was afraid to lose me because, since I haven't really been with anyone else other than her (I don't count my high school relationship), that I might want to leave her for someone else. At the time I told her she was crazy and that I would never do that to her.

I scared now because I'm starting to think she was right. I don't think I would ever be able to leave her. I love her too much; just the thought, the fantasy, the day dream, of leaving her kills me and makes me feel guilty. But I can't help but imagine being with another girl and what I'm missing out on. If we were older, maybe this wouldn't be such a big deal. But we're still really young. Not to mention the added pressure of recent talks about maybe finding a place to live together and the possibility of having a family one day. She told me that she wanted to have a family with me one day, when we're ready of course. And I feel the same way. 

I know this is a really crude analogy, but its the best one I can think of: I feel like I've won the game. Except I won the game on, more or less, my first try, and rather easily too. And I want to play again. But like Pokemon, I can only have one save file at a time. I can't start a new one without destroying the previous. 

I love M so much and I really want to be with her, but at the same time I want to try something different, especially since I'm still young and inexperienced. But obviously, the two are mutually exclusive, unless you want to live with possibilities of the unfortunate consequences. The cognitive dissonance of wanting to have my cake and wanting to eat it too is causing me to have existential crisis' on a weekly basis. Especially since, recently, a co-worker has started flirting, harmlessly of course, with me and I know if I wasn't in a relationship, I would totally go after her.

Thanks for reading this. I just needed to vent without having to pay a shrink. Any advice is appreciated. I feel like I'm being super selfish thinking these thoughts and having these anxieties. If you think I am being selfish, please tell me. I maybe be able to come to terms with this easier if what I'm feeling is selfish. That's something I may be able to work on.

Contract got renewed and her longterm girlfriends tell her hey we should go in vacations together, let's go to India!... 

I was really annoyed, it felt like a slap in the face. I told her... well we were supposed to go after the summer and suddenly you can and you give your girlfriend priority...

We had a bit of an argument about it... I told her I felt excluded. From my point of view I would never accept an invitation from friends without offering her to join.

So I tried to explain I just need a bit of reassuring. You should make sure to ask what is their intension for this trip. because if you are going to play third wheel while your friends just want to hook up with guys then that's not really cool. 

I told her I just need a bit of reassuring... for example if there is a group of guys that start following you girls around then you should tell them that it is not what you had planned for and ask me to join.

She goes: yeah i will tell them that but you should trust me I will never do anything to hurt you.

If I told you to go on vacation with one of my female friends, how would you feel? she replied I will be really jealous... I told her then -but if I go with my single male friends you trust me? -yes... 

I explained that I would never go on a holiday with my single male friends without inviting her. They will definitely be hanging out with girls... and if the girls spend most of the vacations with us... then it is the exact same thing as going on a holiday with my female friends without inviting her.

I feel really bad about because my mind tells me I can trust her 100% but my guts says this is bad... I have past issues. My ex girlfriend behaved completely differently when she was with her friends and went on a holiday and 4 days later it was over... So I am terrorised that the situation will happen again.

My girlfriend feel insulted that I don't know better, that I don't trust her... I feel I trust her but I don't trust her friends, and I don't trust that my girlfriend will be able to say no to them if she gets pushed around.

Please note that I don't mind when she goes on girls' night out or hang out with some of her male friends. I don't think I am completely insecure... I think it is a mixed bag of feeling.

She thinks that intention is the most important and I believe that being above suspicious is really important in everything we do. (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeia_(wife_of_Julius_Caesar) )

I sent her this message today saying that I am too capricious, that she is formidable... that I am sorry and that I love her. I have all these traumas, I need to deal with by myself. I understand she needs to do things on her own and feel independent. 

I remember this cheesy line from Indecent Proposal: If you want something very badly... set it free. If it comes back to you, it's yours forever.”

I went to see a therapist today and I'll be seeing the same therapist again tomorrow to do some kind of regression and see where all this extreme anxiety is coming from.

I can't think straight, my stomach hurts, I can't focus on my code. I took a valium last night and another one this morning... I feel awful.

Anyway over the year things kind of degraded in the sense that contact kind of broke down as we had much less opportunity to speak to or see each other. If I'm honest a lot of it was to do with me as I didn't really make much effort but at the same time neither did she, albeit she probably made more than me.

So she came home for the summer and everything was alright I suppose, but then just before she left to go back to where she studies she broke up with me citing how we aren't as close, don't know what's happening in each other's life etc.

I didn't argue when she did it as I had also had my doubts and honestly thought I'd be better off without her, but then as days went past I started to wish I'd spoke up and tried to sort things out. I went to visit her a few times while she was still here to hopefully convince her and we kind of acted like a couple, plus we still talked etc. over facebook/text and she said she still loves me but she needs time to think (a few weeks she said).

So now she's went back to where she studies and it's like I don't exist anymore, she's stopped replying to my texts, messages etc. I get that she has a lot going on but I knew she was deliberately ignoring me as my FB messages went unread/unreplied to despite the fact she was posting at the same time. The messages were only little things like How has your day been?, How was your night etc. I wasn't trying to plead or anything.

So then she says I'm not giving her the space she needs right now, but my biggest fear is that if I stop talking to her she'll assume I've given up and that that's the way it'd be if we got back together. I want to prove to her that if we got back together things will be different in that I will make much more effort. I don't really know what to do as you may have guessed.

I am very grateful for any advice you can give me, but not to sound dismissive or anything I don't really want to hear You're young, forget about her and move on with your life.

There are hundreds of posts with people who can't get over their ex's but they seem less relevant to my situation.

---

A little over 5 years ago my partner and I (we'll call her Kirsty) parted ways after what was looking to become quite a long and complicated separation. It was obviously a tough time, not least of all because we had 2 beautiful daughters whom we wanted to protect from the whole thing as much as possible. At that point we had been together for almost 10 years.

**To be clear, I did not want to break up with Kirsty and would have done anything to avoid it. Unfortunately she felt that she didn't love me anymore and she wanted out. Which was fair enough I guess**

I moved into an apartment nearby. Close to Kirsty and the kids and close to their schools and my work etc. Ever since then I have had the kids twice a week, sometimes more, with them typically spending Tuesday nights and the weekends with me. I am really thankful that I have been so lucky to still have so much time with the children and to be on (to a certain extent) such good terms with Kirsty. I know this is not the case for many guys and I am truly thankful for this.

Because I am so close by (whether at home or at work) I also even see them in between these times and will regularly get calls either from the kids or from Kirsty when they need some odd job doing or if there's any one of a million little things that can come up when you're parents (kids become ill, need something urgently from the store, need a ride somewhere, need help with homework etc etc).

**The bottom line here is that i see them practically ALL THE TIME** which is great for my relationship with my kids (thank god) but has unfortunately meant that I don't seem to have ever really gotten over Kirsty.

---

To help you understand, let me list some of the things I'm up against here;

* She's gorgeous, funny and sexy and I guess, as stupid as it sounds I still love her.

* She jokes and flirts with me all the time. It's just her nature to do so, i don't think it means anything.

* When collecting the kids or i'm over there, if she's not wearing pajamas (vest and panties) or very little in that respect, then she is dressed up in a revealing summer dress or some other outfit that is very difficult to ignore.

* Some times she still tells me private stuff and confides in me, as a close friend i guess. I mean we were together for all those years.


**Anyway, the thing is that by this point** after 5 years, i dread going over there in some ways, and when I am there now I can't help but look at her with an aching heart and think about everything I've lost. As a result, and because of all the confusing feelings this causes for me, sometimes when she's joking and flirting with me I can be quite cold and short with her. Even harsh at times. It's all just a bit much for me to take these days.

Over the last 5 years she has had multiple boyfriends that I have known of, most have never been introduced to the children (but I have obviously known), although one guy was serious enough that he was introduced to them and was almost a permanent fixture for a while (that didn't last though). In addition I know that she has had a lot of casual sex and one night stands during this time (we know a lot of the same people and this is a small town, people seem to love telling me this shit). **To be clear I'm not judging her here I'm just trying to help you understand my state of mind.**

In contrast... in the last 5 years I haven't met anyone that I have really wanted to be with. Recently (in the last year) I have forced myself to try harder to put myself out there (as my best friend would say) and I did have a few brief dates with 2 women. In both cases I broke it off after a couple of dates or when they wanted to get sexual. I just couldn't face it, they weren't Kirsty and when I was with them all I could think of was how they weren't her and all the ways in which they didn't measure up. It just wasn't fair on them really.

---

I'm not gonna lie, I have had some pretty low times. Especially when I have known that she is with someone else and I am so blatantly lost and alone. Because of the childcare arrangements it often occurs that I am collecting the kids when she is already dressed to the nines to go out on a date. Once (and I know this was fucking stupid, and I shouldn't have done it) I even ended up giving her a ride somewhere when she was going on a date... How ridiculous is that... Me, her lovesick ex dropping her off to see some guy, all dressed up for a date. Soul destroying.

I know that if we weren't tied to each other by the kids I would have walked away and done my best to never see her again, probably even moved across the country and started again. It would have been the only way to move on and get over her. But that just wasn't an option...  I used to think I just needed more time, but after 5 years, and these recent failed attempts with other women... as the months and years keep passing I am starting to wonder... **HOW AM I EVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OVER HER?**

To be clear, I know we will never get back together and she just doesn't love me. I know the whole thing is futile. I just can't control the way that I feel towards her.

I really hope some people have had similar problems or at the very least felt the same way  at some point and can give me some advice on what they did and how they got over this. I've got my fingers crossed for any kind of insight or advice.

Sorry it was such a long post guys, but I could have gone on so much more. If you did manage to battle through the whole thing, Thankssssssssssss.

**tl;dr**: After a 9 year relationship (with 2 kids) she ended it. Now 5 years later, she has completely moved on and I just can't seem to stop thinking of her in that way. I see her all the time because of the kids and I keep it all to myself but it's ruining my life. How do I move on?

12229,Infidelity,28qs8m,"I(F22) found out a week ago that my so (M23)  of about 2 years has been cheating on me for at least a year. I care about him so much and in him I really felt like I had found my soul mate, my partner for life, my other half. We were engages but I gave him back his moms ring because it felt wrong to have it on. We are trying to work things out though.  How do I go back to trusting him and loving him blindly like I did? How can I touch him and not be overwhelmed with thoughts of what he's been doing and with disgust and insecurity in regards to myself? How so I hlget my confidence back and my self-assurance in our relationship? I just feel so damn pathetic and disgusting and repulsive now. How do I go back to trusting him? 
 I hate the jealous, paranoid and irrational person I've become in the past week since I found out. How do I change that? How do I tap back into the connection we had? Why am I stopping myself from having it again and how do I change that? 
Sorry for the rant, I'm just so confused and I feel really weird. 

Any advice helps... Only serious replies please, I don't want to hear about how I should leave him. He's an incredibly loving and compassionate person. The only reason he did those things is because I wasn't being as present and supportive as I could have been. Maybe I'm just too fucked up to be with him, or anyone really. But if hell give me a second chance, I sure as hell don't want to blow it again. Thanks for listening guys (or reading)

And yes, I know that 2 years together is really short to be engaged. For the record, he asked me and it was more of a promise that wed get married farther down the he line when were more stable financially and such.

 I've only had one longterm bf and dated a couple before him. I'm not the person to actively seek a relationship when I'm single because I never really felt that it was necessary.  Usually happy to just go with the flow and I'm usually quite comfortable with myself, as a single person as much as a gf. It really only was once I started to develop really deep feelings for him and an incredible connection that didn't even require us to speak to communicate that I can now state that I really honestly feel that he is my soul mate and that when I'm with him its like I've found a part of myself that I never knew was missing and this really is the person I want to spend my life with and and grow old with and have children with. 

and even after all his I still feel that way, I am just also overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy and insecurity and jealousy and mistrust. Generally speaking, I get along well with almost anyone bit I'm also quite the introvert and I'm so happy to just have a small tight group of people that I love and trust and who feel the same way about me. I've struggled with abandonment issues since my father died when I was  8and my mom became an abusive depressive drunk. Then my sister went crazy and I was left to fend for myself from quite a young age. So this really hit hard. I've had people cheat on me in the past, but it didn't feel anything like this does, because I've never felt this way about someone before.

I genuinely want this to work, and I really need some advice about how to let go o of all of this and move on and be better. Please.

12231,Relationships,2clyyu,"So I've been dating this girl for 6 months, with 3 of it long distance as she went home for the summer (we go to the same university). Everything has been going great, a couple minor jealousy issues but nothing major. We are happy together and try to visit at least once a month to combat the distance until school starts again. 

But last night she decided to go to a rave with some girlfriends. When she asked me and told me she'd probably be taking mdma (molly, ecstasy etc.), i expressed that I felt a little uncomfortable with it. She's never done mdma before while I have some experience with it, and I know how horny it can make you and how it can lower your inhibitions. I didn't feel right letting her go to this rave while in that state, without me there, surrounded by sweaty dudes who are undoubtedly under the influence as well. 

But she had already paid for her ticket and I didn't want to seem super controlling, so she went. Now, one of my conditions was that she just had to let me know what was going on and how she was doing on a regular basis throughout the night. Well, by 11pm she is wasted. Can't form a sentence, just getting one word jibberish. I was starting to get pretty anxious, just over pure worry for her. I repeatedly asked her if she was ok, all I get is fab and then silence for about an hour. 

Apparently during this gap she took the mdma, and suddenly comes back with full sentences about how  she doesn't want me to be mad and how this isn't her scene while randomly giving me incoherent little love texts. I chalked this up to the drug, but it makes me wonder how loving she was to the people around her too. I just try my best to make sure she's ok before I finally fell asleep at 3am, with her still going hard. 

By morning she had had her phone stolen, and apparently didn't get home until 7am. We started talking over FB messages and she insisted that she was ok and that nothing happened apart from a few guys trying to dance with her. She was very defensive and passive when I brought up the subject of guys however, something felt off in my gut. She says she can see why I'm uncomfortable and that none of this was worth it, but it bugs me that she hasn't actually said sorry to me once and doesn't seem very concerned about my feelings at all as long as I'm not mad at her

Am i overreacting? How should I proceed in letting her know that what she did isn't fully ok in my books?

Katie (alias) and I have been together for nearly 3 years, and we were best friends for 3 years of college before that. She graduated a while before me and got a great job nearby. We started dating around then, and after not long I moved in with her. Things were going well.

1 year ago, she started complaining about her job. Every. Single. Day. She became anxious, snippy, and depressed. It was very tough to be around her. At this time I was just about to graduate and head into the job market, and her constant negativity did not have me looking forward to it.

This January, just after graduation, I was absolutely frantic in my job search. A friend hooked me up with a short-term job that I knew wouldn't cut it, so I worked my 20 hours a week and spent close to 40 hours a week searching for jobs, researching businesses, crafting resumes and cover letters, and handling follow-ups. In March I got another job that was just as hopeless, so my search continued. I was becoming dismayed and exhausted, and she was still a constant source of negativity. I started pushing her to go see a psychologist or therapist or anyone, really, because it was clear to me that she wasn't going to get out of this slump and she was dragging me down with her.

In May, I got a fantastic job that I'm still with today. Finally, my work payed off! I was able to relax and enjoy life a little, but I didn't get to do that because she was *still* depressed, etc. I was still pushing her to see a doctor, but to no avail.

In July, she was informed that she was let go and would be leaving in 3 months. She is a scientist, and the funding ran out to continue her project, so she got to work until the budget ran out. She became even more anxious and depressed after this. I pushed harder than ever to get her to see someone, especially now that her insurance is going to run out. That logic got to her, and she did see someone who diagnosed her with ADD and referred her to 2 others people for her other issues. She tabled her efforts at that point, and she brushes aside the topic anytime I have brought it up since. This is when I started giving up.

Now, she's been out of a job for nearly 3 months. She spends all day on hobbies, sending out 1 job application a week. She has given up on science as a career path and is now only applying for low-paying jobs with no room for advancement. She spent a month applying for unemployment, and now that it has been settled I fear that she will continue to stagnate further, since she does not prioritize the job search. She didn't even start applying for jobs until she had been out of her job for 1 month. I am getting the impression that she wants to wallow and go nowhere in life for awhile.

And that is not what I signed up for. I signed up for a strong woman with a good job and fiscal responsibility. I made it clear to her from day 1 that I want those exact qualities. And that's not who she is anymore, and not who she wants to be. She has changed, and I feel that we are now incompatible.

But I can't bring myself to let her go. She is dependent on me now (not financially), and I do love her very much. In the last month she has been much happier and has made efforts daily to make my life easier and happier. However she still makes no effort to get a job, and she seems to love this housewife lifestyle - and that's not what I want in a woman.

Help me, reddit. How do I even begin to deal with this? I am lost, so I have come to you.

12236,Relationships,21yych,"The foundation of our relationship was rocky, but doable. He was with me, but often acted like he didn't care to be. He has apologized profusely, has admitted he used to take me for granted, and has changed (a lot). However, it still affects me presently to the point of periodically crying over it. 

His brother is his best friend. His brother is also almost a deal-breaker for me. Family is so important to me, and since I consider my SO family, I would like to also consider his family, family. I cannot do that with his brother. I have never been made so insanely jealous over a single person in my life as I was his brother. 

At the beginning of our relationship, they lived together, worked together, combined all bills, went on expensive trips together, went out to eat, to movies, and shared a car together. It was difficult to spend time with my boyfriend without his brother being around. The level of interaction between them really mimicked interactions of a healthy marriage. But I persevered, because I really liked my boyfriend. 

When my boyfriend and I moved in together almost a year ago, his brother moved to a different state. I thought things would get better. They got worse. Within the last six months, I have had to encounter his brother twice. We had stayed a week with his brother out of state for Thanksgiving, and he had stayed with us for a week over Christmas. 

Over Thanksgiving, his brother treated me like crap. Consequently, I was very reluctant to agree to his brother staying at my house over Christmas. Especially after his brother notified us the night before that he was bringing over his non-potty trained dog. 

The real problem with my boyfriend's brother is that my boyfriend will defend any action his brother takes to the death. For example, his brother talked condescendingly to me in my SO's absence over Thanksgiving. My SO and I have fought about this at least 5 times (and each time he was saying that he could not control his brother's actions) before finally agreeing that if it happened again, he would let his brother know that is not welcome. My boyfriend was so reluctant to understand that when someone close to you disrespects your SO, they are also disrespecting you. 

Another example is over his brother's dog at Christmas time. It got into our dog's food (which was in a closed cupboard), and pooped all over our living room while we were out one night. I was angry that I had suggested we come back to let the dog out in the middle of our outing, and my idea was shot down by both of them (rudely by his brother). My boyfriend and I got into a fight that night, because he couldn't understand why I was so angry at an animal's fecal matter being all over the floor where I frequently walk barefoot. His brother did not clean the mess or buy carpet cleaner so that we could clean it. I expected him to, and my boyfriend did not. 

Over that Christmas, I asked my boyfriend if we could give presents to family members together, as it was an important bonding experience for me. He agreed, and said he would brainstorm ideas. I came home from work the next day, and he and his brother were Christmas shopping for family members together... He had forgotten to brainstorm what he and I should get his parents, and then he and I ended up getting his parents very similar items to what his brother and he had gotten them. It was inexplicably uncomfortable for me. 

My boyfriend and I hardly ever fight about anything unless it's about his brother. I can not even genuinely celebrate his brother's successes anymore, because he has become somebody I hate. They still have combined bills (which my boyfriend has used as an excuse not to combine bills with me). 

At this point in the relationship, I'm really not sure whether I want to continue the relationship (which is otherwise a pretty standard, healthy one) and doom myself to a lifetime of tolerating his marriage-like relationship with his brother. 

I love my boyfriend, but am no longer sure that our love is worth my trouble.

The guy admitted to saying it to my wife too because when  girl looks good I let them know, it's just how I am. Her lying went so far as to say he flubbed he never told me 'you look pretty today' but it doesn't matter because you won't believe me anyways. 

This was the last straw for me. It was this that allowed me to realize she has been manipulating me this *entire marriage* into thinking I was controlling and jealous. Even now she insists on saying they're just talking, but will also be quick to note that we are separated now so it's none of my business. She is now going on lockdown and trying to screw me out of our money and children. Don't be blinded by love, gentlemen, all women truly are like that after all. This was my Winnie Cooper, my bride I waited 4 years in our relationship for before we had sex on our wedding day.






My wife (28f) and I (28m) have been together for 11 years, married for almost 7 now. We have been together since high school and are each other's first experience for everything sexual (we waited until marriage to have sex). We have 4 kids together under 7 and recently moved to a new state that requires me to be a stay at home dad, and he confined home most of the time with no ability to make new friends or acquaintances. My wife is the only adult I know here.

As of right now our marriage is dying (it might be more accurate to say it is on life support with the doctor urging us to pull the plug). To be honest, I have been a shitty husband. For a while now (months or perhaps even years) I have ignored her needs and been selfish. I have always been insecure and a tad jealous (internally I don't feel like I deserve her), but recently she has lost the desire to put up with it. 

She has mentioned our sex life has become boring and she wants something more exciting, and that by exciting She really means other people. I have realized that this is a symptom of her not feeling close to me anymore because of my actions. Lately, she has begun to be friendly with male co-workers and I stupidly looked at her phone one day and didn't like what I saw. I confronted her about it and things haven't been the same since. There is one young co-worker in general I am worried about she swears she is friends with.

She told me she flirts with his good-naturedly (which I've always told her is ok), and told me a story about how she calls him Studly because all the other girls at work say he looks like a living Ken Doll. However, I (again, another violation of trust) noticed in her browser history she was looking up cute nicknames to call him. I scrolled through her list and saw a search query entitled cute nicknames to call your boyfriend. I clicked on one and my heart sank, #11 was Studly. I confronted her again and she swears up and down that she is bad at coming up with nicknames and the only way to find cute nicknames to call a guy is to search that way. I have decided to take the trusting route (again, I feel this is only fair because of what I've done to get here), and have chosen to take her word for it.

My issue here is the night this happened she didn't just threaten that we were through, she honestly...truly was done in our marriage. She told me she loves me but the passion and desire for me is gone. She is tired of arguments and my insecurity towards her. I understand I have brought these issues on myself and us; I am aware of this.

We are in an awkward phase of trying to get things back to normal (I asked her to give me 2 weeks to show things are different). She is very indecisive. She loves me and *wants* things to work, but I'm honestly worried whether I am just forcing her to try something that she can't get back.

Over this last week I've gone all out doing the sweet things I used to for her. I write her 10 different things I love about her and scatter them about the house every night when she gets home (she works the graveyard shift). When she gets to #10 she is met with a present I have spent a lot of time making (origami hearts, flowers, and suns. A hand made card with a sweet note made from scratch with cute characters and such which took me 4 hours since I'm not artistic). She is appreciative of these things. She makes sure she cuddled with me when she gets in bed when I'm asleep.

She lets me kiss her but obviously it's not the same. The passion and desire is there so it's almost like kissing a sibling on the lips. She lets me hug her, and while she hugs me back it is lacking, more like a friendly hug. Again, she *is* trying, it is apparent she is. But I don't know if I'm being too impatient or if I'm trying to fix something that has been irrevocably damaged.

I have told her I understand if she can't stay, I will *not* force her to stay. I know she's worried I will run away and leave her with the kids to her own devices, I've assured her I won't. I fear she's only staying for the kids. Today she told me my attempts to try and reconnect with her while she's home are causing me to smother her. We have been talking great as friends (or so I thought) but she just told me things are weird.

The reason I'm seeking advice for what to do is because I have asked only one thing of her through all this: If she really wants to try and make this work she *has* to fight for us (She cannot be a passive observer and expect things to get better she *has* to remind herself why she loves me). She has told me she's not sure if she can. I feel this is all the answer I need. Am I being too impatient trying to force too much to fast, or is this a hopeless endeavor?

I've been in a dating relationship for six months. Recently, I've been IMing a different girl [16F] from another state a lot (we attended a seminar together for a week about a month back). We almost immediately became very close, and are more comfortable talking to each other than I and my current GF are.

IM girl and I constantly joke and prod at each other (teasing). Over the last few weeks, it has felt like emotional cheating as our emotional bond is getting extremely intense. My feelings for my current GF are not diminished (though things have gotten boring as she has work obligations), but I feel emotionally more connected with IM girl. No sexual intentions/feelings, purely emotional.

This connection likely would not have developed if GF were not busy. Not to make excuses, it isn't ideal, but it's happened.

Tonight, IM girl began to indicate feelings towards me. She's inexperienced, so she ejected, but it became blatantly obvious.
My inclination tells me that I should break up with GF. I can't suppress the growing emotional bond with IM girl and I don't want to do damage to current GF's ability to trust emotional commitment, as this is her first relationship.

However, a breakup would come out of nowhere for her, and would likely do a lot of damage to her ability to trust people. Again, first relationship, and she is very invested despite her recent preoccupation.

However, when I introduced her to my friends, I got the vibe that she was flirting with one of them. I seriously don't know if this is me (because of my past experiences) or if she was really flirting. I confronted her about it (it took me a while) and she said she wasn't.

She is a photographer and she has a blog. She recently (about a week ago) posted some pictures of 2014, which include naked pictures of what must have been one of her boyfriends.. I'm not sure how to react to this. She hasn't given me the link, I found out on my own, and we have plans to go on vacation together next month...

I have tried to communicate with her but its just so hard. We don't chat online or anything, I prefer it that way though. When I've tried to talk about us, she says that we are clearly in the middle of something (after me trying to define what we have so that we have clear boundaries) and that trying to define it only messes things up.

But I guess these issues don't really have anything to do with me. The child, who is sweet and lovely, isn't mine and I have no say on anything that happens in her life. Her situation with her parents is chaotic but as far as anyone can tell she is not being mistreated.

She says she's saving herself till marriage, fine with me, we stick to strictly oral. And by oral I mean me giving and never receiving, because she says she's not ready to give me a bj. Again, fine with me, I love giving anyway. 

I don't need any bjs, I don't need any penetration, all I need is some reassurance from her that she wants me, it makes me feel good about myself ( had some traumatising experiences when I was young that led me constantly thinking I'm not good enough ) and she knows it. I've discussed all these at length with her before. 

So she gives me reassurance, purely in words in nothing else. 

I was out of town for a week, and on the day I was returning, a few hours before I go home, she sends me a naughty text, telling me how much she wants me. I reach home, and I get a ' nah don't feel like it. ' she says it so nonchalantly it hurts. 

We go out for a romantic dinner, on the way home, she describes elaborately how much she wants my tongue between her legs. She describes it as if it's the only thing she wants in the world. We reach home, I come out of the shower, and guess what. ' Baby, (movie name) is on now, let's watch a movie instead.' 

I talked to her about this before, and I got a lecture instead. Something about me unable to understand when she just don't feel like it, and that the whole relationship isn't just about sexual pleasures.

I've never forced her into it before, and I can understand if she doesn't feel like it. What I can't understand, is how she tell me how much she wants me, and end up preferring to watch a movie instead. 

I'm starting to think that she just says those words to ' reassure' me, but is unwilling to follow up with actions. The few times she allowed me down there, she moans and grabs me and whisper into my ear how good she feels, how she wants it everyday. The next day, it's back to nothing. 

Whenever she talk dirty to me but rejects me when I initiate, I'd feel disappointed. 

Other times when I do the rejecting, for example, last week when I had to submit a 12000 words essay 1 day earlier, because my electricity would be down the next day and I won't have Internet, she SMILIED. No disappointment, no nothing. She acted as if she was relieved. 

I asked her if she doesn't feel good when I go down on her, but she gets emotional and shouts at me and say that I'm accusing her of faking her moans, faking her orgasms, and I don't believe her whenever she says it feels good. Jeez lady, I would if you actually SHOWED me instead of telling me... 

How should I tackle this? Other than this, she's really amazing. We've only started being sexual recently, so I can't answer any ' was it like this in the past' questions. She's not on any form of birth control that may affect her libido.

I am one of the worst texters. Ever. 

I don't like texting unless its people I *really* don't want to talk to. I don't check my phone all day and most of the time I leave it at home because I feel like a phone is a constant ball and chain. Plus at work texting or using phones in general is a big no. It drives me nuts when people are constantly texting me. I would rather just talk face to face, Skype or over the phone.

Boyfriend is not much better with text. However, he is on a work trip for a couple of weeks and wants to stay in constant contact. Feelings on both sides have been hurt over texting and we are only half way through his absence.

I know this sounds silly, but I really want to have a concise, clear message for him to understand.

A bit of a background, her and I have been close friends ever since sophomore year of high school. It's getting near the end of our high school years as we are graduating in a few months. However, the places that we are going to college is only a couple hours apart.

The thing is, we had a summer fling last summer but she ended it after a couple weeks into the school year. We ended on good terms but some days I really find her irresistible. Some times during our classes she even gives off subtle cues to me too.

After our little fling, I dedicated myself to improve myself as a better man in hopes of getting over her. I've been scouring over the subreddits of getting over her and just overall being a better person. And in a way I succeeded and I feel my life has changed completely for the better. I've also shed from my 17 years of being shy and becoming more engaging and doing whatever I want to in life. Yet I still find myself incredibly attracted to her. I feel like that impulsive approach isn't going to do well if I asked her if she wanted to try one more time.

She's someone who I really adore but I am afraid to lose her as one of my closest friends if I approach this the wrong way.

The solutions I came up with personally is

1.Wait it out and just stay good friends while still constantly improving myself as a better person. If it's meant to be then it's meant to be. Although this kinda goes against my new, adopted just go for it approach towards life

2. Go for it and risk everything.

12257,Relationships,2ueby4,"Hello /r/relationships, I come to you today with more of a questioning, curious question than a serious problem. I hope what I'm asking is still relevant to this subreddit, and if not, please let me know where I could discuss this. I'm also not using an alt because, like I said, nothing serious going on here. Just wondering about the future and if anyone has gone through what my girlfriend and I are about to endure.

To start it off, I suppose some backstory is in order. My girlfriend and I met about three and a half years ago at my sophomore/her freshman homecoming dance.  I won't get too descriptive as that could take a book to complete, but basically we were paired up together by one of her friends to try to take her mind off her recently-made ex. Apparently it worked better than anyone could expect, because before we knew it we were actually making out right there on the dance floor. To this day I couldn't tell you how it happened, but we like to say it was fate (yea yea, we're pretty lame). Long story short, within the week I asked her if she wanted to go out, and thus began our magical journey to where we are today.

I suppose it's also important to point out the first year or so of our relationship. When we first decided to start dating, she informed me of some problems that she was having/had had in the past. I don't want to say too much about my girlfriend's emotional problems at the time, but just leaving it at that I'm sure you can picture what this means. My first reaction was that we'll work through it, and I told her I'd be there for her if she needed me. The next year was a long road of recovery and hardship for both of us, but one by one she was able to drop the hurtful things from her past. By the time our second year began, she was a new person, and we both knew that our relationship grew out of us helping each other through some very tough times. I hope this makes sense, as I don't feel comfortable describing just what she got past, but I'm sure you can understand the sentiment.

Fast forward to today; We're in a very healthy relationship and haven't had any serious problems that I can think of. Of course we fight, but we never go to bed angry. There aren't any issues, as I said, but this is where I get into my questions. This past school year I've been attending a local tech college, and she's working through her senior year of high school. I recently decided to transfer to a university this coming Fall semester, and her plan is to go to a university about two hours away from mine. The distance isn't really the biggest problem for me, and I think she would agree. Right now we figure we'll maybe have some weekends together, and I'm hoping that will work out every now and then. I have some friends at the university she's going to, so I'm sure I'll make time to visit all of them. We're both very excited for our future and can't wait to being college, even if that means time apart. That's where my curiousness begins.

My biggest concern, although I don't know if we've talked about this specific thing, is whether we'll change too much. The past three and a half years of my life have been amazing, and I honestly can say I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl. I hear stories about people dating since they were in high school and then going all the way, but I also hear of people breaking apart in college. I can't imagine that ever happening to us, but then people say that you don't truly know yourself until after your college years, and then some. Has anyone here gone through something like this? Do things really change that much in college? In our whole relationship, we've never once even gotten close to breaking up, and we've always been each other's best friend. When people tell us that it's crazy to expect a high school relationship to last, we always ask Well why not? We know each other better than some married couples who only dated for a year, and we've stay truer to each other than many other couples. I get worried when people talk about high school relationships but then I take a look at what we have and what we've gone through to get here and I don't think we have to worry at all. We've talked about getting married some day, living together, having kids, growing old. Some people seem to think this is just silly childish love but I say after almost four years of neverending love don't you think this is as real as it can get? I understand I'm starting to ramble, and maybe that's all I needed right now, but I hope I'm getting my point across in some way.

The next few years of our life may be tough; we may not see each other as often as we'd like, there may be fighting, school could hold us apart...but I honestly think we can make it. I guess at the end of all of this I'd just like to hear what some other people have to say about a situation such as ours. Have you gone through the high school relationship? Did it work out? Have you seen someone work through it? Or what other thoughts do you have? I appreciate anyone reading this, I'm sure it's incredibly long by now. Thank you for any help and inspiration you can bring us!

P.S. Let me know if I left anything important out, I'd be happy to share more!

12258,Relationships,1jfbn6,"This sounds shadier than it is, but essentially I have been starting a boardgaming group at my new location. I just moved up here and meeting new friends from work (2 guys) have joined in....however as most people may or may not know with board games = the more the merrier.

My girlfriend has agreed to join in too (Although Im not sure she will like it). Anyways my conundrum is that I need more players to join, and I want to make this sort of a regular thing that people come to my apartment and do. So I have one of the new guys girlfriends, and then a girl I knew from college that im good friends with (She has a b/f).

Here's the issue: At one point my girlfriend....well was a bit overly jealous, I'd occasionally talk to this girl because we were good friends....nothing romantic but she would occasionally ask about a video game. She liked me in college (which was around 5 years ago) but I was never interested and we stayed good friends). She has a b/f now, as I have a g/f for a year now. Regardless my g/f had a fit one day when she had texted me asking me about something completely random (Like a video card recommendation or something). I was a bit taken back...and since then i've kinda leered away from talking to her (Which is silly because we are friends, and my g/f has a GUY friend that she's been friends with for ever.....and I have no issue with that).

My g/f has since then become wayyyy less jealous and alot calmer (alot of it came from an old cheating ex b/f) but still....is it wrong to invite her and her b/f to come to our gaming group. She has actively been trying to find a board gaming group and Im looking for more people, so ideally it works out well? But I don't know if it's douchey for my to invite her and her b/f to the game nights.

Advice?

12259,Breakups,1rwkm1,"We've been dating for so long and we both get a lot of happiness from each other, and i genuinely love her but there is so much wrong with the way our relationship has been going lately I'm just not sure if we can recover.

We literally used to be the perfet couple, never fought, just made each other laugh and enjoyed a fulfilling sex life, we scoffed when people warned us about the honeymoon phase. We went through some hard times, an abortion being the worst of it, but we always seemed to bounce back to some level of normalacy. But now everything's crazy and i don't know what to do.

We started fighting because I revealed something I told her months before was a lie (she kept telling me to go to the doctor because of a cold, I just like to let those things pass, but she kept insisting so i just told her I went). I honestly didn't see what the big deal was (i was raised with the saying a little white lie never hurt anyone) but I promised to change, and I did, I became crazy honest and started opening up to her more. I messed up once when I was napping and she called me and asked if i had just woken up, I said no but told her the truth almost immediately after (wasn't trying to get out of trouble for being caught naping, was just confused from just being woken up), but that started another big fight.

Also I should mention that these fights tend to just be her telling me how horrible I am and me appologizing over and over.

Then when she started back at school she was afraid that we wouldn't be able to see each other that much i work retail a good amount), and we almost broke up that night, but i promised to make time to see her, so I started going with her to some of her classes and hanging out before work started (I even offered to head over to her place when I worked closing shifts (9pm) but she refused because she still lived with her parents.) We would still have fights every now and then but things seemed to be, on the whole, ok.

And then our most recent fight happened last week, she said that we were growing apart and weren't spending enough quality time together (when I brought up me going to school with her she said that it didn't count, and it was almost like a tease, and worse than not hanging out at all, whih kind of frustrated me but whatever). We had been also having some problems in the bedroom recently, with me not being able to get fully errect mot of the time, she started to get really insecure about this but i told her that it was entirely due to my anxiety medication dose being increased (moving down to a slightly lower dose hs proven I was right). So to spend better quality time together I cancelled plans I had ade with people and basically forced her to hang out with me, which turned out great, we laughed, cuddled, had great sex (thanks to new lower pill dose), and thing seemed to be turning around. The next day I tried to suprise her at this place she volunteered at with some of her favorite tea but she was out sick (she still said she appreciated it though), the next day I made her dinner and took her to the movies (and once again had great sex).

 Then today she texts me that I don't make her feel special. And then we fight. I forget to mention that I tried to surprise her with tea just a few day ago, wish I did, but I still don't see where she's coming from at fucking allllll. I'm just so stressed and tired from all of this. I feel like I'm putting so much into the relationship and getting no appreciation for it. She does make me happy when I see her in person, but then she starts talking about how unhappy she is and I try to fix it but I can't and it's driving me crazy.

Also, I don't know exactly when this started but during fights or when she would be feeling insecure she would always frame things like you don't love me or you don't find me pretty and it just is annoying because I do love her and thinks she's pretty but she tells me that i don't and just ajkdhflkjjfh. Also she once spent a night telling me to break up with her (which i opposed), but when i asked if she wanted me to break up with her it started another big fight. And just lately, within the past couple of months she just has started to get mean when stressed or anxious, eg calling me an idiot for honest mistakes, making fun of me for not being in university (left for financial reasons), and other stuff that just bugs me like calling me asshole sometimes when we are joking around (i've asked her to stop but she still does this because she's just kidding, but her tone when she says it hurts), or she'll pretend to be mad at me and commit to it, making it go on way to long and just making me feel bad (it's gotten to the point where i've had to ask her if she is really mad at me, a couple of times in fights).

So that's all the bad stuff about our relationship. Sorry it got kind of ramble-y and dis-jointed at the end but i'm tired and emotional. I guess what I need is an outside perspective, tell me if I'm crazy or something. Maybe some advice on how to break up with her, because despite everything I still love her like crazy and want her to be happy (there were a lot of good times that I omitted)

12260,Dating,2bcpwt,"I have finally decided to get back on the dating scene again after a bad relationship. I feel confident enough again to at least *try* to date. I'm a very awkward, stereotypical nerdy girl so I find dating to be difficult.

I work with a very close coworker/friend, I'll call Megan. I was chatting with Megan a couple of days ago, telling her about how I'm ready to start dating again, but since I'm so awkward and shy, I'd probably have to go back to online dating, like Geek2Geek, (where I met my previous boyfriend)

She immediately lit up and said that she knew someone that would be *perfect* for me! He is apparently her fiance's best-friend. She showed me a picture and told me about Kyle. He's tall, handsome, soft spoken, extremely kind, has the same sense of humor as I do, and likes almost all the same things, movies, music, food, fun stuff, other than my love for video games, he has a love for weight-lifting. (Hey, we have to have our me hobbies, right?) Oh, and she causally ended it with Oh an he has schizophrenia.

I put my hypothetical brakes on immediately. I have known of two people with schizophrenia in my life. One of them was a former coworker's son, who would go stand in the produce section at Walmart and scream at the ceiling or would be found naked in the fields outside of city limits all the time talking to his friends, and the other is the boyfriend of another coworker's daughter. He constantly beats her and my coworker, and knows they're in the FBI so he tries to tear the wires off of them. Though I would like to note that those two, I know for a fact never took their medicine.

Megan keeps reassuring me that You can't even tell he has it! I think he was misdiagnosed! She says her nor her fiance have ever seen him have a stereotypical schizophrenic rage before, and he takes his pills like he is supposed to. She says every once in a while he will become a big sad lump and sit on his couch feeling hopeless and not caring about the world. Apparently he was diagnosed when he was around puberty. He was playing baseball, then suddenly sat all his stuff down, went and sat on the bench, and proclaimed that he felt hopeless and just didn't care anymore. This is what confuses me. I have depression, which I am on medication for, and to me, this sounds just like symptoms of depression! Apparently he's had girlfriends and dated in the past, but as soon as he finally confessed to him that he had this disorder, they all bailed on him.

I want to give him a chance, but everyone I talk to tells me to stay away from him, because he is crazy and will end up killing me in my sleep. My parents told me I shouldn't, a nurse at my workplace (I work in a nursing home) told me I shouldn't, a couple friends told me the same, and even my ex told me I still care about you enough not to let you be near some psycho that's going to kill you. Their 'medicine' doesn't do shit.

I don't think it's fair to Kyle. It's not his fault he has this problem, no more than it's my fault I have depression, or bad eyes, or asthma. I really want to give Kyle a chance, but I will admit that I am scared that he might possibly have an episode or something and hurt me, or worse. I also don't want to hurt his feelings if we would start talking and then something happens to scare me off, because I know all too well what it's like to not have anyone give you a chance because you're different.

Does anyone have any experience with anything like this? Should I give it a shot and see where it goes? Any advice on anything about schizophrenia?  I do want to move slowly in my next relationship/dating, whether it be Kyle or someone else.

Sorry if any of this seemed rude or non politically correct or insensitive to anyone. I do not have a way with words. :(

I should also note that the two other schizophrenics I knew were unemployable and needed to live with other people or in government housing, whereas Kyle has a job as a chef at a restaurant and has his own home by himself and license/vehicle.

12261,Relationships,1pw9ic,"**My girlfriend is of the mindset** that we should both make an effort to enjoy the things that the other person likes. To that end, she has done several things that she doesn't necessarily like doing but tries them for the sake of enjoying something I like together.

**I am of a different mindset.** I don't want anyone to feel obligated to do something they have no interest in. In fact, I prefer if they don't because it has the potential to decrease others' enjoyment.

___

**Let's have an example - one for her, one for me.**

**Her example.** She likes historical drama movies and vampire drama movies (e.g., Anna Karenina and Twilight, respectively). I have absolutely no interest in either of these genres. It's not impossible for me to enjoy parts of movies like the ones I listed, and I have no problem with her liking the things she likes, but if I join her in watching one of those movies, it feels impossible for me to share her level of excitement and enjoyment and this will likely result in an overall negative experience (potentially for both of us). The times I have watched these movies with her, I will usually fall asleep or will only be able to think of my criticisms - both bad outcomes for her. It would be entirely disingenuous of me to act like I am enjoying them and share her excitement.

**My example.** I have a few interests that she doesn't entirely share, but she has made the effort to enjoy these things for the sake of (I assume) spending time with me. That's great! She is a great girl for wanting to do that. With that said, I would prefer that she didn't. The movie Ender's Game just came out and I was a HUGE HUGE HUGE fan of the books growing up and am so excited to see the movie adaptation. She, on the other hand, has not read the book and doesn't really care to see the movie, but volunteered to go see it (with the first implied and later explicit expectation that I should go see one of her movies). I really would rather see this movie with the people I know who loved the book and will share the same excitement I have for the movie rather than someone going only for the sake of spending time together / sharing interests / getting me to watch a movie I don't like later. My examples have all been movies so far, but the same can be said for other things. I love League of Legends and play it a lot - I am competitive too. My girlfriend started playing it for the sake of spending time with me, but I find playing with her is very frustrating because she doesn't acknowledge her own mistakes and has an overall bad attitude when playing. Overall, my experience is NOT GOOD with both her watching a movie that only I like or her playing a game that only I like. I commend the effort, but I prefer to find things we both enjoy and leave be the things only one of us enjoys.

**The last thing my girlfriend said on the subject was** I'm tired of making an effort to enjoy the things you like and you not doing the same. I really feel bad about this because I recognize that she does make this effort, and I don't. She is right. I just don't agree with why she is putting in that effort. I consider it disingenuous and harmful. I want to enjoy things we both like together rather than force-feed each other the things only one of us likes. And it's not like we wouldn't be doing stuff at all together if not for her effort. There are plenty of movies we both want to see. There are video games we both enjoy playing. There are activities we both like doing. So, what should I do? Should I concede to her line of thinking? Should I try to better explain mine? I don't really see a compromise here. I guess I could just do things she wants to do and ask her not to do things only I want to do, but she isn't assertive enough to ask for things like that and it will default to the current situation.
___

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend thinks we should do stuff together that only one person likes (and alternate doing so). I think we should only do things together that we both like. She has been exercising her attitude, and I have been exercising mine. This is leaving her frustrated with the fact that she is the only one putting in the effort in these cases, but there are enough things we both enjoy that leave me wondering why we have to share things that only one of us enjoys.

**EDIT** Well I'm getting somewhat conflicting opinions so far. Some say I am being close minded and part of being in a relationship means putting in the effort to enjoy something new that your partner enjoys. And the others say that my girlfriend and I shouldn't feel obligated to do something we don't enjoy - making it a chore - because it's okay to have things you enjoy together, things you somewhat enjoy together, and things you don't enjoy together and keep separate.

I never thought I would be the guy who isn't wanted by the girl's father. It's a shitty feeling. I mean he said to me on the phone tonight Please dont ever see her again. Thank you. He *thanked* me. 

If anyone of you could share some of your experiences with a-hole in laws or d-bag fathers, please do. I'm all ears. I love this girl with all my heart, and I'd rather try to make this a success story.

12263,Breakups,1x18g5,"Where to start. Well I guess how we got together, she had a boyfriend and I respected that but we would hang out and go to the store And load up on junk food. I realized I had feeling for her when she cut her hand on her phone because of the screen (it was broke). I went into full protective mode, buying water and bandages and such. She told me her boyfriend would never do that. He broke up with her the next week and she being unstable, tried to kill herself. I had no idea until she came back a month later and we sat on the playground and cried together. And the next days me cheering her up. Soon she was over and she was better so we started dating.

About 3.5 months later and its close to love she gets sent to the psychiatric hospital because her mother and step father were arguing and yelling etc. And she cut her leg out of stress. While she was there they gave her a journal, she wrote the whole thing to me full of emotions. I then realized I love her. 

Fast forward about 3 months, we start arguing more and more mainly about her not trusting me (last bf was an asshole and cheated on her). So this new girl came and I wanted advice. Little did I know this girl was cunning. Shed point out all the bads that were going on. Making me doubt everything so I ended it. So much crying between us two for a week straight everyday. I gave up.

Soon this girl I went to for advice started liking me, me and the ex were arguing so I went out with this girl do piss her off because were fighting. I didn't like her like a gf but it happened. I kept the journal hoping one thing would happen. Everyday I'd read it. My gf at the time found it and flipped. But I still kept it. I broke up with her.

Soon I couldn't torture myself with the journal so I asked her if she wanted it back after she snapped saying no I dont fucking want it go burn it She apologized after I said sorry and goodbye. And we talked about all the memories we had and went nostalgia. Her crying and me crying. So we decided to longboard (to give her the journa) to catch up but sit at the playground and we talked, we both choked and froze repeatedly. I couldn't stand talking to get and not being together and her talking about her current bf, u made up some excuse, crying while I walk away I look back and see her reading the journal crying. I left not being able to talk and now I'm outside my house looking up at the stars.

12264,Infidelity,1hjhlk,"I don't know if it's important, but this is a throwaway account.

About a year ago I met this great guy online. We clicked almost immediately, but in the 'friend' way, or at least so I thought. From the outset I told him that I was interested in women, and that I very much wasn't looking for a relationship with him. He said he was cool with that, and we just basically hit it off brilliantly and had a great time talking about the sort of general stupid shit you do with any of your friends. Movies, music, computer shit, etc. 

However, there was always this really kind of seedy underside to him that was, bluntly, evident from the start. He asked a shitload of questsions about my breasts, and they were always really sexualized and super personal. At first I was really bothered by it, but over time I just kind of stopped caring because he was generally such a fun guy to hang out with (I know, I know...mistake #1). Eventually it came out that he'd actually found me by (I swear this is true) literally searching for a cupsize/bandsize combination and then finding a post I'd made once upon a time back when I was really stupid and had forgotten about and so hadn't deleted once I was old enough to know better, and then messaging me directly while 'forgetting' to mention how he'd found me. And, again, somehow this didn't send up a giant red flag for me.

After a few months he started pushing hard towards cybersex. I was between relationships, he was fun, and most importantly he lives in Switzerland and I live in the US (the locations will be pretty important later) so he never really felt threatening or anything, so after a while I said yes. It was never really the defining feature of our friendship, but it definitely became a significant undercurrent, and probably at least once a week we'd have fun like that. That's been going on for over half a year now, going on a full year. Over time, things got heavier, and he started talking about how he was getting 'obsessed' (his word) with my tits, and that he was starting to think about them a lot even when he wasn't online, hadn't been talking with me, etc., even saying that he had started to imagine the clothes of every woman he saw on my frame to imagine how they'd look. And, again, amazingly this didn't scare me off. 

Then the real problem started. He was coming to the US. Ohhhh, shit. I like the guy well enough, and having fun with him online was cool, but he also gave off enough 'creepy' vibes that even I wasn't stupid enough to not pick up on that I was just no way in hell going to meet this guy IRL. Even worse, I knew that this guy already had a thing for the part of the US I live in and so there was a really bad chance he was going to be flying out to basically exactly where I live. So I decided to get the hell out of Dodge, and asked him when he'd be out and where he'd be so I could go on an unavoidable vacation to see my very sick aunt on the other side of the country or something. And, hey, turns out he wasn't going to be anywhere near me! Crisis averted, right?

Wrong. See, now that I knew he wasn't coming over to try and turn e-friends-with-benefits into have-my-children, I thought we were back to being normal old chums and asked him why he was going to that particular part of the US. Turns out he was going to Canada and just swinging by part of it. Huh. Given his personality and interests, that was a really odd choice of vacation destinations. What lead him up there? Oh, to see this woman he'd been in this technically-not-dating-but-she-was-super-obviously-in-love-with-him with for like a year. See, back when she'd flown out to visit him a few months ago and they'd slept in the same bed together she'd invited him out to come visit her and so now he was going to take her up on that. Oh, and also he had feelings for her as well, but they weren't really dating yet or anything. I mean, people totally fly across the Atlantic to spend weeks alone with each other and share beds all the time when they aren't in relationships! 

WHAT. THE. FUCK.

And today I get an email from him. He was back from Canada and oh, hey, good news! She finally talked him into actually formally dating her. Yay! And I mean that sincerely. I am legitimately happy for her, because the way he talked about her it was obvious that she really had a thing for him, and had for a while now. But don't worry, MyRealName, nothing had really changed, there was just this new name attached to the relationship, nothing was actually different. And you know what? I'm pretty sure that's right. I'm certain that nothing really has changed between them, because now that I've actually gotten him talking about this the stuff I'm hearing from him makes it clear they've essentially been dating for probably like six months.

Six months in which he's been having cybersex with me. And getting at least two handjobs that I know of from a woman IRL that he was sort of playing with but wasn't serious with. And based on shit he's said I know for a fact that I wasn't the only one he was cybering with, either, and there's enough of those partners that they can't all be this one person he's dating now. Now, if he's actually found someone to be with romantically, I'm happy for him. But I'm worried about her.

See, she doesn't know any of this. She thinks he's been hers and hers alone this whole time. And I am NOT okay with this. I come from a super evangelical background, and while I've basically left that behind, I'm still in agreement with it that cheating is basically The Worst Thing. I've already flat-out told him that the cybering is going to stop, and that if he ever even hints at it again I'm blocking him, but part of me thinks that I'm being too soft here. 

Part of me wants to block the fucker here and now for using me to cheat on his girlfriend with, and the technicality of when he actually started using the label of 'relationship' be damned. This is the option that I'm leaning very heavily towards right now. I mean, I KNOW that he knows it bothers me, because when I was briefly dating someone else we cut out the cybering for the explicit reason that I was not okay with anything even vaguely resembling cheating. And yet that's what he was doing the whole time.

On the other hand...this guy has basically become one of my best friends. Maybe my best friend. He's one of a very, very small number of people I'm out of the closet to (like I said, super evangelical background, so this is a huge deal for me), and he's been really supportive of me as I stumble my way through understanding myself and my orientation when I don't really have have anyone else to turn to. There's been days when I honestly don't know what I would have done if he hadn't been there. He is legitimately important to me, and losing him, if and when that happens, is going to hurt like hell. Even if I stay strictly platonic friends with him, though, I'm moderately certain that he's probably going to be doing the same shit he was with me with other women, because that just kind of basically seems to be what he does whenever he's got any spare time at all.

And so I'm feeling stuck. I don't want to lose him, but I can't be friends with someone who's basically been using me to cheat on his girlfriend with.

12265,Breakups,1r4otu,"On Sunday, the girl that I saw myself sharing my life with Skyped me from Geneva (where she's on a 6-month internship, post-graduation) to end things. This was a month after leaving the west coast - I couldn't follow her, since I'm still in school (two years behind her since I switched into Engineering). 

Everything was fine before she left, and even a few weeks in. We originally said that after I graduated we would go off around the world together. 

Now, the thing is that she's a TCK (if anyone identifies with that, I could really use your advice). She's been moving around since she was a baby, every 3-4 years to a different country. University was the longest she's ever been in one place. She was getting the itch to get out again, and so when her friend in Geneva mentioned she could get her an internship there, she up and left. I don't blame her for leaving - it was an amazing opportunity - but I kind of expected what we had to have a bit more weight. To be clear, I didn't expect her to stay, but I thought that we would find a way to make it work. I could have done internships abroad, and worked anywhere in the world after school.


Her rationale was that she wasn't happy in the city we went to school - the people here aren't like her. And now that she's in Geneva, she says she's found herself again. She said that she relied solely on me for her happiness here. She also said that now that she's being exposed to this new world, and doesn't really know where she wants her career to go, she wants some time to grow as an individual and let work/school take her wherever she needs to go.
She kept reiterating how much she loves me, and is sorry for being selfish. She is genuinely upset. I don't believe she's met someone else, or that there were that big of problems with our relationship. We've done long distance before. It sucked, but we got through it (what did people do before Skype??).


So I guess what I'm wondering - and I know it's hard to say since you don't know us - is how I should be reacting. Of course I want her to be happy. But on the other hand, I feel like I was just deftly discarded at the first sign of this exciting vagabond life she's always wanted. I love her, so much. I would literally have done anything for her. She said on that call that she didn't want to make me move away from everything and drag me around the world with her - that it was unfair to me - but I was so ready to follow her wherever.

To be honest, I'm just so confused. This really did come out of nowhere. I knew she wanted to move away from our university city, but so do I once I finish. There is an outside possibility that she could find herself back near the city I'm in after her internship is over. ~~Am I a fool for still wanting her in my life?~~ 

Really, anything you have to say would mean a lot to me.

**EDIT**
Thanks for your responses everyone. The confusion over how to feel was one of the worst parts of this, and you all have really helped me focus on the details that really matter. Again, thank you everyone :)

I've been with my current girlfriend for nearly two years now. I've very into science and technology while she is very arty. I don't really feel that we have so many common interests. 
It can be frustrating when I notice something in the world, and she just can't see it; for example she couldn't explain to me what caused the Coriolis effect. I don't think that she's stupid at all, we both go to Cambridge. She just seems to lack common sense about the natural world.

She often feels that she is 'stupid' or 'unsuccessful'.

On the other hand, we are excellent at keeping each other company and both love each other very dearly. She is kind, generous and funny.
I can't help but feel that this is near the minimum of what makes a great partner. Most people can be kind and keep one from feeling lonely.

I've recently been offered a dream job in another country for after my degree and I'm worried that if we end this now I won't be able to find another companion like her before leaving.

I'm becoming very sad about this. We've spoken a little on the topic of shared interests, but I don't think that she knows the full extent of my feelings. We discussed trying new things together, and listed a number of things that we have in common. I don't know if any number of new things can make her more curious about the universe.

Sorry if this was a little scatterbrained :/

I did not think that I would ever be interested in someone younger than me but we hung out one day in May this year, and he swept me off my feet. At first, I was against dating him because I was about to leave for college and I also wasn't sure if I wanted to pursue a relationship with a younger guy. But, we kept talking and eventually we started dating officially in June.

Now, Adam (my boyfriend) has problems with his parents. They do not have a good relationship, and frequently get into fights where they send him away to a relative's house. On July 4, Adam had the biggest fight to date with his parents. Now, they both trigger each other. They attempt to control every part of his life, and in return, he gets extremely angry. This time, the fight escalated, he damaged a piece of furniture in his room, and they locked him out of the house. Because Adam has had a suicide attempt in the past, they worried for his health and had the police come and take him to the hospital to detain him. He was released that night though because they found that he wasn't a harm to anyone. Both Adam and his parents were told to attend an outpatient counseling program together.

Adam's parents decided that they didn't want him in the house while he was attending the program so for two weeks, he was shipped around to different family member's houses. During this time, I was unable to see him. His mother, in another attempt to control every action of his, called MY parents and told them that we couldn't talk anymore. Long story short, it was a miscommunication and after Adam returned home, I was able to see him again. I tell you this just to give you a back story of the troubles we've been through in this relationship..

Now, I'm away at college two and a half hours away as a freshman, while he is a junior in high school. If his parents weren't enough of an issue already, we have now decided to add long distance into the equation. As for a back story on me, I have anxiety and depression problems that I am on medication for. This is relevant. Ever since I've left for college, I have been constantly questioning my feelings for Adam. I'm happy when I'm skyping with him and I'm happy when I visit him, but I'm constantly asking myself when I'm away how do you feel about A right now? How about now? Do you love him right now? They're obsessive, intrusive thoughts.

I don't know if this is normal for a long distance relationship or not. But I really can't settle on just feeling what I'm feeling. I constantly feel as if I have to put a label on it. Last night, we fought about a situation with his parents almost to the point of breaking up, but I just couldn't do it. I genuinely care about him. He really is an amazing boyfriend and has never treated me with any amount of disrespect. Do I feel butterflies? No. Do I have to? I don't know. I'm extremely comfortable with him, and from the start, he chased me so I never had to worry about where the relationship was going.

I'm scared because I don't know if this questioning is normal, if it means that I don't care about him anymore, if it means I should end the relationship. Because I don't want to. I would love to be madly in love with him. But there have been so many problems. When in a relationship, are you supposed to be one hundred percent happy all the time? Is questioning okay? And we've only been together three months, so is that even enough time to completely madly fall in love with someone?

12270,Breakups,27y459,"So, here's the whole deal on what has been happening. The love of my life, let's call her Jane, and myself underwent some horrible changes during the 3 years we were together. The first year and a half was great, until I re-located states to be with this girl at her University, and since then my mental health had been declining rapidly.


I've been a sufferer of severe depression and a host of mental issues I'm sure I don't know about since I was 14 years old, and I feel like this catalyzed how things went. For a long time, Jane took care of me when I was hitting rock bottom and tried to do pretty horrible things to myself. It got to the point where I got complacent with this care, and I was so used to it that I expected it. I started not really paying attention to her and giving her much love because I was so busy studying to finish my degree, which was in stark contrast in how she treated me. I felt like I gave her practically nothing, and I wasn't my old self anymore and the person she fell in love with. During the course of the past few months, I've basically been treating her really badly. As a result, we both let each other go as far as how we treated each other. We would both get verbally abusive, and I would lose my cool very easily. 


We broke up about 3 weeks ago now, and during this break up that I didn't think was serious (it was happening once a month), Jane drunkenly had a one night stand with somebody she didn't know. I was devastated when I found the news, and basically had to start a new life. I moved back to my home state for the summer, quit my job, just to be with my family and get some therapy. 


Jane was very guilty about what she did, and she really still can't come to terms with how things happened and why she did it. But she had been confiding with her close friends that she was no longer happy with the way I was treating her for the past year and a half, and every time we broke up I still clinged on when she knew she probably shouldn't continue on. I basically kept it on life support for a long time.


I started on some SSRI's that have been somewhat helping, but since then I also started taking muay thai lessons and I've basically been trying really hard to overcome my mental warfare. Slowly but surely, I've been coming to the realization that I can't be too upset with her about what happened and I had my fair share of fuck ups. To be honest, this girl is the love of my life and we both made mistakes.  I'm taking some time off and I haven't spoken to her, but I really want to try this again some time in the future once I'm healed and stable. I still believe she is the one for me. Is this a bad idea?

---

I've known my now ex, let's call him Andrew, for three years now and have basically stuck with him since. To make a long story short, in High School I was struggling hard in my final year to graduate and turned to him for guidance. He was a well-respected member among our community and he was receptive to me looking for a mentor. 

---

Soon it became a sexual relationship which, at the time [18], was a very new and exciting experience. We played games to motivate me to finished my school projects and I can confidently say that he is the reason I was able to graduate high school and pursue my military career.

---

I say it was only a sexual relationship because at the time Andrew was in a romantic relationship with someone else. They had an open-relationship though so his partner was fine with our activities.

---

Fast forward two months after graduation, I ship off to Basic Training. We spend a last day together, kiss, say we love each other, and say goodbye. Having him back home while I was a way really helped me push through my training. I wrote letters to him frequently and day dreamed about spending time together afterwards.

---

Throughout Basic and my job training, we stayed in close contact. Basically from then until my first duty station Andrew was the first person I always went to if I had an issue or needed guidance. As the months went on though I soon felt that I was pestering him more than anything. I got many short replies and slow responses, I shrugged it off and continued to try and stay positive.

---

Early 2014, things start going south. I began playing games with him where I would ignore him for days at a time to see if he would respond back. I know that was a poor and childish way to go about it but I was desperate for his attention. I didn't realize it then but having invested so much reliance on him, I made very few close connections outside of Andrew. I didn't trust my personal issues with anyone else, and that is going to bite me in the back later on in this.

---

This is where I actually began a brief romantic relationship with Andrew. It's also the time where I began developing the early stages of alcoholism. It was a bad time and as I always have for the past two years, I went to Andrew for help. It wasn't like before though, I can't describe it well but I didn't have the trusted mentor vibe from him anymore. Maybe it was because we moved from a student/mentor relationship to a mutual and equal friends. But I had already invested all of this trust in him that I went to severe lengths to get his attention and to feel cared for.

---

It eventually led to a horrible night of drunken self harm as a plea for help with my depression. And even sooner after that I Skyped him one night and drunkenly asked him to be my boyfriend. He agreed which made me so incredibly happy, but in hindsight it was some serious foreshadowing of the months to come.

---

I sought out help after that for my depression and alcoholism, but I did not take the classes seriously because I didn't believe I was an alcoholic yet. I left that program thinking I was fine to continue use.

---

Fast forward to mid 2014, after months of continuing to pry for what felt like un-fulfilled love, I ended our romantic relationship on the recommendation of my therapist. She told me I wasn't getting the physical love that I needed (which makes sense, it was long distance) and that I should tell him this. He took it well and jumped straight back into the friendship mode we had before. I was happy to have such a mellow break-up. The next few months, however,  we basically still treated each other as partners aside from the official title. That is when I also found out that my unit will be deploying.

---

I was excited for this opportunity, but Andrew didn't share the enthusiasm but knew this is what I wanted. I was even more excited about being able to take leave and visit him one more time before I left.

I'm still quite obsessed with him at this point and decided that instead of visiting my family before I leave, I would take time off to visit him and his friends. I don't know why I wanted to at the time, but I may have been hoping to re-kindle things (even though we agreed that would not happen during the visit) or at least see if my therapist was right in that I needed physical affection to feel cared for.

---

The day arrives and I fly out to visit him, we talked before hand that he would limit my alcohol intake, as I was still failing horribly to control my alcoholism. 

---

The first few days are fine, but I'll save you the details and say the end of the week ended horribly due to my alcoholism. I made more than one huge mistake and left a horrible impression on many friends, including Andrew. 

---

So I leave with a horrible taste in my mouth and horrible guilt of what I had done and hardly remember because I wasn't able to control myself. I spent a lot of time keeping to myself in shame and leaving him to his life. This is when I began to get jealous.

---

At this point (Mid-September) I am still following him on social media, I see that he has taken a crush on a trip to visit him, all at his expense. He travels frequently and is able to afford luxury privileges with airlines. So I see messages from both him and his crush, let's call him Ian. All I see from Ian are messages of being charmed by how nice Andrew is treating him. I try not to pay mind to it but when Ian made the visit over there, that's all I seemed to focus on. Andrew and Ian's back and forth's of romance and crush talk on social media. I couldn't bear it and I felt very replaced. I felt like I deserved it though for what I had done during my visit. Ian was older, he was also mentored by Andrew at some point, and above all else, Ian could control himself with alcohol.

---

Late September, I learn I am able to make a trip again to Andrew's area for a huge social event. I bring it up with him (after spending the last few weeks at a distance, albeit from jealously asking him about Ian's visit) and that I could go. He tells me bluntly that if he sees me under the influence at this event that he would report me to security because I am under-aged.

---

Maybe it's the alcoholic mind-set to be so off put by this tough love approach, I became angry with him. Fine, I said. I won't see him at this event but still enjoy it (and drink) because this was my last big social event before I go overseas. My military friends agreed that I should go and just avoid Andrew and have a good time.

---

So I go, I make last minute reservations and attend the event. 

---

Long story short (a lot happened), I fail myself again and piss off Andrew and fail to control myself and go over the limit on two occasions.  The first night I decide to cut off all contact with Andrew and block him from my social media. Still at the event, I learn that he has publically asked all of his friends at the event to report me as well if they see me drunk at the event. I bat it off as they won't find me, I'll be fine.

---
Well, on the last day of the event, they found me, I'm reported. The staff of the event are lenient and decide to just send me off to my room with a warning and tell me to sleep off the night. The next hour of the event is hazy and I'm still missing the memories. But I didn't stay in my room and made a loud commotion (which included several threats of suicide) which eventually led to the hotel security and local police to take me away from the event and admit me to a hospital. 

---

This was by far the darkest moment of my life. I miss my flight due to being admitted to the hospital and end up causing grief with my command because I would not be accounted for the next day at work (big deal in the military). I spend the next day miserable in the hospital waiting for my father (who took a two hour flight here to sign me out) so I could take a red-eye back to my duty station.

---

When my dad arrives, he signs me out and we spend an awkward hour together driving to the airport for my red-eye. He tells me that he doesn't think I should be dating men anymore and that I should stop talking to Andrew because I always seemed to have talked about him in a negative light (because Andrew almost solely went into tough love mode since we broke up). I agreed, but also because I was ashamed of myself  for what I had done and didn't want to bother Andrew anymore with my problems. On the inside though, I was also angry at him for doing this to me. I blamed him for reporting me and causing all this stress with my work.

---

At the airport, after not speaking directly with Andrew for the weekend, he texts me telling me he hopes I can finally see how dark things have become and that my friends (including him) do worry about me and my well-being and just want me to get better.

---

The conversation is brief and that's when I tell him I no longer want to be friends and ask him to enjoy his life and find a new partner to love. I wasn't upset or angry anymore, I legitimately felt okay with ending it and hoping the best for him. He just ends it with letting me though that he will always be there for me and if I ever need anything I can message him. 

---

I hear from friends the next day that he wasn't expecting that and was rather stressed about the situation. I made no promises to seek help for my alcoholism because I blamed a majority of it on simply being underage. I had plans to continue alcohol use after my deployment.

---

Now I begin preparing for my deployment. As I gather my belongings, I decide to send all of the sentimental items (mostly stuffed animals I used to help me sleep) Andrew gave me over the years back to him with a message asking him to not contact me after he received them. It was cold to do, but I couldn't stand holding onto those items anymore. It felt right, like I was giving closure. 

---

Now we're basically up to today. After seeing more posts from Ian who is still out with Andrew being incredibly lovey dovey still, I break. I cut him from my social media as well because I couldn't stand to continue reading about how great they still seem to have it. It almost seemed as if Andrew has already moved on, even though he may not. I won't be able to know though because I have blocked him and am still intent on keeping it that way.

---

I'm going to stop there and finally ask for advice. I'm sorry for how long this is, it was much longer than I expected it to be, but I guess there is a lot to cover over a three year friendship. 

---

So this is my problem, after a week of not talking to Andrew, I realized I have invested so much into him that he was the only person I relied on for support. Now I feel as if I have no one to turn to (partly why I'm posting) for love or support. On top of that I am leaving for a prolonged period of time to focus solely on my job. I don't know if this was the right thing to do. I want to go back so badly sometimes and take everything bad but I'm mixed with jealousy, anger, and shame. 

---

I'm trying so hard to take a positive outlook on things. I'm convincing myself that I will have time away to focus on myself and learn what I want, or at the very least build a new support network from the bottom up. But every night I still go to bed thinking about him and Ian. And now I'm hear writing this.

---

Did I make the right decision cutting him completely off? Should I continue to give a cold shoulder to Andrew if he attempts to make contact again? But most importantly, how the hell do I move on from my first serious relationship when I'll be spending months away from everything focusing only on my job? I don't want to go down there and become filled with regret. And honestly, I don't trust myself with my weapon...

Thanks for sticking with me if you read all the way through. I feel like a horrible mess right now and have gone through six cigarettes just typing this all out.

**TL;DR**: I've cut off all contact for the first time of a man who was my mentor, friend, and brief partner from high school to my military career (3 years) when he took a very tough love approach to my developing alcoholism and seemingly nonchalant attitude of moving on and being lovey dovey with another, better man already before I left, when I visited, and still now afterwards(including tonight, which led to this post.) 

I realized I developed a very obsessive and clingy attitude for him and feel lost and hopeless without him even though I felt this was the right decision after all of our issues. But now I am deploying overseas for months without a solid support network and feel looming suicidal thoughts returning, I don't trust myself with my weapon. What can I do to move on? Was I right to cut him and his new psuedo-partner completely off? Should I try contacting him again and apologize?

I was still upset so i went to hang out with her best friends boyfriend and her best friend. She left her phone in the car and it rang.

12273,Breakups,1jtor8,"Double negative was intentional. I can't stop being friends with my ex, despite it killing me slowly.

I first met her 3 years ago via a mutual friend during a fourth of July get together. We quickly became friends and within 4 months we were an official couple. 

Things are going great. Best relationship I've had, hands down. But fast forward to a little over a year into our relationship to November 2011, and I end things. Basically I was having weird feelings about our future, as well as an old ex. Those issues coupled with the fact that she was leaving to study abroad in Holland for 6 months just threw me through a loop. I honestly thought the best thing for us would to not be together while she was away. But really I was just being selfish. Let's face it, long distance sucks. 

Unfortunately I can't take my own advice and probably try a bit too much to stay in contact with her. She has told me that it made her feel stifled and constricted, which I fully understand. I regret so much about how I handled her leaving. Everything I did was basically the worst thing I could have done, if that makes sense. It broke a lot of things.

Then she came back in July of last year, she felt more distant than she was when she was halfway around the world. Over the course of the year, I've kind of stuck around and kind of waited for her to get her shit together. It's been the most draining ordeal I think I've been through. Emotionally draining. My pride doesn't like admitting this, but it's affected much of my life. I'm not as happy as I should be.

But on the other hand, we have come a long ways since a year ago. We are actually decent friends somehow. I've worked sooo hard to get to where I'm at with her, and it makes it that much harder to not be friends with her. Like I don't want this entire year of struggles to be for nothing. I don't know what to do. I do care about this girl immensely. I kick myself in the ass over and over when I think about the reasons I broke up with her. They could have been worked through together, and I'm so sorry for myself that I didn't work through things with HER. We work well together when we are working together. I don't know why I thought it was best to just stop everything before she left. I don't understand my thought process regarding that anymore.

So now I'm here. I just had a talk with her and she told me that she doesn't want to date. She can only do casual things at the moment. She said she considered trying to start something casual with me, but realized that she can't. That with me, it's going to be full commitment or nothing at all. And she is going to grad school eventually at some distant university, so I think that's something that is always in the back of our minds. The problem stems from mostly being at completely different stages in our lives. She's in full college mode. She told me explicitly that she doesn't want to answer to anyone, have minimal responsibilities, and be able to do what she wants, when she wants it. I, on the other hand, have a full time job, a house, car, etc. I find it increasingly difficult to relate to that mindset anymore. She flip flops back and forth with her feelings about me, she said. But she is in the same boat as me. She wants a friendship with me and doesn't know how to not have that.

So what do I do here? It's not like I can just do no contact. If this was a fresher break, then yes. But it's been horrendously long and drawn out. I'm frequently sad, and it seems like not many things outside of a text or hearing from her can make me happy. I want these feelings to die. I want and deserve happiness by now, and I usually don't consider myself entitled to anything.

12275,Relationships,2m02sv,"I first met this girl at church camp. Between this time we had 2 off and on little spurts of affection. The first time, she had dated a guy for a long time, broke up with him liked me, i messed it up. I told everyone I was dating her and I wasn't. Very immature and stupid. Second time, I gave it time, and she liked me again. (I know this because someone told me a few months after that she picked me over another guy) AGAIN, I messed it up. So I have given it some more time to heal and we are both 18, senior year, and I see her at church only every Sunday. I have liked this girl for 3 years. I am only 18 and know there is more to discover, but I have yet to meet a girl as beautiful as her. She is very kind to me, and I talked to her this past Sunday. The only thing is, there are a lot of girls (or a few) that like me. I just don't like them. I do my best not to compare them to my crush, and I usually don't, but I still can't find anything long-term wise I like. I feel like I see her everywhere. In other girls, not in just looks, but personality, smile, kindness, etc. I guess you could consider me obsessed, and a few other things. But i have gone away from the creepy, weird, and stalkerish things. I have grown mature and realized my mistake. I can talk to her, but it is hard at times. In reality it shouldn't be, because she is always kind and willing to talk to me and even says hi to me first. So I guess I am just saying, what is your opinion on what should I do? Should I try to build a relationship one last time, and ask her out? Should I just be her friend and move on? Before i would get mad if someone even mentioned moving on, but now I realize that there are other girls out there. As of right now, however, there is no girl that even comes close into comparison with my crush. And no, I haven't secretly stalked in her and taken pictures in the background I have talked to her about dreams, hung out with her on multiple church occasions in a group, etc. I haven't been on a date with her though. I have asked this question to many, and seem haven't to got an answer. I don't want her to be in the way of a girl that might be right in front of me, but I don't want to miss the opportunity if it can work out. :) 
Also, she just started coming back around because she had been busy with volleyball and other things, so I am able to see her more often.

She is amazing, mature, smart, sexy, beautiful girl. I give her everything I can, but because I don't have high income (We both serve in the IDF, at the same base, and we get home each day. She lives at her parents' house, 35 minutes drive from my parents' place, where I live, the IDF gives us less then 130 dollars. A month). She works a lot, I don't have a job. Her job at the army is much easier then mine, I work harder and longer hours, but since she has a job outside the service time, she makes 500 extra dollars a month.

So I feel I'm in her way. She wants to move out. Because of financial reasons, it's far from possible (it will get us deep in debt), although I did try very hard to find a solution. I feel badly for it. She loves me a lot, but I think she may feel resentment towards me.
Second reason is I don't find a job, knowing full well we may not be able to meet almost at all if we both have a job... So i'm think i'm waiting for her to finish her active service (I have a year and 5 month to go. She has a bot less the 4 month, but i'm not sure about it.
Lastly, After she will finish her two year duty (females soldiers have to serve two years, male soldiers have to serve three) she will probably want to continue with her life, and I will be stuck behind... And it sucks.

12279,Relationships,28qc9p,"Hello guys,

I've been friends with a girl I met at school for about 2 years now. In those 2 years, we've become really really close in terms of friends, to the point where we treat each other as brother and sister (we've even called each other that for jokes). We would be able to talk openly to each other about absolutely anything whether it be everyday work problems, people problems, anything at all. Just recently though, the both of us have been talking a lot about our past relationships (we both have had friends with benefits before), sex, what turns us on, and the like. In the past few days, we would text each other non stop for hours on end about such topics. She often talks about how she misses that type of casual relationship and how it would be really difficult to find a new one. Coincidentally, I am also in the exact same boat and have told her how it's funny that we both just happen to want the exact same thing.

Honestly, I would love to take her on as a friend with benefits (FWB). We know each other inside out and think almost exactly alike in what we want out of a FWB relationship. It feels like every conversation we have about it is her asking for it but the only problem is that because we're so close, I'm afraid of it somehow not working and resulting in hurting our relationship and making it awkward between the two of us. She told me that in the past she rejected a guy friend who asked her for a FWB relationship just because she was afraid it wouldn't work out and make their relationship permanently awkward.

Right now i'm really confused as to why we even talk about our past FWBs, and how badly we want one now. Is she telling me this because we are extremely close and that it's just part of the brother and sister relationship where we are able to openly talk to each other about anything? Or is she hinting me and implying that she would want such a relationship with me? I'm so confused.

Tomorrow night, I plan on asking her to become my FWB. I don't really know how it's going to turn out but it's the one question that has been stuck in my mind forever. If she says no, i'm afraid it may become really awkward between us. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or if there is a better way at it.

For the past few months I have been picking up my brother [17 M] from school almost everyday. Occasionally, people would ask for rides or my brother would offer rides. There have been few times when a have given a ride to two girls. The first girl I have met in the past in high school, let's call her Jenny. The second girl, let's call her Nicole, and I never met previously and we have not been introduced to each other. Jenny and Nicole are best friends and every time I gave them a ride I always dropped them both off at Jenny's house, as requested.

12284,Infidelity,2oakor,"I was away for work for about a month when this happened about 8 months ago. Just recently I took a new offer for well paying job 2000 miles away from home. She just barely told me about this.

The thing that kills me is she just went to a bar and randomly go home with some guy, then went back the next night to do it again with the same person and then cut off contact with him. She never mentioned anything was wrong and I always felt like we got along very well, we were always goofy and loving. This was all while her parents were watching our 2 year old son. She is telling me she did this because I was ignoring her and was that I was too unhappy and she is addicted to attention... I admit that I was pretty depressed and focused on a job I hated that required going to work at 3AM.  

I also feel I need to mention she was married before me and he cheated on her and it devastated her.  This makes it worse, knowing she did the same thing to me even though she knows what it is like.

She says that she told me because she felt so guilty and had been repenting for so long by not going out anymore. Every time I bring it up to talk about she will get super defensive and angry, but I do admit I am acting quite emotional at times about this which doesn't help. She says she wants to stay together with me forever and it was a mistake.

I just don't know how to feel about this, how can you love someone and do something like that. Now I am stuck far away from my friends and other family in this lease and job. I feel like it was super selfish, she only told me to make herself feel better, and she told me after I took this job and got stuck in position. I have to stay here for at least a year and I feel so alone.

12285,Breakups,1jyp2d,"I've had a very messy breakup with my first boyfriend. We were together for 4 years, all in all. At the 2 year mark I found out that while I thought he was completely sober the entire time, he was drinking a large amount of alcohol every single day for the last year, and I had no idea. He continued to lie to me about it after coming clean, about going to meetings and doctors, and I felt betrayed and broke up with him. 

It didn't stick. I loved him too much to stay away from him, and just kept seeing him and pretending like everything was fine, without agreeing to 'officially' get back together. I was hoping he would just get his life together so I could tell my parents I was seeing him. He kept asking me when we could get back together and I just could never agree to do this. I thought that if we did that we would just continue along a trajectory toward getting married, and I was worried that the future might be bleak with someone with an addiction problem, no bank account, no 'real' job, etc. So I was just waiting, I guess, for a sign that everything would be okay. He kept on promising me he would do better but never did. He was extremely possessive of me and eventually got fed up with me keeping our relationship in 'limbo,' and started seeing someone else. 

I understand why he did this. I was very hurt, but I wasn't committing to him the way he wanted me to, so maybe it was for the best. But I loved him and I really did think we would end up together one day. I was so, so heartbroken, for months. He has kept me on the hook by sending me letters about how he loves me so much more than his new girlfriend, I'm his favorite, he wishes that she would just break up with him, I'm better than her in every way except she treats him better, etc. But when I've asked him to just get back together with me, he always says he doesn't want to hurt her, that it would mess up his social life, etc. I'm fed up. But he's also my only boyfriend and only love and I've been so, so sad. And I've done some terrible things. He has cheated on her with me 3 times at this point. We spend the night and he tells me he loves me the most and blah blah blah. It's awful. I regret doing it. I feel like such a terrible person. He initiated it and I just wanted to feel wanted. But I feel very guilty and I am done. I cannot be a part of this anymore. He still sexts me all the time but it has to be over. I don't like feeling like such a jerk. 

I really want to tell her. I keep thinking that if I were in her situation, I would want to know. I am hesitating because I don't know if it's really a good idea to get involved in this way. But she's not going to find out any other way -- he is an amazing liar and deletes all of his contact with me. I'm also scared about how he'll retaliate. But honestly, I just want her to know what is going on. Maybe she and I could be friends one day if she forgives me for all of this (maybe a stupid dream, but I wish it could come true.) He is just so charming that I was sucked in by him for so long, and I know I wish someone would've warned me about him when I could've gotten out of this situation. She might think I am doing this because I want him back, but I have absolutely no desire to have him back anymore. I just hate that she doesn't know what kind of a person he really is. All I would have to do is forward her one of the letters he's sent to me. But I don't know if I'm just feeling like this because I am in the 'anger' phase of the breakup and it's actually a really terrible idea.

It begins with us meeting over plenty of fish, an online dating site. I do not seriously consider using it in any capacity and use it to kill time chatting with locals and people from other countries. I visit the Philippine section of the site and for some reason she catches my eye. We eventually chat and can't seem to stop chatting, we chat many hours a day.

Fast forward a couple of months and we're really falling for each other but I discover something. It shows that she is in a relationship with someone on another Facebook profile. Her with a child and a man. I take screenshots and ask her about this, she denies until the evidence is irrefutable than proceeds to tell me the store. Apparently her boyfriend cheated on her when she was overseas working and took her daughter from her.

Fair enough, I feel sympathy for her and let it go. Months pass and I go to the Philippines for 20 days in December and January, after 3 months of knowing her. We have intercourse and I feel very much in love with her. Things go extremely well and we seem very happy.

I return to Canada with the promise I will visit again in the summer. She plans on working in Hong Kong. Things do not go so well when I am there and she acts moody. Eventually we get in a bad fight when I am having my mid term university exams and she blocks me on facebook for 8 hours when I sleep, saying maybe we should not talk for a while, or forever!!!!. This is extremely stressful.

The next day she unblocks me and I am very mad but concerned about preserving the relationship. We seem to make up even though I am furious. Something is still happening though because I am noticing the number of contacts on her Skype list go up and up. 

Spurred by this curiosity I begin searching every dating site I can find. Sure enough, as recent as a couple of days ago I found her on a fully active dating site, where she was actively using it with pictures taken during out time together.

Again she attempts to deny her behavior and is again confronted by evidence, she then admits it and said it was because of her pride and anger after our fight. I force her to delete all her Skype contacts and the dating site, and tell her that she has one last chance with me.

Getting used to this pattern, I begin to notice that she now has to sign into skype, whereas before she would be away 100% of the time. Assuming correctly that she had another skype account, I looked up by email and yes, she has made another recent Skype account, presumably to chat with the people she met on the dating site.

Is there any room for reasonable doubt or alternative explanations at this point?

12287,Relationships,1nno2x,"I've been dating a girl for more than a year now, and recently, we seemed to have brought up issues regarding one another, and talked about it through texts, and also meeting up to talk about it. It seems that some of which are what some of her needs, but I seem to be unable to express my emotions any properly (I'm an INTJ and she's ESFP, if that helps). We are both having disagreements, and refuse to step into a relationship with us having some problems, mostly regarding me. However, we both like each other, and are already starting to feel attached to each other even though we decided not to step into a relationship before we solved these problems. Currently, she is unsure as to whether to continue this or not.

Here are some of the problems:

1. She is unable to feel any emotion from me. Be it whether I text, or talk to her in real life, she felt that she is unable to feel any emotion and she found it hard to figure out what I was feeling. I've been trying to fix that for a long time now, but I seem to be unable to fix it alone, therefore coming here for help.

2. She felt that whenever we were going out, it felt as though we were just close friends instead of dating. She mentioned that it might be because we felt too comfortable with each other. In which, we could be who we are whenever we are together such as talking about nonsensical stuff and such.

3. She has dated quite a number of guys before me, even though she felt nothing for them. However, she said that when she was dating me, she had feelings for me, but she couldn't feel anything from me, despite me trying really hard to constantly reassure her that I still had feelings for her.

4. She doesn't feel loved, and so far, none of us actually stepped outside of our comfort zones to actually buy each other gifts, hold hands or anything like that. It isn't much of our culture to actually do these when it is still on early stages of the relationship, but I have no clue as to how exactly I should do it.

5. She felt as though we were very different people. However, I do want to continue this relationship with her, because I feel that even though we might be different, we will be able to cover each other flaws and such, so to me it was a good thing even though it take awhile to overcome this obstacle. But it seems as though it has given her the negative impression that us being different might lead to quarrels and all.

I guess that is about it. She is also mostly unsure what she wants to express to me, I find it difficult to express my affection to her and also my emotions. She said she was only rarely be able to sense my emotions through texts and when I am talking to her, but other than that, she felt that I was mostly not showing anything.

Please help me with my problems, I am trying to better myself for her, and I really do not wish to lose her because I feel that I am quite attached to her already (I know this was a mistake to feel such a way before getting into a relationship), and I am willing to change myself for the better so that I can provide her for her needs in order for everything to be fair to her.

But mostly, I feel that I am unable to show any or do anything for her might be because I don't exactly know how to. For all my life, I've been living in such a logical life, and I want to get out of this trap as well. For example, whenever we go out, I will be kinda wishy-washy as to where to go until she suggests somewhere to go.

12289,Dating,3hnfm1,"I am in grad school, in my second to last year. Working in an office that's off campus for the rest of the summer. Started a particular assignment last week, and there's a student a year ahead of me who is working there too, until the end of next week. From day one we hit it off immediately! Talking all day, making jokes, laughing, having a great time. I mean, you know when you really hit it off with someone in that way, and they're stealing glances every chance they get, and then you are too, and you just feel kind of giddy every time you see them? Yeah, that's how it's been. We've been pretty inseparable the days we've worked together, going to get lunch just the two of us, etc etc. You get the picture. It's only been a week but I feel like that's all you need to get a sense that you're interested in someone. 


So today was my last weekday on this particular assignment. He was working somewhere else today so I didn't see him. I was telling myself that I was going to ask him out after my last day, like Hey, so it's my last day and I guess I'm not gonna see you anymore... bummer! Wanna grab a drink sometime outside of work? sort of thing. But then I didn't see him today so I didn't get the chance. I sent him a short and (in my mind) witty little email this afternoon basically saying how bored I was at the office today, and he responded a little while later asking for me to let me know what day I'm going in this weekend (I have to pick one weekend day here to work by the end of the month, and so does he) and that maybe he would join me for it. 


So... right now I don't know how to respond. I'm sort of dying to say well if we don't see each other this weekend can we hangout sometime anyway, but I just don't know if that's a good idea. What if he rejects me and I have to see him around? Another thing is, he graduates May of next year and is possibly/probably moving away, so is there even a point (I know, I know, getting ahead of myself, but I do that sometimes). His actions have been incredibly flirty in my opinion, but maybe that's just his personality, and he would be like that with any girl. What do I know.


It is definitely not hard for me to find a date or attract guys in general, but I rarely really put myself out there because it hasn't gone incredibly well in the past on the few occasions I have done it, and I'm always scared that I'm just reading the situation wrong. Plus this is sort of a work/professional environment and even though we won't be working too closely together in the immediate future there's still some possibility of it or bumping into each other in another capacity. 


I suck at having crushes. How should I reply to his email? Should I stick my neck out there at the risk of being embarrassed? Should I wait to ask him out in person even though I don't know if or when the next time I'll see him in person will be? Help!

12290,Relationships,30upsv,"I was at work and had a phone conversation with my wife a few moments ago. I first asked her how she feels today, if she's feeling sick (due to a relatively new health issue), and if she ate anything today. After her answers to these questions (which I think are caring questions, but in her opinion, a valid one, they are questions anyone can ask, so are they truly considerate ones?) I asked her if she was feeling well enough to go out tonight to run some errands with me and I also mentioned if we could do some housework at home.

The issue is that because I asked her if she was feeling well enough *to do x outside* it negates the fact that I asked if she was feeling well. It makes it seem as if I only care about doing X. And then I explain that I say we need to do X because we have a lot of things to do, and she always told me I need to be a person who leads in the house (and I understand, if I don't set an example in doing things, then nothing will get done).  But then because I'm talking about going to do X, it's not that I really care about doing X for us (like as in accomplishing goals), but that I care about *the fact that I said that we need to do x* so that I look good and responsible. She said I sound like a defensive talker, like someone who is passive or passive aggressive. I'm confused by this.

That pissed her off, because it makes me sound like I'm really selfish, and I'm not putting myself in her shoes. Not only that, but in a way, she's right, because I started focusing on how I needed to get back to work and didn't want to have a really long conversation (20+) on my phone at work.

Basically, 75% of our conversations end up like this and I'm really confused about how to express my caring for us and our goals, short-term and long-term. And I'm really not sure what empathy is, because apparently I don't know how to do it or ask how she really feels.

 Girlfriend upset, seemingly due to masturbation habits and keeps sexualizing everything we talk about. Is it due to possible underlying problems or is she being irrational? Is there a way I can explain to her that masturbation isnt evil and that guys dont just masturbate due to uncontrollable sexual urges? Im really lost here :(



Hi folks, throwaway incase anyone recognized my main account. Sorry for the sort of longish post.

So my girlfriend who I love very much has had a habit of sexualizing a lot of stuff we talk about. For instance, I had a particular anime/manga I LOVED and set my computer wallpaper as the characters. She saw it and immediately was like OMG SHE HAS HUGE BOOBS I see why you like it so much now. 

We play league of legends together and every time I play a female champion she would say something like you think shes hot? you like her because her boobs are huge huh! 

Earlier today (like 20 minutes before writing this) she was grumpy because she was tired and I was trying to get her to sleep (partly because I knew when she was tired she was extremely prone to think about things that piss her off and try to bring them up, which often leads to fights) but she wouldn't give up bringing stuff up. 

It really got bad when she said something along the lines of I always wonder why you never agree with me when I find someone attractive or mention someone's attractive. Now I should mention if it was guys she was looking at I would have no problem as I wouldnt get jealous about that. It bothers me because she always brings up girls, usually half naked or wearing skimpy clothes. you get the idea. 

The way I responded was something along the lines of 

i feel like you sexualize everything. I used to say yea shes hot or shes cute etc (because I didnt think she was insecure and would get jealous or anything)  but you sexualized it so much it made me uncomfortable. you would get so aggressive and I told you it really made me uncomfortable but you never stopped. you just continued so now I just nod or say yes babe sure because I would prefer to stay away from those uncomfortable situations.

**just a side note about how she began to sexualize it. She would get aggressive and go like YEA? you wanna do her? look at those boobs damn shes hot id tap that ;] i bet you wish you had her. etc etc stuff like that. 

I would always respond with why would I want some photoshopped person who I dont know when I have a beautiful, hot girlfriend who I love? and she would continue on with her stuff or rarely, stop. 

**end side note

she responded with you have a boner every single day and masturbate almost daily. I had no idea how to respond. I told her that most guys get boners every day. That guys can get them for random reasons or for no reason at all. That we get them when we wake up for no reason (which she has noted and I've mentioned that morning wood isnt sexual) and not all boners are because we see porn or something naked. I told her that masturbation has been shown to relieve stress and calm the mind. That guys even do it simply because theyre bored, not because theyre horn dogs.

She kept on by saying how I'm constantly looking at porn, which i had to say is untrue. I have porn subreddits subbed but I generally scroll past unless im looking to masturbate. Shes the one that looks at them more than me; everytime she uses my computer or phone she would go on reddit and only open the porn links. 

She seems to think I masturbate daily, which is honestly untrue, although i see no problem with it. she continued on to say i atleast see nudity every day, which i cannot deny as even on nonporn subs there is nudity. Although, I neglected to bring up the fact that she is constantly on tumblr and her feed is filled with gifs of porn. I have brought it up in the past and she swore is was different from reddit because im horny all the time and she isnt.

I kept saying that I dont watch porn daily, and I dont think about it all the time. I have a lot of other things to do and she seems to ignore that. she then called me a horn dog and said all I think about is sex. 

**another side note

When together, i wouldnt say we have sex a lot but it does happen. Half the time or more it is her initiating. I would be sitting at my computer or doing something and she would just start stroking me and grinding on my lap and I would be like what are you doing? im doing something and she would be unrelentless. She always points out how horny I am and I am always like you seem pretty horny too you are always rubbing on me, but everytime i bring this up she says things like Im not horny... fine im never doing those things again. Cause im not horny its you that always has a boner. I really am not sure how i was supposed to respond in situations like these, but back on point

**end side note 

I went on to repeat myself and say a boner doesnt necessarily mean horny. I said guys get boners for no reason sometimes, or for weird reasons. 

It was at this point in the conversation that I realized it was pointless to keep arguing about it, said goodnight, and stopped answering her messages. 

I dont masturbate daily. there are times when i can do it two or three days in a row but sometimes I just dont feel like it. She keeps making me out to be a huge pervert and horn dog and I dont know what to do (a lot of the time on skype, she even starts flashing me and showing stuff yet she still calls me the pervert and horn dog). Back when she wasnt as busy with school/work she would masturbate every single night. She is acting like it never happened.

Reddit, I need advice. I have no idea what to say. Ive tried to explain masturbation isnt solely sexual it can be for stress relief or boredem. What could be causing this. could it be insecurity (i know she has had problems with it). What can I say to make her feel better about it? To get her to see my point of view (something that really isnt that easy with her).

We're both pretty nerdy and share a lot of nerdy hobbies together (game of thrones, star craft, star trek) however one area where we never bonded was his love of anime. I tried numerous times but could never get into it. He says his to favourite animes are Naruto and Attack on Titan. He occasionally will do marathons of anime and i won't hear from him for a few days.

Today he asked me to take a picture of him with his phone while he was posing and the background was the blind girl from Naruto (usually he has an anime background picture). Now I take a bunch of pics and one came out super bad so I go into gallery to delete it but when I do I see a folder called Best and the thumbnail is a naked drawing of the blind girl from naruto. I click on it and it's literally just hundreds of pics of her all the same character. I am in shock.

It hits me that he never made me his phone background it's always the blind girl from Naruto. I don't want him to think I was creeping so I don't say anything but he can tell somethings off. I tell him i'm just feeling a bit sick and he drives me home and we kiss goodbye.

Now I know porn is pretty common for guys even though I told him that I won't have sex before marriage I let him no porn is still okay with me for him to watch. But I never heard of cartoon/anime porn to this degree. I don't think there was any human porn in his phone. We're both virgins and I don't really talk about sex with other people so is it common because it seems a bit weird. The other thing that gets me is it's all the same girl and he never has me as his background image but it's her instead.

For the past few months, however, I realized why I loved this girl so much and began being the man she desired, showing her more love and affection outside of the bedroom and in other small ways.  Early in our relationship, we moved to a new state together without knowing anyone but each other and started our life here.  I expressed how I felt and gave her time to think about it.

On the day we planned to talk, I was at home waiting for her get off work.  That day before she came home, I found out through an anonymous acquaintance of hers that for nearly the last year of our relationship, she had been cheating on me on a regular basis with another guy who knew she was dating me.  Their affair continued after we broke up, the last time being a week ago right before I told her how I felt.  She always told me I was jealous, so I made it a point in our relationship to trust her.  I loved her so deeply that I would laugh in your face if you had told me she ever cheated on me, let alone for nearly the last year of our relationship.  

I broke down and sobbed for hours.  She came home, and I decided to wait to confront her until I heard what she had to say concerning us.  She noticed the changes over the past few months and, while she said she’d want to think about it more, she ultimately favored the idea of getting back together.  I asked if she had ever been unfaithful in our relationship, or even after we broke up.  She said no.

I then told her I knew everything.  I knew about the two guys she slept with after breaking up, and I knew that she had been cheating on me with one of them when we were still in a relationship.  She lied again, saying it was only during the last three months of our relationship, but then was honest and said it was for the last year of it.  She was in shock at first as I cried and told her how broken I was, how betrayed I felt.  Soon, she broke down and said she couldn’t ask for my forgiveness because she didn't deserve it.  She said she wanted to end the cheating, but wasn’t strong enough.  She said I wasn’t showing her the physical affection she desired, so she went to someone else for that.  She said she hated herself, but she wouldn’t break things off with me because she knew I was perfect for her.

I wanted to kick her out, to throw her stuff out of the apartment, to change the lock and never speak to her again.  But I love her more than life itself.  And while she betrayed me and hid it from me for so long, I know she loved me.  We cried together, and talked through the next day.  She wants to get back together.  She sent the guy a message explaining everything, erased all contact he ever sent her, and told him he could never talk to or see her again.  She told me she wants to be completely transparent, to show me she can change and not hide anything form me (texts, calls, where she is, etc.).

I have never felt so betrayed, and yet I still love this girl more than anything.  Am I a fool for considering this?  Should I cut all ties, accept the heartache, and try to move on?  Or should I give her another chance and try to rebuild our relationship?  Knowing Reddit the way I do, I know most of the advice that will follow.  But I would also like to hear from people who have been cheated on and gave it a second chance.

TL;DR: Knew the most amazing girl for eight years, dated for three, and mutually broke up last winter.  She continued to live with me and we kept up a physical relationship.  Fell in love all over again and decided she was “the one.”  Then found out she cheated on me for nearly the last year of our relationship with another guy.  She broke down and immediately cut all ties with this guy, told me she wants to be with me, and she will be transparent and earn my trust again.  The love of my life cheated on me.  What should I do?

We have sex regularly, but I never feel like he is trying to please me. Many times I'm still dry when we start having sex. When I ask him to do things for me or when I tell him I want him to try to make me orgasm, he says he can't because I've never masturbated. 

  In other relationships I think I've come close to orgasm before so it's not like I have no idea what makes me feel good, I've just never really wanted to masturbate. I've told him to try these things but most of the time, he refuses to try or doesn't put much effort in  to please me because I don't want to masturbate, even though I often do things to please him.

12295,Relationships,3g9vgn,"First off, I live in Colombia, but I'm not Colombian.  I've been living here for a couple of years and have been dating my girlfriend, Jenny, for about a year and a half.  Despite some enormous cultural differences at times, we normally are the envy of all other couples and love each other.

However, let's say I go out drinking with friends and I don't call Jenny until I get home (pretty late), she is FURIOUS.  Now the context is a little special, as the city I live in is quite dangerous and there are occasional kidnappings and the homicide rate is pretty high.  The problem is that she will use my mistake in not calling her and accuse me of lying to her about other things.

For example, today she apparently sent me a text asking me to go to the store her family runs so that she could bring me home after work.  I never got the text.  She claims that I'm lying and that I obviously ignored her the whole day, because I ignored her when I was drinking with my friends the other day.  I showed her a screencap of my text log and proved to her that I hadn't ignored her.  She was still incredibly angry and insisted that I had ignored her.

I brought up how there would be no point in my lying about it, as I would have loved to receive the favour she had offered, and she seemed to believe me, but her pride won't let her back down.  So she is being very sarcastic with me and I don't appreciate it.  It almost seems like my girlfriend did a 180 degree turn and is a different person - she is normally NEVER like this.

My question, out of pure desperation, is what the hell can I do to bring reason to this equation?  Are relationships like this just doomed?  Is this going to happen forever?

12297,Relationships,370vuy,"EDIT: Guys! I typed this on my phone and I made a typo - I'm 24 years old, not 22! Sorry about that. 

Hello, 

So I've been with my girlfriend for six months now, and though the repercussions of my problem have mainly been affecting that relationship, my relationship with good friends and even my parents has taken a blow as well. I'm becoming more withdrawn and antisocial and have found myself bailing out on more social events and becoming more of a recluse as time goes on, and I want to change but I'm having some huge trust issues.

It started after I watched the film Whiplash. I've been a huge fan of Miles Teller ever since I saw him in Project X and it was only strengthened when I saw him in 21 &amp; Over, and I thought I had a firm grasp of what he was like. He was the typical popular guy - an awesome, funny, jovial &amp; confident guy with a distinct sense of humor that reflected this. Just the kind of guy that everyone likes and everyone wants to be around.

Even though he didn't have a huge role in Project X, the scene he did have and his facial expressions and everything illustrated the kind of guy he was - the archetypal cool, popular guy. The kind of guy who wouldn't let his popularity go to his head and be a jerk to people, but the kind of guy who's awesome to everyone. He seemed the same in 21 &amp; Over, which I loved, and showed the exact same characteristics even more so and I thought I knew the guy.

Now I watch Whiplash and I'm shocked! He's almost the opposite of the Miles Teller I know. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I understand he's acting but I'm struggling to find which role is the real Miles Teller &amp; which one he's had to take on a totally different persona for. Needless of the outcome, I'm struggling to think of him as a legitimate person anymore. It's not like other actors where you can tell that they've drawn upon their character for some roles but not for others - this is like he's two totally different people, and I feel like he's reeled me in and deceived me. I know it's illogical but I can't help but feel personally wronged on some level.

After this, I've found myself becoming more and more reticent and left wondering who's going to change next and who I can really trust, if anybody at all. It's starting to severely strain my relationships and I need to stop this change but I don't know how. Can anyone offer any advice at all?

12300,Relationships,39ftyf,"EDIT: Way to many people are misunderstanding this and trying to have arguments about whether ADHD is real. I know that it is a real condition. My family has a history of ADHD. Both my younger brother were diagnosed with it. 

In my case my girlfriend does not. Has said she does not. She simply got the prescription to help her do work she does not like for a company she does not like. 

My girlfriend(25) and I(25) have been dating for about 10 months now. We are absolutely in love with each other and spend as much time as we can together. She was not on adderall when we started dating but told me she took it every day for about 2 years up until 2013.

Around 3 months ago she expressed interest in getting back on it due to lack of organization and enthusiasm towards her job. I told her that I thought that those weren't good reasons to start taking adderall again but I would support her no matter what she decided to do. I also expressed the concern that it would change her. She went ahead and went to her psychologist and got the script again no problem. Once she had the perscription she began taking it M-F with weekends off. 

Fast forward to yesterday, she took a personal day to work on a certification and stayed home for the day. I get to her place after work( 5:30ish) and she's clearly tweaked out on adderall. Barely says hi. Keeps working in complete silence for about an hour and a half(7:00) and only stops when I ask her to. 

This really hits hard with me and my mind takes over. I start to notice how much weight she has lost recently(15lbs). How restless her sleep has been. Some nights she hasn't been sleeping at all. How low her libido has been. I can't help but begin to think How is this beginning to affect her thoughts toward me and us. I start to think about how much I don't like this person I'm around right now. Cold, detached, clearly unable to turn it off and thinking about the work that could be done.

I know how adderall works and what it does to your brain. I've taken it a handful of times and know how great it can make everything. But I have no idea what it's like to take it 5 days in a row week after week after week. I'm afraid that things are going to stop feeling as special between us because the adderall is making everything too awesome. 

I'm fine with every once in a while to get shit done but even once a week seems to much like dependence to me. I'm not ok with where this has gone and afraid that she has become dependent on it. She's aware of the physical effects(weight loss, insomnia) and has commented on them before. What worries me most is I don't think she understands what's going on in her brain chemical wise when she takes this stuff and the lasting effects from it. 

In all honesty I'd like to her to stop completely but I know I can't tell her what to do. I just want to know the best way to present my case that she's hurting herself more than she knows and that could turn into hurting our relationship.

TL;DR: Girlfriend started taking adderall that she deosn't need and its effects are beginning to show and I'm afraid of what it will do to our relationship. How do I get her to stop taking it?

Not sure sure if there is any real answer to this or if I just needed to type it all out. Anyway, thanks for listening.

We where together for little over a month but I have been friends with her since 3th gread. After hight school we lost touch and she just got ahold of my a few months ago. I had a crush on her in high school but never had then nor to tell her and to find out she did as well. 
   I asked her out on a date that went well by that night we both knew we wanted a serious relationship. We really feel hard in love fast but everything felt so right. She would tell me that she never wants to leave my side and one day have kids and be together for ever. I agreed with her I known her for so long and my feelings are strong I agreed with her. So last weekend we stayed at her place and we had a blast going to the fair and her aunts birthday. Sunday night I had to go to work out of town and she's fine with my long distances job. 
  Well this is where things get weird. She was going to show up at my hotel and stay with me their but she couldn't get her car fixed in time. I kept telling her that I miss her and wish she would have made it to my hotel for the week. I think I made her feel bad by telling her that. I was at work when I received a text from her say that things have been going to fast it's scaring her and she doesn't want to be in a relationship because the last guy she was with was 9 moths ago with her fiance of 4 years. I called he asking what was going on and she said it was over that she isn't ready she is still very much in love with her ex even though the ex now has a baby on the way with is new girlfriend. So she knows she can't get back with him. I told her I can help her work through it. She end up telling me that she feels like she is cheating on me when she thinks of him so no she wouldn't want to do that. She said when she is ready getting her life together she would come back to me and  on how much of a good boyfriend I was to her and how much she loved me. Then I asked if we could be friends and she really didn't want to becuse she knows she broke my heat. The next day I talked to her and she was very dry and mean like we never shared anything special together. She also to me she thought about it all that day and talked to her mom about us. Her family loves me from what I know. 
  I'm just so lost on how you can love someone and minutes later their done with you no friends or relationship. I try talking to her about it and said she regrets it but sticking with her decision. I just wish things didn't go this way it did I miss her and want to be with her. I'm just really lost and don't know what to do?

Between my two jobs and four classes I have had very little time to put effort into our relationship. 
That being said he is the most important aspect of my life, we've lived together now for just over a year (was a very sudden decision and I'm so happy it's one we made together because I love living with my best friend :)) and I try my hardest to continue to put effort into it. 

But I've been internalizing a lot of stuff lately and at this point I think I'm just becoming toxic to him.

I openly admitted to him last night that I'm interested in seeking professional help (which really scares me).

12307,Dating,2aukbs,"so i work with this guy, we have probably known each other for three years now. the whole time i've known him i have been in a relationship and when he first started he was in a relationship that ended with his girlfriend cheating on him, which i'm pretty sure caused him to have trust issues. he is an attractive guy and i have always got along well with him.


recently i became single and knew he might be interested in me because two months ago after a work party, he texted me, which he never had before, commenting on the fact that my dress was cute. going off this fact alone mostly, i went in to work last week with some other co-workers to have dinner and we talked about going out that night. a little background on this guy is that he very rarely ever goes out with all of us from work. he also never drinks. so my friend calls him over to see if he is interested and he actually is. later at the bar we are all having a good time and we have all had about five or six shots. four of us eventually end up at my house, me and him, and another guy and girl we work with. 


i'm kind of out of it and we are all sitting just watching videos, but notice eventually that he's discreetly rubbing his leg against mine, followed by his hand later on. so i figure now i know for sure. everyone eventually leaves but he ends up texting me that if i want, he can come back. at this point i know that if i say yes, that we will end up having sex because i would not be able to resist initiating at that point. so he comes back and we put on a movie. he has his arm around me and i have my hand on his leg and at a certain point i just know he will never be the one to initiate anything so i go for it. we have sex and it was great. he immediately gave me oral and was just cutesy, kissing me everywhere. it wasn't even awkward, which is what i was worried about. afterwords he took a while to get dressed and even mentioned at one point that he didn't want to go home. eventually he did as the sun was coming up but he gave me an extremely long hug and kiss goodbye.


at this point, i'm kinda freaking out. i'm new to this and have no clue what to do. the next time we see each other is at work a day later. i guess i should mention we work at a restaurant. anyways he is super helpful to me at work, grabbing stuff for my tables when he overhears they need something. work was really busy though so we didn't really talk that much. later on someone was making plans to go out the following night and let people know. at this point he was almost off the clock while i was closing. now he almost never hangs around after he is off, but tonight i notice as i'm approaching the manager with my money, he is helping the bartender put stuff away, off the clock. once i go back to the office, he shows up asking me about what i worked the next day. i said i closed bar and he asked if i was going out, since closing meant i was going to be out late. i said i was and asked him if he was planning on going. he said yes.


so the next night rolls around and i get to the restaurant with a few people. i'm almost convinced he is not going to show because like i said, it is not really his thing. he actually does show up and i can tell really quickly he is not feeling it, as he is not really interacting too much. i feel bad also because my friend points out he only ordered a water, he is here for you. i text him that i know he is not feeling it and i would be down to leave if he wants. he ends up going outside to smoke with the guys, eventually texting me back that we will soon. he ordered a drink at this point and started socializing. it get's to a point where we all say our goodbyes, so i text him that i know he is tired but if he wants to come over he can. he responded that he was already here at my house. 


he comes in and offers to smoke, so we smoke weed. we end up just talking for a few hours. i had recently bought a tv that was still in the box and he offered to set it up for me, which we did. we watch a show on netflix and once it ends he pulls me closer on the couch, and locks my leg in between his, but still once again i just have this gut feeling he will not initiate anything further than that type of contact. i initiate sex again and it's just as great as the first time if not better. he is mostly concerned with getting me off, even saying that he only kept going because he wanted to make sure i was good. we talk a little bit afterwords and it does not seem like he has any intention of leaving, so i start to panic a little bit. i wasn't sure if i should ask him to stay or really what to do at that point, so i just mention that i'm sorry, but i'm really tired. we talk for another 15 minutes and he gives me another long hug and kiss goodbye, and says he will let me get to sleep.


the previous night a friend had invited everyone to his place to swim the next day, which once again the guy said he would come after he knew i was going. that ends up not happening though since it was overcast. i decide to just text him a short hey i had a really good time with you last night before i go to work. he responds that he also had a good time, besides getting no sleep and that he was happy to have the day off to recover. we haven't talked since then.


i just am really new at this. i've only had the one serious relationship and before that i hooked up with a few guys, just oral/fooling around, and i knew those guys were obviously just looking for sex. i'm just not sure with this guy. i know he is a pretty nice guy, so i'm wondering if that is all there is to it, is him just being nice?


i'm not particularly sure if i'm looking to jump back into a relationship now, but i feel there is a possibility i could develop feelings for this guy if i keep hanging out and having sex with him. then there is the fact that the sex is really good and i don't want that to end quite yet. i also feel like maybe i could be reading to much into things, because i tend to over think situations. i know at the end of the day if i want to know his intentions, i just have to ask, but before i even think of doing that, i just wanted to hear any insight from anyone who has been in a similar situation.

We work together and our shifts overlapped by like 40 minutes, she just told me at work on monday that she has a bad day and wants to be alone, doesnt want to talk and also doesn't want me to come over after work which was planned for like 2 days now. 

She did not say anything after that, ignored my phonecall, but our colleagues told me that she behaved normal until the moment I entered the room

The day after, yesterday, the exact same thing happened. Colleagues told me her moot dropped right the moment I came in, I tried to talk to her, explained her that I was in worry that something has happened, but she just said she has a bad time, that just happens sometimes and she want's me to let her alone. I asked her if I did something wrong or her behavior is in anyway linked to something related with me, she said that's not the case, there is nothing wrong with me, it's just her.
She also said she couldnt write with me because she was bussy working, but I knew that she used Whatsapp + Facebook when she was on work, colleagues also said that she wrote with her cousin. Apparently she just didn't want to write with me.

I then called her after I finished working, she took the call, but in the 9  of the call duration, she barely said something. I explained that I am hurt by her behavior and that I can't understand it, but everytime I finished talking and waited for her response, nothing happened. If it weren't for the TV running in the background, I would have thought the call ended every time. I said that I love her and that I miss her, she said she would too, but who behaves like this when he loves and misses someone? The call ended with me saying that I will let her alone if that is what she wishes, wished her a good night and told again her that I love her.

I haven't talked to her since then. Today was her free day from work, tomorrow I will see her again at work for like 15 to 30 Minutes. I honestly have not the slightest idea what I should do or how to behave. Not only that, I start to ask myself if I want to be with a girl who shows such behavior, especially with the phrase This happens sometime, just let me alone. Do I really need a girlfriend that suddenly ignores me out of nothing? I wan't to have a girlfriend who is there for me and who I can be there for. I mean, relationship is about being together and caring for each other, overcoming every problem together, isn't it?

I honestly did NOTHING to upset her, not even the slightest thing comes to my mind, and I thought about it the whole 3 days. I asked our colleagues, I asked my roommate, nobody has a clue about anything. She acts normal to everyone exept me. I just dont know what to do. Do you guys have any advice?

TL;DR: GF ignores me for 3 days now without me doing anything to upset her, she only said that she has a bad time and want's me to leave her alone. She acts normal to everyone else, it's just me. I have no clue what to do and need help.

So in highschool, me and this girl dated for 3 years. Wonderful relationship, lost our virginities to each other, the whole 9 yards. She breaks up with me because we dated for 3 years and she felt that it was too long for how old we were. I didn't quite understand that concept at the time but as I got older I did. We parted ways and ended up hating each other for a while.

Flash forward to a year ago: she's at school and I'm working overnights. She worked a job over night one day a week and I had the kind of job I could do whatever I want, so we would end up video chatting for HOURS on end. This progressed to texting every day, which progressed to texting all day every day, which progressed to talking on the phone for hours, which progressed to her calling me whenever she's in the car or getting ready for bed.

One night she was out drinking with her friends and I told her to come over, not thinking she would. She did. We ended up having sex for a few minutes until she stopped me. This doesn't feel right she said. We slept and she left in the morning and the next day we didn't talk for a few hours until I sent her a text hey we need to talk about what happened last night. We got to talking and she said it was a mistake and all this stuff.

A week later she ends up coming over again. We have sex. Incredible, long, amazing sex. This turns into a weekly thing. Now, she refused (and still refuses) to go on a date with me because according to her, we're not getting back together. I've been the only real boyfriend she has and she says she feels like she might be settling if she just went back to me because of how easy it would be. We have a connection like no other, all we have to do is look at each other and smile. She knows how to calm me down and I know how to calm her down. We make such an awesome team and it was real shitty for a while to feel like all this was for nothing. But as it went on, she opened up more and more and I got more and more hopeful we would be together. I didn't wear condoms, because I felt very safe with her (we agreed that if we were going to do this we'd be the only ones we were having sex with). Boy was I wrong...

She goes to her friends college with her to visit her friends boyfriend. Her friend's boyfriend lives in a house with a bunch of football players, and I later found out she used to hook up with one of them. One night, she fucks him and doesn't tell me. She has sex with me a night after she has sex with him. About a week or two after I randomly asked if she slept with anyone, and I ended up fishing the incident out of her. I didn't get mad, I was more like Oh and had a feeling of depression come over me. She was surprised I wasn't flipping out at her and kicking her to the curb. To be honest, I wanted to scream in her fucking face, but I didn't want to scare her away so for once in my life, I decided to take the high road and forgave her and tried to move past it even though I was completely betrayed (and at one point she got mad at me for not being mad enough. women are crazy.)

A week or two after that she's over again and we're having sex. She was sideways on the bed and I'm doing my thang and her vagina started hurting. We lean on the rougher side of sex, so her vagina hurting after a little bit is nothing out of the ordinary. We looked it up and came to the conclusion that I tore her vagina, and that it would heal itself. I told her to go to the doctor for it, but she was a bit embarrassed and refused. Later in the week it starts to hurt when she pees, then to the point of almost crying every time she had to pee. She finally goes to the doctor...

...she calls me crying. She's crying so hard that she can't even speak. I ask what's wrong? (I thought she was gonna tell me she was pregnant) THEY'RE TESTING ME FOR HERPES and she starts crying even harder and tells me she has to go and hangs up. I was driving and I had to pull over my car because I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. We're texting and she's telling me how sorry she is and how I don't deserve to have this happen to me, and how she wouldn't blame me if I was mad and I never spoke to her again. She told me to flip out on her if I wanted. Again, I kept my cool, even though I wanted to SCREAM IN HER FUCKING FACE, I told her I'm mad, but you're going through enough already. She replied back with a novel of a text message telling me how I'm such a good guy and I treat her so well and that anyone else would have left her over this and that I impressed her with how I handled the situation.

Fast forward 3 months (now): she still won't go on dates with me, but I'm taking this slow with her. She's someone who overthinks everything and I don't wanna pressure her. We still see each other and we still sleep together. We hold hands. I kiss her neck and her ears. We know everything about each other. We spend all of our free time talking to each other but yet, she still won't date me. I feel like this relationship might be in purgatory, but I also don't wanna give her any ultimatums. I feel like I love this girl. Actually I do love this girl. I would die for her. I find her incredibly beautiful and smart and funny. And if I was able to change the way I felt about her, believe me I would.

12311,Relationships,2ozfla,"We have dated for 9 months exclusively. When we first started dating we had a brief issue where she acted really flirty one night with another guy at her friend's party (I was her date). I was confused and embarassed and she apologized and said she was being silly and drank too much. We discussed it and moved on.

Over the past 3 months, she has been very friendly with the man we hired to do renovations. He only comes over on the weekends, and she never sees him when I am not there. I'm always there for any interactions.

She is naturally outgoing. But this just feels weird. At first I didn't think anything of it, but it is just feeling stranger each week. She interrupts his work to tell him jokes. She asks him to take a break and have coffee with us. She asks personal details about his life. She compliments him. She is always telling him details about our lives (unsolicited) and she even (jokingly? who knows) invited him to stay for a dinner party we were having.

I don't know what the hell is going on. I asked her about it a couple of times and she said she's just trying to be friendly and ensure he does a good job, and that they are friends (they are not friends). I asked her if she is attracted to him and she said sure, but she would never act on it. 

I am feeling a little embarassed because I can tell this guy thinks she has the hots for him. His assistant obviously thinks so as well. It is always done right in front of me and I'm not even sure what the hell to think any more.  It isn't like I think they are hooking up at all (I know they are not) but it is more the fact that I feel a bit insulted or something and embarassed in front of him.

12312,Relationships,1uvo7b,"Hello everyone!


(sorry for possible grammar errors as English is not my first language)


I'm writing here because a huge argument yesterday with my GF and I don't know if I went too far with what I said...


Well, I am currently in a long distance relationship that started as a standard one (5 months together, 6 months apart more or less). It has been rough, but here we are. 


Regarding the LDR, as the job she has makes her work during the week and some Saturdays/Sundays depending on the week, I have been the one visiting the previous times (4 times coming to her city). For me it's fine, I don't mind, but as I have to buy plane tickets every time, it is difficult not to consume all of my incomes every month and it's a bit of a sacrifice as I have to cut down other possible expenses (things I would buy for me, going out regularly and so on) to buy those tickets. Apart from that I had to lend her some money (more than 4000€) because of some delays in the payments from her job at the beginning and some other sudden expenses. I had enough money saved, and it is fine, I could do her the favour. I trust her and I am not in a hurry to recover the money.


In order for her to start paying this debt, we agreed to annotate every expense she paid for me. This includes for example when I come to her city, and we go to the market we split the money of the receipts, and so on.


This past weeks we spent traveling around, and the annotation was made by her the full time. I asked her to have it written in my computer as well and not only in her mobile phone, and I saw there were all of her payments (down to even 1 or 2€), whereas she had forgot a couple of the payments I had done during the trip (which were more expensive). So I annotate them and told her, but I felt she was getting angry and I asked her why. She said she wasn't angry, but she claimed that it was funny how I annotated every single expense and that I didn't invite her to anything (which isn't true, though it is true it had been a time since I last did) and that I wasn't considerate enough. There I went mad, and as I was really pissed off, I said I though she didn't think of the effort I was doing for meeting her every time due to the flight costs. She claimed she didn't ask me to do so (which is true, but I was doing it for her and for the relationship anyway) and she brought up nearly every single payment she had done for me from the beginning of the relationship, which really hurt me, for I had also done things for her she didn't consider at the moment.


So the argument turned huge, with tears and such, and in the end as I felt bad for bringing up the plane tickets thing I apologized profusely to her but she was (and she is) still angry at me and I don't know what should i do now...
in the end...one part of me thinks I'm a jerk for bringing up certain things...but I also hated her double standards.
what do you think? am i being super cheap? do you thing I have gone too far with my claims?

12313,Relationships,1zij21,"Actually, I decided to take a break. Years and years of little things built up until I just felt something was off. We were obviously very young when we started dating and a lot has changed since then. On the surface, the relationship has been perfect. She is very thoughtful, loving, and good to me, constantly. Things got hard when college came around and we went to different schools. We'd see each other about once every month and it got really tough.

I wouldn't say that the distance is the sole reason for the break, but it definitely contributed. I just gradually started to feel that we didn't think the same things were important in life. We were both very understanding, of course, but inside, I think we had different opinions. We didn't fight very often, but when we did, we tried to resolve it quicker to get things back to normal.

Compared to most relationship problems, mine seem very minimal. She never cheated, I never cheated, we don't argue, we laugh and have fun, and she is very, very good to me. But something just felt missing, and I still don't know what it is. As part of the break, we haven't been talking for about two weeks. I'm going to call her in a few days with a decision (make up or break up, to state it plainly). A part of me thinks there's no coming back from this break, and that it's time to move on. But it's very, very difficult to break out of complacency and break away from someone I've loved for a very long time.

People tell me to follow my gut, but I never know what part to follow. Sometimes I'm happy with her, and my gut says stay. Other times, I'm upset and my gut says go.

I don't know what to do, or even what questions to ask myself. It's hard not to feel alone. It's especially hard when I know that I'm the one breaking us apart. This relationship has been a major part of my short adult life, and I'm scared to be without it. I'm also scared to hurt her, because she is so nice.

If anyone can sort through this jumbled stream of consciousness and help a guy out, that would be great. 
Thanks.

* Edited to add : Thank you guys for all of your input. You've given me a lot to think about. It's so hard to just toss an almost 3 year investment out. I really wish this hadn't happened. I'm so heartbroken over this. 










 My boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years and I'm his first serious relationship ever. I am 27. He is 31. We are wanting to start a family next year and I encouraged him to go back to school in order to get a better job. I'm currently finishing up my master's. 

  He started going back full time in the spring and met a classmate that he became attracted to. We do not live together, but he spends a lot of time at my place. He would be at my place with me and be complaining about how much of an emotional mess I was to this teenage girl. He'd also tell her that he thought I was better than he deserved, but that I was, essentially, damaged. He told her personal things about my past that he should not have indulged to her. They would talk frequently about their relationships - each complaining about their own partner. He also would tell her how he liked her pictures, but couldn't do it on facebook because I would see and freak out. 


  Everything sort of came to a head when I checked his facebook (bad I know). He told her that he was interested in her and that he was trying to steal her away from her boyfriend - he later said he was joking about this comment. I freaked out and packed his things. This girl was only 17 when they first met and I have a sexual abuse history. I couldn't deal with this. He starts crying and tells me that he didn't realize it had gotten inappropriate until it got to that point and that he loved me and wanted our relationship...yaddayaddayadda. I know that nothing physical happened between them. This girl was not interested in him like that so we decide to move forward. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. He never tried to kiss her or talked about leaving me for her with her. However, he did say to me at one point that being with her wouldn't be the worst idea.  I am his first serious relationship and throughout his life he's always had a very close female friend that he would be infatuated with. I think this was just old behavior for him. 


  However, he had classes with this girl all summer and lied to me about it. I guess he would still work with her in group projects and they sat next to each other in every class. I asked him to move seats, he declined. My summer was horrible and we fought a lot about this. I was hoping for a turn around in the fall, but it's more of the same. He now has 3 classes with this girl and they sit right next to each other in every class. 


  He swears that all romantic notions are gone. He tells me that he has firm boundaries  with this girl and that she is nothing more than a classmate. However, the fact that they still communicate and sit next to each other drives me up a wall. I have asked him for some kind of physical boundary between them, but he refuses. I feel that I need her gone completely from my life so I can work through the lies and hurt from the situation. While he feels that once he became aware of the situation all inappropriate actions on his part ended and that he is aware of them now. 


  Basically this girl is going to be a part of his (thus my) life the next year. I have spoken to her and she is well aware of what has all transpired, but that has not deterred her from seeking him out. I have since (I know) logged into his facebook and their conversations the past few months have been short and school focused. However, they still see each other 4 days a week and I'm hung up on it badly still. 
  I feel disrespected and not heard. I would like to see their relationship end completely, but he feels that she is a useful school resource. We're at a standstill with this issue. I have sought counseling on my own and we are currently in couples therapy due to this, but I feel it's only getting worse. I think we're both at an all or nothing stance right now. I want her gone and he won't do that. Anyone have any advice? How out of line am I?

12315,Breakups,1ouyf5,"My ex, J, and I have known each other for 5 years. We met on a fluke, and found out with both had a lot in common. With both had a son, a month apart in age. Both already divorced at our young ages, both like the same things and had a very similar sense of humor.

We dated for about 6 months the first time. Turned out, he wasn't ready. He cheated on me with his ex-wife during that time. He apologized, and I stayed. He used to yell at me whenever I touched him, make me drive the 40 minutes to see him, then send me home because he wanted to be alone. He was cold and unattentive, hated any sort of affection, but was oddly sex crazed. He broke up with me, and I broke down. I begged him to reconsider, but he did not. I made a complete fool of myself, texting him on what would have been another month under our belt. Begged, pleaded, eventually went NC.

After awhile, we became friends. Then FWB, because I did not want a relationship with him, but I was lonely. He wanted more, but I said no. He tried for the next 3 years to get me back. I continually said no, but we remained best friends.

Then, in January of this year, We were both single, and he said all the right things. I gave in, and we started a relationship. We had a connection that is unlike anything i've ever felt before. He is still nonromantic and unaffectionate, but we laugh so much and the love is so deep. He spent the first 4 months saying how much he wanted to marry me, kept asking me to marry him, kept asking me to have his baby. I would just laugh and say 'One day.'. 

Then we hit a rough patch. All of the sudden, he just put up his walls again and shut me out. I was feeling lonely even when he was around. He wouldn't touch me. He wouldn't be sweet to me. He would basically show up and I would take care of him and my son in the exact same way. I would cook dinner, or go and pick up dinner. Do laundry. Clean up after everyone. Fix his drink, and when it ran out he would just set the glass in front of me, signaling that he needed a refill.

I carried the whole relationship, when he wanted to see me I was there. When he didn't, I waited until he did. When he needed space, I gave it to him. When he didn't, I gave him everything. I paid for all of our dates, anything we wanted to do was on me. I didn't care, though. At least I had him.

Then, He leaves on a Sunday to go back to his house after being with me for the weekend. I had noticed that he seemed sad, but it was normal as he completely struggles with depression, as do I. I recognize this. 

He went out and got drunk on monday, called me on his way home from the bar and everything was fine. Said he missed me and loved me..... then everything changed. 

He started being distant, even more than usual. I know that when he was at home, even before this, he was shutting himself in his room and wouldn't be around anyone, even his dog. He was usually over on Thursday nights. Thursday during the day, he said he didn't want to come over. Then thursday night, we spoke on the phone... he said that he didn't want me not in his life, that he loved me and cared for me, but he didn't know what he wanted right now - that the only thing he knew is that he didn't want me for the rest of his life.

I said I wasn't playing the games anymore. I wasn't taking the hurtful comments and the mean tone that he had been speaking to me the past few days. That I loved him and that I would stand by him during this depressive episode, but i wasn't going to be treated like shit either.

Long story short, after an hour long conversation, he broke up with me. 

I had seen it coming, but I'm still devastated. I don't know what to do. I have been strict, very strict, NC. I don't plan on breaking this, as I know it's best. This pain is so real... this pain is so deep... I don't want to do anything. I don't want to get out of bed. I want to sleep all day. I want to be around people, but I want to be alone and cry. I'm just hurting so bad. I am crushed. He ruined me. I gave everything to the relationship, I carried the entire relationship for the entire year we were together. I should be angry, not sad. I should feel betrayed. I just can't bring myself to do anything but be completely and utterly depressed.

Please help... Just say something...

I spent time thinking about it, and based on some of the things that were said, I think that there are some problems caused by me which created a vicious cycle of us appreciating each other less and less.

Of the possible things that are my fault, I'm currently focused on two of them; marriage, and hygiene.

After a while of being together, we started talking about marriage. I think we both wanted it, but not until after college. But we both graduated and moved in together, but I had cold feet. I felt like something was wrong, and so I would clam up (her words) when marriage got mentioned.

As for hygiene, she mentioned that I don't take care of my beard (I keep a short-length chin strap) as well as I used to. This seems like something I could easily fix. If it's important to her, it should be important to me! Shave more often; done. The thing that really hurt me was that she said she was physically attracted to a guy at work, and they had been flirting. The guy is taken, and she told me that she would never act on it because she still loves me, but it hurt to hear that, especially because our sex life had dwindled to near-nothing.

Our premise for breaking up is that we can't fix our problems. I've decided that I still want to try, especially since we finally talked them out instead of dwelling on the symptoms. She seems hesitant, and now we both have to be at work so we can't really talk for a while.

I really want to make things work. Am I making a mistake, and if not, can you offer some good advice?

12319,Relationships,2l21f7,"Matt (22/M) and I (23/F) met each other almost 2 years ago in a college course. Our first impression of each other wasn't too great, but as the semester progressed, we found ourselves intrigued by one another. At the end of the semester there was a huge group hang out, and we found ourselves attached to one another. 

At the time, I had just recently broken up with my S.O. and Matt was on a break with his S.O. (Karen). First, we found comfort in each other. We talked about what went wrong in our relationships and we commiserated together. However, we quickly learned that we had a lot in common and started hanging out more. Despite him telling me of his promiscuous past and telling me that he had cheated on Karen while they were together, I found myself really attracted to him. One thing led to another and we started sleeping together. We both made it clear that we weren't dating and that we didn't have any expectations. Also well before we slept together, he had told me that by the end of that Summer he’d be going on a trip with Karen, as the whole trip was nonrefundable and was planned a year in advance. 

At first he was very good to me and then things started to change. He would break plans with me right before we were supposed to meet, or he would just forget about the plans we made. However, he would occasionally text me late at night. He would tell me how much he missed me, how much he wanted to see/be with me, and sometimes he would say how much he loved me. When I would try to talk to him the morning after, he would be cold and sometimes unresponsive. 

Earlier in the summer, we bought tickets to a see a band we both liked, and the date of the concert was a few days before his trip. Despite my feelings, I didn't try to hug or kiss him. We had a great time at the show, but when we were leaving to go our separate ways, I told him I wouldn't text him while he was away with Karen. He looked a bit hurt and shocked, but didn't say anything. We didn't speak for the remainder of the summer (about three weeks) and it was very rough for me.

When the Fall semester came around, we bumped into one another. We started hanging out together and I found myself still having strong feelings towards him. Despite getting back together with Karen, he was cheating on her again. Then one night we went out with a group of friends, we all got very drunk, and I slept with Matt. The day after this he broke up for Karen.

A few weeks after breaking up with Karen, we started to date, but we denied it to all our friends when asked. This came crashing late in December, a few days before Christmas. We were celebrating the end of the semester with a ton of people at a bar. During the course of the night, he became very drunk and then made out with this girl he had just met right in front of me. It killed me and I ended up screaming at him and leaving the bar in tears. 

We made emends after that rough night, but things weren't smooth sailing. On New Years Eve, he posted a picture on his instagram of him with this girl, Liz. I talked to him about it and he said that she was a friend of one of his cousins and that I shouldn't be worried. Things were okay for a little bit, until his birthday, which was at the end of January. He had planned a big get together for his birthday, but the night before, he got very drunk with friends. On the day of his birthday, I called him and asked him about his plans for that night. He was very hung over and we started to argue. He told me not to come that night because he wanted to fool around with women. When the conversation was over, I was a complete crying mess. 

Over the next two months we talked sparingly, but my feelings were still strong. Then all of a sudden, he started dating Liz. He moved very quickly with her and professed his love for her in a love letter that he posted that on instagram. Again, we stopped talking and I was crushed. 

As June rolled around, he apologized to me and asked if we could hang out. He was apartment sitting for a friend who was going away for a few months and against better judgment, I hung out and met him there. It was obvious that he was living there with Liz and I was uncomfortable the whole time. Although nothing happened between us that day, I couldn't keep having strong feelings for him and I couldn't keep allowing him to treat me that way. I blocked him on my social media sites and programmed my phone to have any texts or calls sent to spam and auto-reject respectively. 

Over the summer I got a new phone, but kept my number. Since I set up the spam/auto reject on my old phone and not through my phone provider, his calls and text were able to go through. After three months of absolutely no contact, we started talking. And after two weeks of talking, we met up. He apologized for hurting me and explained that when we first met he was going through a really rough time and down a dark path. He hurt a lot of people in the process and was genuinely remorseful about it. He explained to me that he should have gotten so serious with Liz, but he was scared and latched on to her. The feelings we had for each other quickly came flooding back, and after a month, we started dating.


Matt has been really amazing these past two months. He’s apologized for all he’s done to me and is trying his best to show me how much he cares for me. Currently, he working full time and is in his last semester of college. He is taking enough credits to make him a full time student as well. He is very busy, but makes time to see me several times a week. He also cut back his drinking a lot. On the rare occasion that he goes out, he’ll either have two beers during the course of the night, or nurse a double shot of whiskey for the night. We have a long phone date about once a week and we text whenever we can. He’s even told me that the love letter he posted on instagram was written with me in mind, not Liz. 

Most of time, we have a great time together. We laugh a lot, have great conversation, and we’re really supportive of each other. We both push each other to do better and we both feel like we could potentially have a strong relationship, but I am having a hard time moving forward. When we’re together we’re great, but when we’re apart, I am angry at him and pushing him away. I often feel like he’s lying or hiding something from me and I know that’s hurting him a lot. 

Matt is a charming guy, who is a natural flirt, and there’s still a lot of women around him. He’s been upfront about telling me when Liz has called him, but I feel like he’s not telling me it all. He still likes some of Liz’s photos on instagram, along with liking a lot of photos of girls who are dressed in very revealing clothing. His phone is constantly buzzing from messages, the other day he told me that he’s sent a silly, but inappropriate snapchat to a female friend (I received it as well, but I felt it was inappropriate to send to anyone besides me), and as of late, his top 3 snapchat friends no longer include me.

A lot of our mutual friends can see a definitely change in him. All of them say that he’s done a complete 180, but I can’t help feeling this doubt. The rational side of me thinks I’m being neurotic and completely crazy. The rational side tells me that it’s normal that he likes all those photos on instagram (I like lots of photos on there too, along with everyone else as well!). He’s been spending every available minute he has with me, so I shouldn't feel like he’s cheating or trying to cheat. However, the emotional side of me is still incredibly hurt. He has done so much hurtful things in the past, what is stopping him from repeating what he’s done in the past?

Today, I've been in a bad mood towards him, and feeling like he's hiding something. I've been pushing on the subject all day, and this was our last text message exchange:

Matt: After clearly telling you why I chose you, and how I fucked up. I'm spending anytime I can trying to show you how much you mean to me and how I won't lose you again, and then you do this? 

I haven't responded yet because part of me really loves this man, and wants to really try and work this out. However, the other part of me is hurt and angry, and wants to cut him out of my life and leave. I am conflicted and I know that me being hot and cold toward him is unhealthy for either of us. 

I’m really lost and would really appreciate any sort of perspective. I sincerely thank you for reading all of this and I thank you for your advice in advance.

12322,Relationships,22pkwr," We were friends for about a year before dating, have fun together and can always make each other laugh. But the question of where do you see this going came up recently and he admitted to not thinking about our future and was just having fun. After talking he stated his fears of commitment but wanted to think of a future for us.


I know I'm close to wanting a family and don't know if I'm heading down a dead end street. I have no doubts that he cares about me, but this conflict has led to my doubting his strengths as a long-term partner. He isn't very responsible or independent and had relied financially on his parents for his whole life.


I'd like to think our bond is strong enough to weather these growing pains, but is making me laugh going to be enough to carry us through him having to learn to take care of himself (cleaning,budget, etc)? Am I patient enough to wait 2-3 years before we could even seriously talk of having a family?  


Would very much appreciate advice, especially if you stayed in or left a content relationship with concerns like this.

 Just a bit of background info, my boyfriend and I have been in a LDR relationship for some time but this has always worked for us. We have been together for three and a half years and we met when we were sixteen.

Okay so yesterday I met up with my boyfriend for a little date. About a couple hours into it he asks me to sit down and says we need to talk. It was a long and tearful conversation but essentially what he was saying was that he's not in the right place for a serious relationship. He also said he wants to break up with me in case we don't last, which he said would mean that he would have wasted his university experience. 

So basically what I got from that was that he wants to sleep around. However, he also started talking about how he doesn't want to lose me as a friend, that he feels like he can only be his true self around me. After some probing from me I find out that he wants to be friends with benefits.

I agreed to think about this even though I know that continuing to sleep with him while he is also sleeping with other girls would probably make me feel jealous. Since then he has continued to message me as normal, absolutely nothing has changed in our messages, they're still kind of flirty (which I know is because I kind of agreed to the friends with benefits thing).

I guess what I want to know is how I should proceed from here. I don't want to lose him as a friend because we do get on well and make each other laugh. But at the same time I know that remaining friends is going to make it hard for me to move on. Also does the friends with benefits proposal mean that there is hope or is he just trying to have the best of both worlds?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give me

I would love to take Zoey on a date, but I have absolutely no idea what to do. I cannot drive yet (and, unless I'm really far behind the 8-ball, Zoey can't, either; perhaps this is an indicator that I'm way too young for this stuff, or perhaps not), and I'm not sure what we would do, anyway, which is an obvious and large impediment. We have a good deal in common, like our involvement in our school's drama club, our friend groups, our classes, etc., but I still run short when it comes to ideas. Having not exactly been blessed with a knack for having these kinds of conversations, my aim is really to not sound awkward, however I do it. And I really don't want to tell my parents yet because they'll just grill me with unanswerable questions. 


One thing is working in my favor, though: communications. A few weeks ago, while Zoey and I were hanging out with several of our mutual friends, she gave me and one of our mutual friends her number (this mutual friend, a guy 2 years our senior, is no one to be suspicious of in this regard, or any other). Zoey doesn't have my number yet, though. That's another question I have, in case anyone read this far: since I am on Christmas break for a little under 2 weeks, should I text Zoey or just wait until after break, when I can give her my number personally?


I don't know how to tell Zoey how I feel, or how to ask her on a date, given the circumstances. You're my only hope, reddit. What should I do?

A month ago, before I met Ashlee, I wouldn't have even though myself ready to pursue someone. However, Ashlee is a really amazing girl. I trust her. But... I also don't trust her at the same time. 

So, obviously, this new information about Ashlee and her ex being close is toying with my mind. Right after she told me, she asked me if  I would feel better if she talked to him less. Of course, I wanted to say yes. However, I try to avoid being controlling or jealous in my relationships at all costs, so I just simply smiled, shrugged, and told her that I couldn't answer that. Luckily, right after that, her roommate walked in, which gave me the perfect chance to escape.

I got together with my girlfriend probaly just about a month ago, she is smart, funny and I really love her. Whenever I am together with her we have an amazing time and I am really happy with her and everything seems just fantastic. But I have a problem I just CAN'T understand, that has nothing to do with her, it's something I've completely made up in my own mind and i just can't understand where it comes from. 

Whenever she is gone I feel really anxious and start to think about how she has had sex and made out with guys before we even noticed each other or even were interested in each other and I feel really bad about it, to an extent that i have trouble sleeping. 

I also feel anxious if she doesn't answer to a text that i wrote, and I get scared that she would leave me or anything, I just can't understand why I feel this way. I've had a girlfriend before and I didn't have this problem. I'm not really sure what to do because this is just things that i make up in my mind and I really have no reason to feel this way. 

when we are together all these worries disappear and we always have a super great time together, but later when we haven't seen each other for awhile these thoughts come back and I really can't understand why!! 

I feel really bad for her sake aswell, because it's nothing that has anything to do with her and I just wan't to get these Irrational fears away because it's extremely infuriating.

I read all the comments on that post and they did help me alot. But I just can't cope with all this. She loved me like she had never loved anyone else, and although our relationship deteriorate over the last few months of it, I still loved her. And now, she keeps going out with her new friend, and it is making me suffer like hell, this is horrible. I thought I was the one for her, that she would do anything for us to be together. But then he showed up, 1 month after she breaks up with me saying she doesn't love me anymore, since then, she kissed him once (for all that I know), and now she keeps going out with him, she spends a lot of time with him, and I went from being everything to her to being nothing. She says she didn't breakup with me because of him, but it doesn't look that way. This hurts so much, being treated like dog shit by the girl that once gave you all.

I already tried for us to be back together, to show her that I can be a better man for her, for us, and for myself, but she just doesn't care.

We're currently going no contact, I asked her for it and she also agreed it is the best, but damn, why is this so hard, I feel like crap.
I was hoping that she would contact me, as she gave me a few hints (before no contact) that she still had feelings for me, but she didn't so far. Was our relationship so meaningless for her that she doesn't even want to fight for it? Is this guys so much better than me that she rather be with him after a 2 year relationship where she showed me nothing but love?

My girlfriend of over a year and I live together, and yesterday I came home from work to see her a curled up sobbing mess on the couch. Her makeup was smeared and she was wearing some oversized Drink Beer! top, which is funny because she doesn't even drink; hates it in fact. I'm immediately concerned so I go over to her, and I don't even think she realized I was home she was crying so hard. On the floor beside the couch was her notebook, open, and a scrapbook, open; pictures of her and her ex glued in. It's an old scrapbook. She's artsy.


I touch her shoulder and she tentatively looks up at me and starts crying harder. She's always been a sensitive person but she's never been like this. I ask her what's wrong. I can't remember it all extremely clear, to be honest, but she said she loves me and she feels awful and bad but she keeps thinking about her ex. She doesn't know what to do about it. She said sometimes her mind just drifts. I said that it was okay. I understand that exes are sometimes a big part of someone's life... Well, at one point they were, at least. They split amicably. I know this guy and honestly, he's a nice dude.


Anyway, she then said that she really is confused. Because she does love me. And that she loves him, too, in a different way. She said she felt like she moved on but then she got a text from him today saying that he's in love and thanking her for making her a better person or something. She said from there she just lost it. Broke down. Started crying. She said they text made her realized that she lost something she never wanted to lose, and now she really lost it and can't get it back. She then said that she realized she can no longer be with me because that would be unfair to me. At some point she she calmed down but she was still red and teary eyed.

And she said that I wasn't taking her seriously and the only option was to break up. And she said she was sorry. Really sorry. She said she would move out and stay with her parents and pay her rent even if she wasn't there. I wouldn't have it though. I told her that I would help her get him back and that I love her and that it's okay to be confused and that we will be okay. She just thought what I was proposing was insane. She said she couldn't talk any more, took a shower, went to sleep. I stayed out in the living room looking at the scrapbook. They did seem happy? Am I in the wrong to want to help?

The third may have happened due to my insecurities of what happened with the first two. I was extremely jealous and was always accusing her of cheating on me wherever she went. Granted, she was  doing other things behind my back (secret meth addict) but I probably didn't help the situation all that much; she ended up cheating on me with her drug dealer (he was the one who told me) and a couple other guys. Later, she told me she wanted to give me justification for all my claims. I thought it was shitty, but whatever I thought I was over it. 

Fast forward to my newest relationship. I'm with someone who I've known for awhile and is really good for me. She is not controlling like the last couple have been and she completely trusts me. Things had been going along relatively well, despite the age difference. This post isn't about that, and it's not really an issue with us. We get along really well and it's been really really great. 


However, my stupid jealousy has been creeping up. I've been letting my previous experiences with relationships cloud what I have now. My gf has been extremely patient with me and hasn't really lashed out and has been very understanding of my situation (she knows about my previous relationships). We recently went on separate vacations and that really messed us up, though. She is still friends with some people she hooked up with in college and she saw them (most, if not all are married now) and my brain went into full on she's cheating mode. She's not the cheating type but she told me she didn't really care in college,  and I just automatically assumed that's what was happening. I didn't mean to, but I was trying to control the situation and keep tabs even though  I shouldn't have. I nearly ruined both our vacations because I couldn't get my head out of my ass. Now, she also works with one of her more recent exs and last night I asked if that would ever be a problem and she lost it. She said I don't trust her even though I say I do, and that this relationship was fun and easy going but I'm making it was too much. And I know I am. I don't want to fuck this up, because I really like her. 


I don't know how to stop my mind from instantly going to that place of instant accusation. I'm so worried that she's going to cheat on me with one of her friends or exs or one of my friends, and I know I shouldn't. I don't want her to feel like she needs to walk in eggshells around me and I don't want her to think I'm not ready for this, because I really feel like I am. Other than this, we have zero problems. This could be something that lasts awhile and I'm just shitting the bed with it because I'm making her deal with my issues from previous relationships. How do I get out of this vicious cycle so all I need to do is focus on being happy with my current gf?

12334,Relationships,1t2qdm,"I have an interesting situation that I really don't know where else to put and this seems like a good thread to get some advice on. Basically, there's this girl I met at grad school who I have known for over a year. She has had a longterm boyfriend for about 5 years now. I have definitely had a crush on her for quite a while, but I have always respected her relationship and have always treated her unequivocally as a friend. Interestingly, she has always done things that have seemed much too flirty for me for having such a longterm boyfriend.


Example #1: she has on two occasions said that she would cuddle on the couch with me. She always comes very close to me, but I move away because I don't want to cross the line and probably cause I have qualms because I actually am attracted to her. I just assumed she has 100% platonic feelings and that I did not want to get confused so I kept my distance.

Example #2: Many times she will lay her head on my shoulders for a couple seconds. I don't respond...I have always felt that my natural response would be to put my arm around her. But I think for me that would mean more, so I just sit passively.


Example #3: We have talked many times about my philosophy of deep love and relationships, i.e. everyone knows that I am sort of a hopeless romantic and they often joke that I am Ted from How I Met Your Mother. As a friend, or so I thought, she offered companionship to me. I had no idea what this means. But she basically said it involved grocery shopping together, cooking dinner together, watching movies together, etc. I was confused and refused it because I didn't understand it. Plus, I didn't want to waste my time with her knowing that she never wanted to pursue romance with me.


Anyway, all of this culminated last Friday, when after hanging out a bar with a couple of friends, she made a comment about me refusing her companionship and also put her head on my shoulders several times. Again, this was in the context of all our friends talking about me being Ted from How I Met Your Mother--and I was going on how about he was pathetic and blah blah. So I thought this head on shoulders bit was...pity.


Finally, we got in her car to take me home. And somehow the companionship bit got brought up again and I told her I didn't really get it and in a round about way, how that it could make me develop emotional feelings for her. I didn't really think she was going to say anything, but suddenly she mentioned that she now recently was in a open relationship with her boyfriend of five years. She immediately regretted telling me. But now I knew, and then I felt like all these signs from before were because maybe it was a result of her open relationship. Things got kinda awkward fast and I couldn't get much more detail. Hilariously, we went over to my house and watched two episodes of How I met your Mother.


She went home for four weeks for Winter Break. Don't really know what to think. Should I try to pursue something? I don't really know. Should I make a move? I would feel terrible if I tried to put my arm around her or kiss her at some event and she rejected me and then made our awesome friendship awkward. Help me Reddit!

So this is a long post... a few people I know in real life may get a taste of what the relationship I was in was like, especially with some details that I've withheld previously, but it is what is is... or was...  It was messy, confusing and hard.  Seems it's totally done now and I feel completely lost.  I'm a bit drunk, so please excuse any rambling, typos, etc.


So I met my ex back in 2007 while I lived on the East Coast.  We were both dating people at the time but we hit it off so amazingly well that we decided to stay in touch as friends.  We chatted here and there, saw other people, whatever; but eventually timing and location was right and we started dating.  I had moved back home to MN, she moved out here for college.  After a few family tragedies, she moved home to her home state of South Carolina 1300 miles away.  We decided to continue a LDR, and things were good and drama free for about 4 months.


Then she was raped.  She ran into an ex boyfriend at a bar while there with her brother, commiserating after one of their other brothers died in a car accident.  Her ex said something to her, her brother took offense, and beat the hell out of him.  The next day he called her and said he wanted to apologize, they met in a parking lot, and he raped her.  It was a tough time, but we made it through.  A side effect of the rape was a child.   A beautiful baby boy I came to love.  I thought about leaving her a few times because of the difficulties of everything, but I realized I loved her more than I loved anyone ever, and was going to stick it out.


Well last year in October, after finishing undergrad and shopping around for med schools, she got a job in Baltimore, and since Johns Hopkins was on her list, she moved up there.  I was unemployed at the time and started looking for a job in the area.  In November, she admitted she had started to have feelings for a co-worker and wanted to explore where things could go.  She left me, I found a job in my home state, and we stopped talking.  For about 3 months. 


She got in touch with me again... It turned out he was gay (what?!) but, she wanted to keep things loose between us because apparently the distance was getting to her.  We kept talking, and things started getting back to how they were until in late August, she grew distant again.  This continued for a few months, until in October she told me there was someone else.  I accepted it, because even if we weren't in a relationship, I still loved her as a person and wanted to stay involved in her life and the life of the boy who I had come to love.


Our contact has been intermittent since then.  Sometimes we'd talk 2-3 days in a row, sometimes weeks without contact.  It had started to be weeks recently, and I am going to be in her hometown on a destination bachelor party.  Not only that, but my dad was going to be moving there because he got a great job in a much warmer climate.  I was hoping that maybe we could get together for lunch and a drink or two, just so I could see the baby, and maybe get some closure; if not while I'm there for the party, maybe while I was visiting my dad over the holidays.  While talking, she told me that things were getting more serious with her boyfriend (who is apparently also her boss) and she didn't think she would come down to see me, because it would be too hard for me and that she wanted to get some distance.  Eventually, she said that she wanted to break contact with me fully.


I'm lost.  Like... I have no idea what to do.  I thought we'd always be in touch, always at least be on the periphery of one anothers lives and now I feel like I've lost not only the person I love, but someone who was one of my best friends.


I don't even know what to do.  I guess I don't know what I want to hear.  Advice, comments, commiseration.  Hell, even just someone to drink with would be nice at this point.  I keep randomly sobbing because I know I will miss her so much.


I guess I just need to vent.  This all sucks.  Every part of it.

She's told me she sees us getting married and that I'm the love of her life. Everything was going great but for the past six months, she has changed so much. She's been a lot less affectionate, which is something every couple goes through, but we went through 3 months without any sex at one point because she was so stressed and said she had changed birth control pills and that causes that sometimes. I completely understood at the time and supported her even though, I mean, I'm a man so that was difficult to say the least. 

After that things got better, but now things have getting worse. I feel there's a huge imbalance in our relationship, I give a lot more of my time support and thought into her than she does for me, in other the words the things I do for her, she wouldn't do for me. It's sad to say but there so many examples of this. Her personality is the type that isn't very easy to talk to about issues as she never admits she's wrong and it takes her a long time to say sorry. We've had countless talks were I've expressed myself calmly and she says she understands yet nothing changes.

 Lately she's been easily irritated, and puts her stress towards me and it's gotten to a point where it's so difficult to support her and I feel I can't take it anymore. I'm getting the feeling that I deserve better, and this relationship is doing more harm than good for me.

Let me give you some background: I have known him since we were 10 years old. We went to the same school and I was the nerdy chubby girl and he was in the popular group. When he was 11 his mother passed away of cancer and in the next coming years his dad lost his business and they became homeless.


Fast forward to when I was 17, we reconnected and started hanging out a lot. By that time he was moving from couch to couch by himself and I wanted to be a good friend to him and be there. I found myself liking him but then I became sick and no one could figure out what was wrong with me. After about a year of seeing different specialists and they diagnosed me with two things: something called Intracranial hypertension (a condition where too much spinal fluid is produced and literally squeezes your brain which can result in blindness and seizures) and a pituitary macroadenoma (a large brain tumor).


I don't really want to go into specifics regarding my meds and treatments but as of recent it has progressed and gotten worse. Anyways, after I got diagnosed I told him and was like either you can be supportive like I need you to be right now or we can spend some time apart. It was too much at that point so we went our separate ways for a little bit while I was going through some treatment.


He came back but he was never showing his affection and didn't want to be intimate which for me I am a very sexual person so seeing as he seemed reluctant to even touch me I slept with other guys when we weren't together. Last time me and him had sex it was November of 2013 and the last time I had sex it was late March of this year. We became official in April after me giving up because I couldnt stand the fact I was in love with someone who didnt care. In April he showed up at my house and said it was hard for him to show that he cares because everyone has left him in some way and when i got sick he thought I was going to leave him. He said that he loved me and couldnt be without me. It is now almost August and we still haven't had sex.


I understand he doesn't like to see me in pain. I understand that he finds it hard to trust people. But if I was going to leave him for good I would have done it a long time ago. He is doing better than ever right now. He works 80+ hours a week, bought himself a 2011 Caddy, and rents himself a cute little house. What 19 year old can say that got themselves off the streets and accomplished this for themselves? I am so proud of him.


I just wish he could be more affectionate and that I can have sex with my boyfriend. Sorry for the long story but I think everything was relevant. Advice redditors? PM me if you have any questions or are going through something similar.

12342,Relationships,1wfv0c,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text (sorry, sorry, sorry). I will try to keep it brief and to the point!

**Optional background (but helpful):**

Two years ago (freshman year of college - we're juniors now), I met this guy in one of my classes (we'll call him S). I didn't really think anything of him at first, but I could tell he was really into me and I liked him enough as a person to work on homework and study together. We both come from the same city, and during summer break he asked me to hang out. It was going fine and dandy until I made a very sarcastically judgmental comment at one point in our conversation. I tend to be extremely outspoken and opinionated, but I would never ever make a comment like that if I had actually meant it. Since he didn't know me very well, he didn't realize this, and after that lunch date he didn't call me for the rest of summer. I should point out that I did not even realize his silence until he pointed it out to me a few months later - I just really wasn't into him as anything more than a friend. 

The very first week of sophomore year, I notice he's been hanging out with a girl a lot (she'll be A). One of our mutual friends confirmed that they were dating, and it took me ten minutes to get ridiculously jealous. I still saw him a lot, during class and when we did homework together, and we got lunch together three times a week, and as stupid as it sounds, I tried so hard to get with him. He got me to join an intramural soccer team with him, and he would walk me home at night. He was always really flirty (so was I...), and so nice to me. Any time I went out with someone else (never seriously, just lunch dates and stuff), he would text me right after how it went, and tell me they weren't good enough for me. Things like that. We never did anything physical at all, but I was just waiting for it, even to the point where I had asked my friends how to stop it, because I didn't want to be that kind of person. 

Eventually we had a blow up (like in October of sophomore year) where he denied there ever being anything more than friendship between us, although he admitted to having feelings for me over the summer, but that I had ruined it with my comment. I did not believe any of what he said, but I had nothing else to do, so I just left it. For the rest of the semester, we were just civil to each other, did homework together, and it was fine. 

Spring semester of sophomore year, we had almost all our classes together, and we became best, best friends. I was incredibly into him, and I realized I was in love with him about halfway through the semester, when it made me cry that he hadn't told me he wouldn't be coming to lecture one day because he was on a trip for his sports team. It turned into another long talk about what we were doing (we had these A LOT that semester), but he continued to deny that he had anything more than friendly feelings for me. I still didn't believe anything, because of the comments he made to me about my looks, my personality, how much time he spent with me (now outside of homework and studying and classtime, too), the fact that he never brought up his girlfriend (we actually had a rule about this), and how differently he treated me when she was with us (this almost never happened because she hates me, very understandably). 

He took an internship in Europe over this last summer, so I didn't see him for three months. Right before he left, we had a whole longfelt talk where he told me I was his best friend ever, and that he cared about me so much. For my birthday, which was a few days after he left, he wrote me a long letter, left me birthday song voicemails, and wrote me a birthday poem, which he sent as a voice recording. I started dating someone else a week after S left (J), and I was incredibly excited about it, because J was so sweet to me, so attractive, and we had great chemistry. A few days after my first date with J, which had gone really well, S skyped me (we were messaging literally all day long anyways, but this one happened over video) and finally admitted to me that he was jealous, that he has always had feelings for me, and that I make him happier and laugh harder than anyone else ever has. I told him that I've always known that, and that I couldn't understand why he was still with his girlfriend when we would be so great together. He told me, verbatim, I am not ready to settle down with the person I will end up with, you know that. We weren't together last summer, we're not together now, but we both know how this will end. The skype conversation took hours, and I cried at the end because the situation was awful. After a lot of thought, I told S we couldn't talk anymore while he was with A, and I focused on dating J, because that was going so well.

When J and I broke up towards the end of summer, S and I started talking again and we went straight back to our normal - messaging all the time, saying sweet things, him telling me J was never good enough, etc. When he came back from Europe, I was the first person he saw (before his girlfriend), and we spent all day together. We never really brought up the skype conversation, or the break we had taken.

At the beginning of this school year, S and I got in another big fight about our situation. It ended in me telling him I couldn't be friends with him because he is ridiculous, and I was fine with it. We ended up not talking for several months, but we were okay again by December. This is how things always go with us - it's difficult to stay away from each other. 

I saw him multiple times over winter break. The times we hung out were much more date-like than anything we had ever done. It felt very different. When he hugged me goodbye on one of those nights, he held me for a long time and stroked my hair, which he's never done before. 

Two days ago he told me he broke up with his girlfriend. He asked to get lunch with me today, and we did, and it was fine. We didn't bring up her or their breakup at all.


**To summarize my main feelings after that long, long background:**

1. I love him so very much.
2. He is my best friend, probably ever. He knows me more than anyone, and I can be my complete self around him, and he has never judged me for it. When I am honestly upset (medical issues, family problems, major uncertainty), he is the person I want to talk to, and he has never let me down about being there for me. 
3. We can have fights without beating each other up. Due to the nature of our situation, we have had many uncomfortable conversations, and many of those have included crying. We've always worked through it respectfully and honestly.
4. We would be logistical heaven. Our families come from the same place in Europe, we speak the same languages, he's intelligent, we're from the same city, we're in the same major, our families love each other too. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but I feel like if we got together, I could see that lasting forever.
5. This is the first time we have both been single at the same time in years and I have been waiting for this forever.
6. Our friends have never thought that our friendship was a good idea, with some going so far as to cut off contact because of how fucked up they thought this was. We have had lots of talks about this, and both never cared about what they thought because it's always felt right to us.

**What I need help with:**
1. Do I bring up the issue of us to him at all? Or should I wait for him to?
2. Should I address their breakup at all? I want to be there for him if he's having a hard time, but I'm not sure if it seems too transparent or backhanded.
3. I understand that probably he will need time to be single (he was with her for 1.5 years). But we both know that we've had feelings for each other, and I feel like it's the elephant in the room. I don't know what to do. 
4. It's Valentine's Day soon. I would love to do something for him. Is that wrong?

I feel like I have to try, or I will regret it forever. Any help would be so appreciated.

Now this may or may not be relative, but he is my first boyfriend. And when I say first I mean literally first, I never had 2 week long relationships in high school or anything, so being crazy about someone who returns the feeling and having someone who is by my side is new, but very nice feeling.

My boyfriend is 2 years younger, and he has ADHD, so he can get a little hyper at times and for the most part it doesn't phase me because that's who he is and I like who he is. I read up about dating someone with ADHD and saw that it can be difficult for many reasons (over hyper, can't concentrate, etc..) so I sort of knew what to expect. Plus I think he just generally has a more hyper personality, and he's still young so a mix of those things has given my a pretty goofy boyfriend.

Mostly it is my fault because I am more reserved and shy, and I don't like lots of attention put on me in public. So today we went shopping and he ended up buying a halloween costume for the party we're going to at his friends house, and not really to my surprise, but he's going as a vagina. And that itself makes me a bit embarrassed because after buying it we went around the mall to get other parts he needed (pants, shoes) and he told every cashier or employee we encountered. A lot of them laughed, the usual reaction I expected. 

This is his humor and personality, and I don't want to change who he is or make him change his costume or stifle his energy in any way. I want to embrace every aspect of his personality. The majority of the time I adore his hyper personality and his sense of humor (even though it isn't that similar to mine) but it's difficult for me to be in public with him when he does these little things because I'm very self concious and self aware of my surroundings and I really want to not care the way he does. I don't want to be embarrassed when we go to the party on Halloween, I don't want to care that I'm the girl with the boyfriend who's dressed as a vagina.

Is there anything I can do internally to stop myself from feeling this way? I know I shouldn't care what complete strangers think, but my stupid brain will always think this way even slightly no matter how much I care about him.

It is a rather unusual situation given that he still lives with his wife (they are seperated) They share a gigantic house, and he has his own apartment downstairs. I'm cool with all of this..as I know I can trust him, and I'm 100% certain that their relationship is over. 
The trouble is, his family are all getting together tonight for New Years Eve celebrations. They know about me, and they are eager to meet me...however he spoke to me today and said he would prefer if I didn't go to the celebration and waited for next week instead to meet everyone. 

I feel very left out and sidelined. I do realise I am being a little bit childish here, but I just think that it's completely normal to want to spend New Years with your boyfriend? He even said in a joking fashion My mother wants you to be here more than I do!! lolol Obviously, I did not laugh. :/ Is he just being thoughtless? 

Am I being totally stupid here? God I need some advice...in all other ways he pays attention to me, treats me well and tells me how much he loves me. But tonight I am not invited, on the contrary I was told there would be a better time to meet everyone. I feel so hurt and upset..any advice would be great, thank you.

12354,Relationships,2tswhd,"My fiancee and I had a fight last night and today and I need to know what I did wrong here. My heart is in so much pain right now and I am exhausted and I can't have this happen anymore. My apologies ahead of time for the wall of text, I want to be fair and get all the important details in.

My fiancee and I fight frequently. We have sought counseling and went for the first time on Thursday. Since Wednesday, we had been very good. We were in love, positive, and not fighting. This lasted until last night.

We had spent a lot of the past few days together, lovingly, affectionate. It was all the things you want in a partner. She came to an office holiday party at a bar with me. We had a great time, we were physically close, laughing, things were good. We come home, and I'm supposed to go watch the royal rumble at a friend's home. I'm not sure I want to go, she suggests that I do. I left a sweatshirt at the bar, so I go to retrieve that, and then go watch the show with some friends.
During the show she sends me a very sweet text message. It says that she loves me and will forever. I'm her guy and she adores me. Needless to say that's a wonderful text to get. I don't know much about wrestling at all, but regardless I'm enjoying telling jokes and hanging out with some friends. I don't respond to the text message.

After the show, I come home and go into our room to check in and give her a hug and a kiss and say goodnight. She is in bed. She had been watching a tv show that made her feel very emotional and brought her to tears. It made her think of me, and it turns out that is why she sent the text message. She wants me to get in bed with her and cuddle, and watch a show with her. I'm not feeling up to it at that moment, as I kind of just want some alone time. I give her another hug and a kiss, and tell her goodnight.

I'm out in the living room with my laptop open. I'm reading the comments thread of something on reddit. She comes out to the living room and asks me to rub her shoulders, as they are bothering her. So I do. I give her a good firm rub on the spots that bother her for awhile, then stop after my hands start to hurt. We're talking about nothing in particular. She points to another spot on her back and asks me to rub it, and I do. I get worn out a little bit quicker this time and stop.
She moves on the couch and asks what the problem with me is. I tell her there is no problem I just want to be alone for a bit right now. She starts telling me that she is really upset with how I've acted (she has interpreted me not responding to the text and not wanting to cuddle in bed and watch TV as a rejection and a slight, so she is upset) I tell her that I am not rejecting her and I still love her very much, I just want to be on my own for a bit. I tell her everything is fine. She starts getting more angry, saying that I get enough alone time as it is (I'm a total night owl) and that I'm inconsiderate of her feelings, which she feels I have negated by telling her that everything is fine right now.

I start to get annoyed, it's after 11pm and she needs to work the next day, so I don't think it's a good idea to fight about this. I tell her that I'm not negating her feelings and me needing to have alone time has nothing to do with her, and it's nothing personal. I tell her again that I love her. She gets even more upset and while she is speaking I interrupt and say that maybe we should just let this one go, it isn't worth a fight. She gets more upset because I've interrupted her. At this point it is clear that I am very annoyed by this, but I'm still not lashing out any accusations. She keeps going. I'm asking her to please stop, let's not fight. Maybe she should just go to bed. Everything I'm saying is making her more and more upset. I tell her I'm going outside, at this point it is clear to anybody that my annoyance has grown to frustration. I go outside and smoke a cigarette.

When I come back in, she comes back into the living room. I ask her to please stop this isn't worth it. She firmly says no, she has something to say. This time I try to engage reasonably with her. She again starts saying that she feels rejected, belittled, and so on. She feels like her feelings don't matter to me. I tell her that she can't demand affection from her partner, it has to be given willingly. This upsets her, stating that it's unfair that in that case I get whatever I want whenever I want it, since she is always available to give affection and doesn't need alone time. I ask her to please stop, let's not fight. I calmly say that I still love her very much, that we can talk about it later, but right now things are very heated so perhaps it's best that we don't go point for point right now. I say that the only thing it will accomplish is making us both more and more upset. She won't stop or walk away. I start looking down and shutting down, not really responding, just looking down and letting her vent. She vents for a long time until I eventually say that I get it and I've heard her, but I really don't want to respond as it will just egg things on. She still feels her feelings are negated, and she refuses to leave the room until I apologize for my actions. I say that I don't think I've done anything wrong here, but we can discuss it later. She keeps going, mocking my alone time through voice and air quotes. Saying it's ridiculous, why can't I just put my needs to the side for a second and consider what she needs. She says I'm undependable, that I'm being a cold jerk, etc. I keep looking down and I say that I get that she feels this way but perhaps we should have this discussion at a later time. She then demands that I look her in the eye. I don't. She is demanding again and again that I look her in the eye, and show her the respect she deserves. I pick up a hoodie from the couch and I lay down, just completely giving up. I put the hoodie over my face and eyes and start begging her again to please stop and just leave the room, that what is happening right now is only doing damage.

At this point I am exhausted and upset. I feel like I am backed into a corner with no chance of escape. Everything I say is wrong, and if I say nothing that is wrong too. I am doing my best not to engage. I am just asking her to please just walk away and we can do it later. She won't stop, she won't walk away. She demands I look her in the eye. I say that won't stop her and please to just stop and walk away, we are both being hurt by this. She pulls the hoodie off of me and demands I look her in the eye. I am near tears by this point. I ask her please to just give me the hoodie back, she is still demanding I look at her when I speak to her. I finally look her in the eyes and I say 'Please stop this! Can't you see you're only doing damage right now!' I unplug my laptop and make for the guest room with it. All the while she is saying that I need to own up and apologize for my actions. I go into the guest room. I am extremely angry and upset at this point.

I leave the guest room to get my pillow so I can sleep separate from her. As I'm in the room she says to just stay there, her clothes are in the guest room and it will be easier for her in the morning. I simply say 'no'. She engages some more. And I finally respond that this argument simply isn't worth it and she is tearing me apart with this relentless insistence on a fight. I tell her it's killing me. I tell her again that she can't demand affection from me and that I am somebody who needs alone time. She thinks it's stupid and I say that we're different people and that's okay that she doesn't need time to herself but I do, and to please respect that. Every question I have about her actions goes unanswered, anything I have to say about her behavior is met with a counter about my own behavior. Nothing is coming of this, I cannot get her to listen or stay on topic. She rolls her eyes at me, gives sarcastic thumbs up, and even at one point sarcastically starts clapping with 'yay! You wont the argument! Great job!'. I ask her why she thinks it's okay to do things like that. She won't answer, she changes the subject again. I again ask her why it's okay to do things like that. She won't answer. I finally leave the room, and stay in the guest room. I fall asleep, it is after 2am at this point.

I stay in the room, and when I wake up I can hear that she has not gone to work. She is doing laundry. I stay in the room, laying there, doing nothing for a few more hours, making sure things have simmered down. Around 3:30pm I decide it is okay to leave the room. I go to the bathroom, and then back out to the living room and open up my laptop. She comes out and wants me to go through my clothes and decide which ones to throw away. I say I'm not going to do that at this time. I am still very very upset, but still not engaging. She wants to talk about last night, and I say I am not ready to talk about last night. She keeps going and I firmly say no, I will not talk about this with her at this time.
I ask her to please just stop talking at walk away. I tell her that this is only going to make us both more and more upset, and to please stop talking and walk away. When she starts to talk, I tell her no, I am not willing to listen. Please stop talking and walk away. She says she needs info from me, I ask what, it's a roommate question I have answered in the past. I tell her I've already answered and to please now walk away. She replies angrily that how can she even trust that previous answer when I change my mind all the time. I tell her again, regardless of who she feels about my answers to questions, to please stop talking and walk away. After a bit she says she needs information from me. I ask what, she says she needs the garbage taken out. I said I'd do it, now to please walk away. She starts bringing up more things and I refuse to keep answering them. I tell her that anything I have to say is just going to prolong the conversation, and make us both more and more upset. I insist again and again that she please stop talking and walk away. After a full 26 minutes of this, I was watching my clock. She finally leaves. As she leaves she makes a comment about how 'She's doing my fucking laundry' and I respond with mockery. She comes back into the room, at this point screaming as loud as she possibly can. I have had enough, and at this point I mock her again, screaming. I ask her to please, end this conversation. Just. Walk. Away. She is livid, screaming. She won't stop. Again, I'm trapped.

I remember the advice of my psychiatrist, who said that next time she gets like this I should take cell phone video, as that might get her to relent. I take out my phone and start recording, asking her to please walk away. It works, and she does. To myself I say, 'Okay, the camera works.' She hears this enters the room again and is screaming. I point the camera at her and say please to just walk away from this. She attempts to grab my cell phone out of my hand. I stop her and pull her on the couch and hold her down. I did not strike her, choke her, or anything that would cause any harm to her body. She starts screaming to get off of her, and, remaining as calm as I can, I ask her to please drop the phone and I will let her go. She will not drop the phone, she is holding it has tightly as she can. She screams more, I ask her to please drop the phone. She will not. She grabs my glasses from my face and throws them across the room. I ask her to please drop the phone. She finally does, and I let her go immediately. I am standing over her, trying to find my phone. I can't see anything because of my glasses. She is screaming over and over to get off of her. I repeat over and over that I am not touching her. Step away, she was on top of my phone. I feel around for my glasses (my eyesight is terrible) and eventually find them.

She locks herself in the bathroom and I tell her that all she had to do was walk away, that all this happened because she didn't cuddled when she wanted to. We fight some more. She pushes me and hits me several times, I ask her to stop. Eventually I just walk away, buy more cigarettes (I'm desperate to quit, but this fights make me so upset my brain just ends up screaming for them), and I come home and post this.

I know there are times when I should have disengaged, I know I allowed myself to get too upset at some points when I just should have not responded. I guess I had just lost my temper to the point where I lost some control. I really tried here. Please let me know what I could have done differently. Especially at the beginning when she was upset about the text message not being responded to and me not cuddling in bed with her.

I am completely at a loss. I absolutely love this woman but she loses control and drives me absolutely crazy. Once she feels she has something to say, she absolutely must say it, and I must respond. Every response I give is always wrong. If I disagree she keeps going, if I try to agree she thinks I'm just placating her, if I say nothing she gets even more upset, if I politely ask her to leave she refuses. I feel trapped and ignored and cornered and berated. Please help me fix this problem. I want to marry her, but I cannot live the rest of my life like this.Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.

EDIT: Thank you for the replies. There are a lot of responses talking about her need for reassurance and coming across cold. Those are totally valid, and it's advice I will take with me into the future, thank you. I just wanted to add that how I treated her in this instance is NOT usual. We had spent much of the day together at a party, where we were physical, holding each other, making each other laugh, and just generally very much in love. The past several days were the same. I was happy to cuddle and hold her, take her to nice places to eat, and tell her how I felt about her. Lots of physical and verbal affection from me that again I am happy to give. It makes me happy to see her happy. To reiterate I have a much better understanding of what I did wrong here. I guess my one remaining question is how it is that even after so much affection and love being expressed so consistently, including that very day, why is it that this one instance of not expressing the affection she wanted at that time enough to send everything crumbling down? And why is it okay for her to put me in a situation where no response is the right response? What should I have said when confronted?

Oh, and I give VERY good back rubs. :) I rub her back every time I hold her and she loves it. I know exactly how she likes to be rubbed and I didn't do it half assed this time, either. :)

Once again thank you for the replies.

12355,Breakups,3d0o3c,"I began dating my girlfriend, a girl I really care for in early April. Both of us live with our strict parents. (Hers are more protective due to the fact she is their only child who can inherit their business). Combined with our full time summer jobs there haven't been many comfortable or private places we could have sex in the beginning. Since she was a virgin she wanted to wait in the beginning for an ideal place to do it. When it happened I couldn't have sex with her due to nervousness and being limp. As soon as I put the condom on I went limp. I told her it was natural since it was a long time and she assured me it was fine. We both laughed it out.

Flash forward a week later it happened again and I cried after. (Not in front of her, by myself). She thought we didn't have done enough foreplay, because I wasn't turned on but I was so nervous from last time. However the next couple of times we tried without the nervousness being there every time I managed to get it in I came immediately. (A premature ejaculation problem) Since when I put the condom on I lost a bit of the hardness and when she or I made it hard again I was already near climax. The last time this happened was two days ago. As soon as I came when I put it in I went silent and walked out of the room and made her leave. She got upset not because it was over but because of the silent treatment I gave her. 

She's sweet and understanding (I hope) and we had amazing experiences outside of the bedroom but I can't continue. 5 or 6 times I tried and its soul crushing. I can't even workout anymore since I feel emasculate.  Fuck this all to hell. I just want to be by myself so I don't have to disappoint two people.

12356,Relationships,3cnggq,"I have a good boyfriend, he's caring and understanding. He treats me well and is rarely disrespectful. For about a year now, we've been in a good solid relationship, for the most part. 

I'm a lot more extroverted than he is, and I understand that. I also understand that I was used to a more active lifestyle than he was. (I used to go out quite a bit, and I like to hike) When we first started dating he seemed to have no problem with me wanting to hike, and he made it seem like he was into it as well. 

Nowadays whenever we do anything that requires going out he complains about it. Whether it's about the money he's going to have to spend or the time he'll be away from doing work. It really sucks the fun out of doing anything. 



For example: 6 weeks ago, we went to the Grand Canyon- camping with his friends and my brother, it was the first time any of us had been there and i, being a big nature person, was super excited. a few days before we went on the trip, him and i were discussing it and he said that he just felt like the weekend was going to waste. [note: we took my car, and i paid for the majority of the trip but i didn't mind] I was pretty upset at him saying that a trip I was looking forward to was a waste of time but whatever. we went and it was pretty nice, we did argue but it wasn't a bad trip.

After that, his birthday came up and I really went all out for him (probably more than I should have, but I really love him). I made him a book (kinda like a scrapbook) that documented our relationship and things we liked or experienced together, I took him out for dinner then had his friends surprise him at a bar in LA, I also got us a night a a luxury hotel with a private pool. I know I was pretty extravagant, but I tend to be when it comes to gifts. I just wanted to make him really happy, and he was pretty happy. He was grateful and all, just not as I had thought. 



Since then we haven't really gone out. It's been about a month, and I figured we were taking things slow since I am out of a job, and we had a pretty good few weeks. I mostly went over to his house and honestly I thought our relationship was at it's best.

This week one of his friends invited me to go hiking, and I said yes. (Of course my boyfriend included in the invite) I told my boyfriend and he wasn't too thrilled about it, then his friend told me we might go camping instead, and that made my boyfriend even more unhappy. I'm quite passive so I said it was fine if we didn't go (even though I really want to) then my boyfriend said that it was fine if we went because *I wasn't going to be able to go* otherwise. I told him that it didn't matter because I had been to the park before but he insisted. 

I suffer from anxiety. Knowing that he didn't want to go and that he's doing it begrudgingly really bugs me. It literally makes my skin crawl to feel he's only doing something to keep me happy. It seems like when he agrees to do something he has to make me feel bad about wanting to do said thing first. 



Today we went to the gym and I told him I'd treat him to ice cream once we got out. He started complaining about all the reasons we shouldn't get ice cream so I told him that it was fine that he could just take me home. Then he was like, No come on lets go get ice cream. 
Angrily I told him to take me home, and then he made it seem like I was being unreasonable. 
He always does that, it's a cycle of me suggesting something, him complaining about it, me saying it's okay if we don't, then him insisting that we should and making me do it anyway. Nothing is enjoyable that way!

I just don't understand why he's so negative about everything. He only seems to be happy when we're not doing anything and he's at home. Does he just not want to put in the effort to be in a relationship with me? I mean, couples should want to go out, and experience life together right? I don't mind staying in, and I quite enjoy netflix marathons, but I also consider myself an adventurer and I like to explore and get out and do stuff. 

We've talked about this before, and it always seems like things will get better, and they do for a while, but I end up back here wondering why he doesn't want to go out with me. We've talked about moving in together, and eventually maybe marriage... but I don't know. I don't want someone who makes me feel bad for wanting to do something, and then insists on doing it anyway. Am I being unreasonable, or too demanding of him?

I know, as he's told me many times, that he isn't put off by it, doesn't find my constant horniness unattractive, but on an internal level, I worry this isn't true. FWBs in the past have told me I have too strong of an appetite, and I read often online about low libido boyfriends who are turned off by their girlfriends' needs. There's on thing in particular that always stings a bit. My BF lives on the same floor in my dorm as I do, and across the hall from an old FWB of mine (actually the guy who took my virginity, lol, long story, not relevant). This FWB and I, when we were involved, would have sex pretty much every day, until he told me I was too much and he needed recharge time. But my BF has told me how he can hear the FWB and his current GF having sex every hour of the day, as he puts it.   
1) This makes me feel uncomfortable about my own desires, if he wants this with his current GF but not with me when we were FWB.  
2) My BF has stated how he thinks this is absurd/ridiculous, and kinda refers to the FWB's sex drive in a derogatory manner. I always feel a little pinch when he does that, sort of a well, I had sex with him that much, and it was pretty much perfect for me, and I wish you wanted me as much as he seemed to want to before sort of way.  
Issue #2 is the one that hurts more. I feel bad, because I already fantasize about my exFWB sometimes (he was amazing at oral, loved to give it; BF doesn't do it and sometimes I miss that amazing tongue), and it just makes me feel down that an old FWB seemed to be more into me, sexually, than my current BF. I said something to my BF, when he made another of those comments, along the lines of you know, there's something to be said for having sex every hour of the day, and he just laughed and said that he doesn't even understand how someone could want to have sex that much. Which hurt more.  
How can I try to be more comfortable with this sort of attitude?

I went against the grain and followed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3axmkp/update_she_23f_my_girlfriendbestfriend_of_154/csgyadi) advice from the last thread. It was a fun trip I didn't expect to turn out so well. We had a good conversation about our breakup and relationship as well. All my remaning answers were answered and she made it clear that there is no hope of getting back together. I feel somehow finally relieved and got some peace. I'm finally able to start moving on. Plus we still get along well on the platonic level and so everything turned out better than expected. I feel so much better now. So no contact is not always the right choice.

Just a little bit of backstory: it took forever before my girlfriend and I officially got together, with our feelings confessed months beforehand, she always refused to become official until about 6 or 7 months ago.


So recently, my girlfriend and I have had a rough patch. We've been having lots of arguments over little things. A big problem I had was with feeling unwanted because she never initiated anything or showed affection to me. Throughout all these arguments, one thing she kept repeating was that this is why I didn't want a relationship at first because it complicates friendships too much. (which ties into the difficulty of becoming official in the first place).


But tonight, as we were having yet another small dispute, she just said she wanted to be just friends in her words. I thought it would be over for a second but as she explained herself more, it turns out she still wants to keep everything the same. This includes the affection, late night chats, and physical intimacy as well.


I thought she wanted just a less serious relationship but she was adamant on not calling it a relationship at all, preferring to use best friends.


So, as icing on the cake, I said I'd finally be able to change my Facebook profile picture (which is one of us together) to a different picture of myself I liked. She became sad when I said I would be changing it.


At this point, I'm more confused than anything. I don't understand what she wants or what she gets by breaking up but not changing how we interact with each other.

12363,Breakups,3cd4ta,"So I met this girl weirdly on Instagram. Well, I always knew who she was in high school and a had a huge crush on her but never spoke to her. Long story short she commented on my picture and I sent her a DM to talk.

We started hanging out. The first time we hung out at a beach until like 4 AM just talking. Then the next day we drove to a far City for the food, but it was just to spend time with each other. That night she was really flirty and I instantly fell for her. HOWEVER, she was dating a guy for 2 years. Long story short they were on horrible terms and the relationship was bound to end. So the next day we went and got lunch and she uses an excuse to come take a nap at my place. We kiss, cuddle, yada yada, it's great.

This is where it gets tricky. I know it's too soon to date her since she basically broke up with her BF for me. So I try to take it slow, but it takes off. We are spending the night with each other, having sex, hanging out every day. Eventually she tells me she's not ready for a BF and she just needs to be single. I was okay with it. But then she came back a week later and we hit it off once again.

Jumping two months ahead, we're talking still, but not official. I can tell things are off. We both ended up going to this weekend music festival. On Friday she get really drunk and I saw some other dude kiss her. I figured whatever we aren't dating. But that night she finds me and tells me how much she wants me and no one else and she wants to be exclusive. We have a great time Saturday and get back Sunday and spend all day in bed together.

Skip ahead two days, she's my girlfriend and she told me she loved me and wanted to marry me someday. Me thinking I want the same tell her it back. So things are PERFECT .Her family loves me, all of her friends love me, nothing can go wrong.

Then Sunday we wake up and somethings off. We were supposed to hang out that day but she makes up an excuse saying her sister is in the hospital. TLDR her sister wasn't and she lied. Then she went up North to hang out with some friends that day. She gets back and I meet her at her house and things are just off. Really off. She wont say a word to me. I think she cheated on me but doesn't have the guts to tell me because she hates being the bad guy.

So this morning I wake up to a text of her telling me she can't do this anymore and she wants me to leave her alone and I deserve better and she wants me to move on. Mind you everything was perfect. Now she's texting me telling me there's just too much going on in her life and she can't be with me right now.

We have a lot of similar interests and passions, similar life aspirations and enjoy going out together. We've had a lot of arguments whilst we've been together, ranging anywhere from keeping secrets to one of us not being hungry when the other is... very silly sometimes. 


However, when everything is good its GREAT. We make each other cry with laughter, we can just cuddle for hours and the sex is awesome!


I do enjoy our sex, it leaves me very satisfied and i've never been disappointed but sometimes I feels more like I'm in a porno than having sex with my boyfriend? He isnt into BDSM or anything out there, but he loves being dominant and saying dirty things to me. He constantly encourages me to say dirty things but I make myself cringe! He uses phrases like balls deep and it makes me want to laugh but he stays 100% serious when we're having sex.


Where as I can come quite quickly, it seems like he holds off and we often last around 40 minutes. Great, right? meh... it hurts after about 30 minutes and in the end we're both really sweaty.


I've often asked why dont we just make love and do something gentle? rather than ball slapping and light strangling but he laughs it off like i'm joking and then turns back into Tom the Pornstar, it's like he just changes character and nothing can distract him from his one true goal: hammering my vagina. 


He seriously is a very lovely guy and if I ask him not to do something (like touch my nipple because my piercing is sore) he'll immediately make sure he's not hurting me. But I sometimes wish we could just have a fun quickie where we can laugh at eachother and not feel like there's a camera on me...


I really don't know how to tell him without completely bruising his sexual ego. He always compliments how amazing we are together but if I'm ever not in the mood to have crazy sex for nearly an hour, it feels like we can't do anything else... so I'll just say I'm tired and he'll say he's frustrated and be a bit off with me like I'm not attracted to him.


I mean when I'm up for it, great! and it is great! But it feels like a lot more effort for me than him, I'm the one with messed up hair, sweaty make-up and 'dripping' afterwards so I spend an hour afterwards cleaning myself up.

12366,Breakups,3dt6pj,"Hey guys,


So this is probably a regular ordeal especially around here, but I just need someone to talk to so I stop being so hard on myself.


I very recently broke up with my girlfriend of 1.5 years because of the changes I saw in her and how it affected our potential future. It all started out great and we complimented each other perfectly as a couple. But as time went on I noticed her starting to care less about me/us and it was showing in the way I was being treated. 


Tldr of the problems/changes that happened: she became more irratable, especially around my family, she started trying to bring me down, especially when I had good news to share about me, and she was also starting to show signs of things that were going on behind my back (things that she knew I would disapprove of like smoking and drinking, etc.)


So after talking to her about these things and how I noticed her significant personality changes, i decided it was time to end the relationship based on her reaction to the conversation we had..lets just say it didn't go to well when I said you've been changing and it's hurting me. I loved her to death as I always had but I couldn't take anymore of this battling trying to get her old self back that I initially fell in love with.


So fast forward a week or so after the breakup--which went surprisingly better than I expected--and I'm the one taking a hit. I ended things because I was getting so hurt so consistently from her and I guess I expected her to be a bit more...understanding..? of my reasoning in doing so. But right now, I can't help but feel that I'm being made out to be the bad guy.


We agreed to keep the breakup kind of private--I.e. no posting on social media and whatnot, but that agreement was quickly broken and not on my end. Her/our friends are quickly unfollowing me on social media which makes me think that they think I'm the one to blame. I also saw something that very much led me to believe that she was already hanging out with another guy..


So I guess we get to my question and need for discussion. Is this normal? I felt terrible having to end our 1.5yr relationship but I left letting her know that I still love her and want to be a part of her life somehow and she told me she felt the same way. Why is it that barely a week later she seems to have moved on so quickly when she initially seemed so devastated? Why am I feeling so guilty for leaving a relationship that kept hurting me? I need closure and I need to talk about this.. I don't really have anybody else that I'm willing to go into such detail with.


tl;dr: broke up with girlfriend of 1.5yrs because I was getting hurt as a result of her changing dramatically for the worse--and I couldn't do anything about it even after talking to her about it. Soon after breakup, I feel extreme guilt because her actions lead me to believe/feel like everything was my fault. Help :( I feel aweful and need some sort of closure

12375,Dating,2h5qh6,"I met a cute guy at a party through a mutual friend, and we hit it off really well. I was interested in getting to know him more, but didn't want to ask our friend to play matchmaker because I'm fully capable of asking him out myself and I know it can be awkward for a friend to play matchmaker when they're not sure if both parties are interested. So I figured I'd forget about the cute guy, and should we end up hanging out again with our mutual friend together, I'd ask for his number and if he wanted to get a drink or something.

Lo and behold, shortly after meeting, we matched each other on Tinder. That provided a great gateway to start talking and getting to know each other better. Hung out with him a couple of times, and I had a really fun time each time. At the time, I really thought he did as well. He hasn't asked me out since, and between that and his now-boring texts, I get the feeling he's not interested. Totally fine. Although I figure he must find me attractive on some level (since we matched on Tinder and went out multiple times), I know that sometimes sparks just don't fly. I'm cool with that.

Here's the problem though. We got along and have so many similar viewpoints that really matter to me in not only relationships, but friendships as well, and we have a ton of the same interests. I'm not at all bitter about his (apparent?) unwillingness to pursue me further, but I'm in a sticky situation because I would really like to be his friend. I don't know how to go about that though, because if we had've been friends from the get go, I would have just said Let's agree to just stay friends. Likewise, if he were just a random guy that I didn't mesh with, I'd just chalk it up as a loss and we'd go our separate ways.

However, since we have so much in common I'd love to hang out with him more, but legitimately as platonic friends. How can I suggest hanging out (there's a specific, totally nonromantic idea that I have in mind) without seeming like I'm desperately clinging for him to continue dating me? I have no idea how common of a situation this is, but even if the circumstances had been different and I wasn't attracted to him from the get go, I know I would have pursued a friendship with him.

Might lose a girlfriend!  Boo!

So, I don't really know where to begin here.  She wants to move in.  I'm not ready.  If we don't move in, she'll leave me.  I don't want her to leave me.  For her not to leave me, we need to move in.  But I'm not ready.... etc etc.  She's (understandably) frustrated with a relationship that isn't moving forward.

There's a few reasons why I'm not ready.  A lot of it she says is excuse making, which, I honestly don't know if that's true or not.  A few reasons why I'm not ready...

-Cleanliness.  This is pretty important.  I'm not the most clean person.  She's less clean than I am.  I feel like I spend a lot of time picking up after her, whether its trash or dishes or dirty clothes.  I'm a mess, but my mess is about all I can handle.  She's made an effort to pick up after herself, but, sometimes, its just too much.

-Stress.  Everything is always a challenge.  Everything is stressful and a problem.  We'll fight over stupid stuff.  We get over it really quick, but still.  It can be draining.

-Independence.  I spend most of my time with her, yes.  But I can go home, or do what I want any time.  I feel like I'll lose this option.  Or even my self identity if that makes sense.

-Her dedication to things:  Sometimes I wonder if she'll just get lazy in life and quit.  It could be anything.  She's quit on things before, but that's because she was focusing more on other, more important things (like her degree), but still.  She doesn't follow through with everything.

-Its a big f-ing deal.  Its practically marriage.  In fact, from my perspective, it IS marriage.  I'm 28, but I'm not ready to be married.

-Grass is greener.  Sometimes I think, maybe there's something better out there.  I haven't met it, or even given the possibility a chance, and it makes me wonder.

But on the other hand.  I do want to be with her.  I think about the what-ifs of someone else, but I can't picture anyone but her.  I do love her.  I just don't know if I'm ready to handle this kind of commitment.  But I don't want us to break up.  She's really an amazing person with great qualities.  I'm comfortable with her, I can talk to her, I don't mind her family, she's genuinely fun to be with.

Another concern I have is... maybe I'm just scared of being alone?  I haven't been single in a long time. Sometimes when I think of the prospect of us breaking up, I think gosh I love her, I don't want to lose her, but less often other times I think if she leaves me, I'll have no one.  I know this might make me an asshole, but its something that's gone through my mind.  I don't know.  REDDIT! HALP!

About three weeks ago my girlfriend (K) her mother (S) and her brother (J) took a little vacation to Hawaii. I was staying at the house with the stepfather (C) because I had been working with him. So for the first four days everything was good. We were almost done with our first job, about to start another. One night after work, it's Saturday and Anderson Silva is fighting. 

I am in my room watching the fight. C bursts into my room, repeatedly screaming who is involved. Now let me backtrack a little. C has this suspicion that people are watching him. He can find any website online and find a way to convince himself that they are following him. Now this time was different. He was constantly rubbing his nose and twitching. I had found coke in his truck before so I immediately knew he was on it. Once I saw how aggressive he was I got my car keys and left. C has multiple guns and is unstable. So I stay at a friends house for a few days. Come to find out C just gets worse. He completely destroys the house. Ripping ceiling fans from the roof and tipping things over. So it turns out C gets arrested for walkin around the neighborhood with a loaded handgun mumbling to himself. He is held in a county psyche ward to see if he comes down from his drug induced paranoia. After about 3 days he is release back in to society. 

Right out of the psyche ward he is already unstable. Repeatedly calling his wife S to tell her that she is a spy and that I am an FBI agent whose main purpose is to spy on him. So he sits in his house for another week just breaking things. I might add, he completely destroyed mine and K's room. He destroyed my iMac as well as broke my 36 inch Led tv. He ends up getting 5150 because of his crazy behavior. They take him straight to the psyche ward because they had seen him before. Turns out the authorities let him out in under 2 hours because it was a drug problem not a mental issue. 

Cut to the present day, I texted him letting him know that I expect him to pay me back for the things he has broken. He texts me back...he told me that I am next. He is going to come after me her said. He told me to watch my back. He also said that he was going to destroy my car. I am no lawyer. I don't know what I can do in this situation.

12378,Dating,2la0ik,"So, I met this girl (we'll call her Melody) online. She lived a good distance from me (about a two hour drive, one way). We emailed, we texted, we talked on the phone for hours on end. I was really interested in her, and she seemed to be really interested in me. We finally agreed to meet for dinner. We got there around the same time, had a couple of drinks and ordered dinner. The conversation was just as great as it was on the phone. We lingered over dessert and kept talking. Finally she invited me back to her place to meet her kids.  I thought it was a little strange to be meeting the kids (and her sister, who was babysitting) on the first date.  But I thought, what the heck.. I liked her and wanted to spend more time with her.

I followed her to a gas station where we stopped to pick up some beer and then I followed her to her house. When we got there, her kids (9 and 11) and her sister were watching TV. Sister left shortly after we got there and the kids were excited to meet someone new. While Melody put the beer in the fridge and went to freshen up, the kids showed me their rooms and asked me a bunch of questions.  Then Melody and I cracked open some beers and played some board game with the kids.  As it got later, the kids were sent off to bed and Melody invited me to stay. So, I did. I was a little hesitant at first with the kids just across the hall. The sex was pretty good. It was not my best performance, but we both went to sleep happy.

The next morning when I woke up, she was already awake and so were the kids. I ran some water over my face and cleaned myself up as best as I could. When I went out to the kitchen where everyone was, Melody was pretty quiet and the kids had questions again. (Like: Where did you sleep last night? Uh.... on the floor...). Sister arrived a few minutes later (I think she lived down the street).  She and Melody had plans for the day. It was obvious that I should go, so I did.

Over the next couple of weeks, we talked on the phone and texted, but not as much. It seemed like she didn't put much effort in continuing to talk, so I just let it go. Eventually we stopped altogether. Never really spoke about that night again. So, I'm left wondering... what the hell happened?

12379,Breakups,22wjdk,"My girlfriend broke up with me a 6 months ago. She was my first and I haven't seen anyone else since then. I'm a dorky geek. It still hurts a lot. 

My girlfriend broke up with me saying she had this illness, fibromylagia. It was really weird. But we were so happy together and I don't know what happened. It just ended just like that. She told me to let her go. She blocked me.

She told me to leave her alone. That hurt a lot. She said I did nothing wrong. What went wrong? I just wish I knew what happened.

My question is, do you need to know what happened? Do you need to know in order to get closure? I'm guessing no, but does it help? I wish she broke up with me because I was too needy or something. Not because of an illness. Did she lie? Questions like that I think about. It hurts so much sometimes. I'm just so damn curious about what the fuck went wrong, you know? I want to know what happened. I feel like I need to know. I was so happy with her, how could this have happened? 

But then like, just move on. I know. That's what you are supposed to do. I will eventually, find another gal and be happy again I guess. But I feel like I will forever wonder about this woman. Like, what exactly happened. I feel like snooping, but that is fucked up. That's called stalking, and gentleman don't do that shit.

I actually went around asking her friends on facebook, and she contacted me telling me to stop. And told me she wished me well but to leave her alone. Why? I thought she loved me, what went wrong? What did I do wrong? She won't say, and I hate thinking because she is sick. I just want to know and get closure so badly.

But I'm guessing...that is just how life works sometimes? Right?

12380,Relationships,2ulnni,"So I have a pretty bad track record when it comes to mental health.  I will do my best to be fair to both of myself and my wife in this.


I have always put my mental health as a low priority. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, and instead of taking care of myself, I let myself wither down and become depressed. When this happens, I view things negatively and talk about things negatively. My wife tells me that it tears her a part when she watches me be so great to seeing me in pain and she's powerless to stop it.  Why?  Because I don't listen to her. I tell her that I will get back in to counseling.  I tell her that I will start exercising to help myself but I don't (at least not right away).


The reason I am writing this post is for our fight tonight.  I did something I shouldn't have done and I freely admit it.  To make a long story short, I messed around and when told to stop, I made a comment that I shouldn't have (pointing out something childish) and set my wife off.  The problem is, this opened the flood gates.  Earlier in the night, I snapped at my wife because I was frustrated at an automated call system that sent me to the wrong department and after calling back 2 additional times, hung up on me.  However, when something frustrates her, she can snap at me and have a valid excuse.  I will admit that her excuse is better than anything I could have come up with because it wasn't her fault that an automated phone system messed up on me.


To continue, once the floodgates opened, there was a lot of talk about how I don't see from her point of view.  There was a lot of talk about how she has heard the same old story that I give--in this case though, I have counseling appointments scheduled out indefinitely and I have cleaned the kitchen 2 of the last 3 nights (this is a huge gripe of hers) and I was going to do it tonight as well.  However, she wants to dwell on the past (and I understand why) so I told her to not bring that up as I am trying to dust my hands off and get better for us to make her happy.  She told me that she is happy and that I wasn't listening.  She wants me to be a partner with her, not make her happy.


Finally, she tells me that the way I'm cleaning the kitchen pisses her off. I tell her that she needs to be brutally honest so that she can get this out of her system and I can move on; so she does.  She tells me she is sick of being helpless watching me wither away, lie to her parents, lie to her coworkers that something is wrong and that her job performance is slipping because she cannot hold the relationship together. I didn't say a word, I let her get all of it out.  She used phrases such as this is killing me piece by piece every time and this is killing us and I'm so unhappy (remember when she said she was happy?).


When all was said and done, I told her I needed time to myself.  This was my doing and I let her vent... now I needed to calm myself and say: Let me relax, regroup, and we will discuss it further. But she demands why.  I told her I wanted to meditate and unwind after all of that.  She asks why I cannot do that upstairs with her and I tell her because I would rather be alone.  She then says that it's unfair that I can get alone time (since we have a son) and that this better be the last time I do it.  So reddit... here's my question:


Why do I want to break and throw everything I own?  Why do I hate myself so much right now? Why can I not have some space to unwind and come to terms that I cannot make my wife satisfied?  I know my past but I am done dwelling on it.  I am actively trying to fix it by being proactive but that's all I want to do now is cry and throw things and break things until I can do no more because this was all of my fault to begin with.... yet how am I supposed to feel when I have been told that I'm killing my family?  How am I supposed to feel when I'm told I am killing my relationship?  How am I supposed to feel when I'm told that my problems are hurting my wife's job?  Should I feel happy?  Should I roll over and play dead?  Should I throw things?  At this point, I called a crisis line to vent a bit but I can't vent to them forever. I come to you guys for help because I have started the counseling, I have cleaned the kitchen the past 2 nights to get caught up from when I got rear ended 2 weeks ago and had to not touch it for a week and a half.  I am now sitting in my office alone with an aching stomach, a tight chest, a headache, and my mind is rushing with a ton of anxiety. Particularly because I feel like I was just used as an emotional punching bag.

We've been together for about 2 years and have a great relationship. We see each other almost everyday, have great sex, communicate well (except for this problem), etc. We don't live together but have talked about it and the plan is to marry in several years. 

On to the problem...Several times when we've been sleeping over with each other he has woken me up with a scream from a dead sleep. He will shoot straight up while screaming and it wakes us both. At this point he will be breathing heavily and sweating profusely. I do my best to calm him but he is resistant for help. He feels this situation makes him weak. He won't tell me what the dream was about that made him do that. I don't push when he says he doesn't want to talk about. He has said he doesn't remember, however I don't believe that just based on his mannerisms. He usually doesn't fall back to sleep easily after these episodes. He also has a problem with sleep walking and talking in his sleep. One time he began thrashing and accidentally elbowed me. It seemed like he was fighting off someone? When I told him he apologized for hurting me. I was more worried about him. 

When I bring these problems up he gets very defensive and shuts down. He doesn't wanna talk about it. And he doesn't think its a problem since he's dealt with it for so many years at this point. I've told him I think he needs therapy and he believes it's for the weak minded, not manly types of things. When I've proved to see what the problem might be he immediately seemed more aggressive saying he didn't wanna talk about it. The only thing I've been able to get out of him is that something bad happened to him as a child and nobody knows. He believes his mother may know about this incident but it's never been spoken of.  

He comes from a very poor, but loving/caring family. Parents are still together and have a good marriage. They had some tough times when he was small and often took in other, sometimes shady family members who were down on their luck as well. His mother adores him and he gets along great with his dad. 

What do I do? How can I help him? I'm afraid push the topic because of his attitude towards it. But it interrupts his sleep and obviously messes with him psychologically. He won't get help for whatever this issue is. But I feel so helpless. And I feel a little scared. He's very strong, if he were to become violent in his sleep while I'm there I might get hurt.

12382,Dating,1zrit1,"So here is the situation.
There is this girl that lives in my dorm. I really like her (I mean REALLY like her, maybe almost in love, the fuck do I know), I think she is very beautiful and has a nice personality.

So I have been gathering my courage for quite a while and finally, after a few weeks, I told her I liked her (I didn't like her like that at the start, but after about 2-3 months,something just clicked in my head, I don't know how to explain it). She told me that she is in love with someone else, but that that person does not love her back and that she is not seeking any other relationships at this moment. She also said that she doesn't want to have anything to do with me except a friendship.

Thats ok (well, I'm quite heartbroken to be honest), a classic friendzone/rejection, I can accept that, been there, done that.
But the problem is, that everyone at this dorm (about 10-15 people) always hang out together including me. Upon recieveng this rejection, I have noticed that she has started acting differently when we hang out. In a sense that she is very very clearly hitting on other guys in the group right in front of me (note that this has started happening 2 days after I told her I liked her). Things like sitting in other guys laps (2 other guys, lets call them dude 1 and dude 2), stroking their hair, sitting VERY close to them, ignoring me while talking to everyone else (especially these two other dudes) etc.

She seemed like a nice person, very honest and kind, highly energretic (exactly the kind of girl I ALWAYS fall for) and I believed her that she doesn't want to have anything to do with any other guy. I don't really have anything against her seeing other dudes, it shouldn't really bother me, but I really think she is doing all of this out of proportion and on purpose just to fuck with me. I also think she isn't really in love with someone else, she just said that. I really like this group of people, I love hanging out with them, but seeing her acting like this just hurts me right in the heart.

Additionaly, I also know that she has been sleeping with another guy from our group (dude 1) , and I'm 95% sure that she has been sleeping with a third guy (dude 3) from this group as well, but nothing serious.
She was also hitting on me one night, but I didn't think much of it at the time (classic signs, sitting in my lap, licking nuttella of my finger, standing close to me etc.) I know I'm stupid.

Despite all of this, I still like her very very much, but she continues to fuck with me like this (she didn't do this before). So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, how do I handle this? I really like this group of people, I like hanging out with them, but this constant torture is begining to really lay heavily upon my shoulders, and I don't want to stop hanging out with these people (because when push comes to shove, they are good people), but at the same time, I don't think I can handle this for much longer. So should I just stop hanging out with these people? Should I seek revenge and fuck with her back? Why is she doing this? How should I handle this situtation? Any advice, suggestions and help would be greatly appreciated. Please help, this is destroying me.
Disclaimer: I know she has a right to be with anyone she damn pleases, but now she knows I like her, and she has all the power, and she uses this in such a manner to hurt me on an emotional level. This is definetly a mistake I will never make again.

12383,Breakups,2epdkt,"Meet my ex back in high school, but lost touch over the years. Ran into each other at a mutual friend's wedding and started dating not long after. Everything was fine, we got along well, had fun together, etc.

For the first two months, we did the whole trying to impress each other thing, so we were both on our best behavior. That starts to fade, cause we get to be more comfortable around each other (she's still on best behavior, I'm not so much). I'm a guy - I like gross humor, she's got a good sense of humor, but she's not so into the gross humor. She tolerates it (she has three brothers so she's kind of used to it), but I guess everyone has their limits.

I'm super comfortable around her, so I start making crude jokes, passing gas, announcing my bowel movements, belching, etc. basically acting like I do around my roommates. This gets lots of eye rolls from her and she does ask me to tone it down. I thought it was funny. She doesn't seem as interested in having sex and I start to feel like she's just annoyed by me.

She came over Saturday night and we were on the couch watching a movie. She was laying down, with her head basically in my lap, my hand was on her stomach. When the movie ended, she turned so she was on her back looking up at me. I don't know why, but I started pressing down on her stomach with my hand. She asked me what I was doing and I told her I was trying to make her fart. She rolled her eyes and asked me to stop. Because I'm an idiot, I kept pressing and told her to relax. She asked me to stop again, I didn't. Then, she forced my hand off of her belly, stood up and basically told me off. She was pissed. She told me that I was hurting her, grossing her out and that it just wasn't working and we were done. I haven't spoken to her since.

I get that I annoyed her and why. I know I need to tone down the gross humor. I doubt that she's going to reach out to me. She's an awesome lady and I really want to be with her. I can change, but I don't know if she'll give me another chance. Should I just let her walk away or try to convince her that my eyes have been opened to how dumb and gross I was?

12384,Breakups,1w7hgw,"A little background first... We were together for three months when out of the blue, he ended things because he had doubts. He was happy when we were physically together but after being apart for a few days, his mind would overwork and he'd begin to doubt our relationship. After a week apart we met up to chat and ended up resolving our relationship because I told him it was too soon to be panicking about these things and we were otherwise very happy. 

So over a year passed....a very happy year with no mention of any more doubts. Sometimes I'd jokingly bring up the break-up and I could see he felt bad about it and regretted it, said it was a massive mistake. So I was pretty secure in our relationship.

I knew I loved him... I'm the type that falls hard and fast. Every now and again it would bother me that the L word hadn't been said but I thought as long as he shows me affection and treats me great, I can wait. It takes people time to say those words and as far as I was aware he had never said it before. He isn't one for talking about emotions and I knew this was just how he was. We saw each other numerous times a week, travelling 40 mins via car regularly as we live a bit away from each other. We always made time for each other, and when we argued I was a safe in the knowledge that we'd always resolve things.

Out of the blue on Tuesday evening, in amongst our usual texting he asked if we could skip dinner on Wednesday night and just go for a coffee and have a chat, because there was something we needed to discuss. I panicked and rang him. He wouldn't say what the issue was over the phone but eventually I got it out of him. I knew I couldn't wait 24 hours to find out what was going on. He wanted to talk about the elephant in the room ie the fact we had not said the L word yet. In summary, he ended up telling me how in his previous relationship, he told his girlfriend he loved her after 4 months but later realised he didn't and took it back, leaving this girl heartbroken. I was completely unaware this had happened. He was afraid of ever doing this again. We agreed to meet up on Wednesday night but I knew his mind was already made up.

So Wednesday came and it brought 2 hours of tears and hugs. He said he was having those doubts again. I asked if he was happy and he said he really was, but is that enough? I tried to explain how doubts are normal every now and again as long as they eventually go away. But I know he is an overanalyser and he couldn't get this out of his head, that it wasn't right. In my opinion, we are so well suited and perfect for each other. He even ended up crying about how he wasn't at the love stage yet and was worried he'd never feel that way about anyone, let alone me. I told him it's different for everyone and that he should give us a chance, I'll work through any issues with him. I don't need to hear those words yet, we're still quite young. But he's afraid of just doing this again another year down the road.

I am absolutely heartbroken. I thought he was the one, I thought he was it! This came out of nowhere, we had been communicating and hanging out as normal. He said he didn't plan to break up, just discuss the issue with me, but after he saw how upset I got it's the right thing to do. I wanted us to try and work through this because there is still so much there.

Ever since he has text me everyday, and we are texting with the same frequency as we did when together, but obviously with different content ie no bf/gf stuff. I asked him if he thought this was unusual and he said he supposes it is but he'd find it hard to just stop talking to me. And I don't want to stop either. I tried to bring us up a few times but he says he doesn't know what he wants and doesn't want to talk about it. He was even on a night out with his friends last night but continued to text me. 

I feel so confused... I feel like if I stop talking to him he'll forget about me and we'll never resolve us. It's breaking my heart and I really need some advice.

We dated for 8 months in SA and, when I had to go back to my home country (UK), she came with me on a temporary visa, suspending her studies for over a year.

**Good**


* Our history (shared jokes, memories)


* I can talk to her about anything (although we often disagree about politics)


* I like her family and friends


* I think she is good looking


* She makes me laugh and is very sweet


* My family like her


* She is open sexually and we share fantasies openly - being with her has made me a lot more sexually comfortable


* She accepts me and says she finds me attractive even though I have put on weight


* I do love her and don't want to hurt her


* We share quite a lot in terms of values (neither of us is religious; we have similar politics)


**Bad**


* She is insecure and needs constant reassurance about our relationship (literally every day), thinks I'm going to dump her (ironically this has pushed me away from her...)


* When she drinks she is irrational, paranoid and bitter, will have hysterics and accuse me of all sorts of bad things to the point where I do not recognise her


* She lives on the other side of the world and if she comes to live with me it will be a cause of strain in our relationship because she has given up so much for me (she has stated as much before)


* She frequently turns in on herself, isn't motivated, will spend all day in bed with the curtains closed (this is due to depression; she is seeing a counsellor after I asked her to)


* I no longer find her very sexually appealing, although I think she is good looking. I find it embarrassing when she tries to seduce me. However this may be my own problem due to anxiety killing my libido sometimes.


* Being with her will involve at least another year of long distance

After numerous attempts of reaching out to him, I emailed his law school email, which I know he checks frequently and attached a read receipt. He responded and broke up with me because he kept thinking about his ex and thinks that if we were to go forward, it would be based off what happened instead of what could happen. He also said he was leading me on and only using me for sex to get over his ex. 

While I didn't know if he was THE ONE (do those even exist? Or are they like unicorns and we use them to feel better about ourselves?), I did enjoy spending time with him and I can't believe he used an EMAIL to break up with me. What is this, 2002?

I love my life with him, but things sexually have been really difficult recently...When this started, about a year and a half ago, I just lost my sex drive.  I didn't have any urges to have sex with anyone else until about a month ago, I didn't feel less attractive to him, I really don't know what initially made me lose my sex drive.


I thought I had a handle on my urges for an ex fling of mine until a dream I had last night made me realize how desperate I feel to have sex with my ex.  I don't want to go through with it, but I literally cry thinking about how I will never get to be with him again.  We knew each other about 6 1/2 years ago and were friends for about a month ending a short while after we had sex one time.  I have had feelings for this guy ever since, but it didn't keep me from dating other people.  This is just recently resurfaced, my desires for him again, like I said within the last month, however it's only for sex without wanting a relationship.  We are still friends and talk on facebook, meeting up randomly with friends occasionally, but he's not in my life a lot.  My S/O has no idea about my desires for him and I feel that if I were to try to explain to him how I felt it would destroy him...I want to just forget about all of this but I just can't let it go.

I'm not texting, calling, or pursuing it at all but the fact that I feel so desperate for him is effecting the healing process of my loss of sex drive for my S/O and I don't want anything but to fix things with my fiance.

Okay, so this past April I was very confused about my relationship. There were little things about my then partner that were eating at me little by little and it got to the point that I couldn't see past those things anymore. I think that because of this, I started lashing out at him in passive aggressive ways. One night I said some really hurtful things to him. I think about it today and I don't know what the fuck I was thinking. I wasn't thinking. 

Anyway, I realized what I'd done that night and I apologized and we were fine. But my friends could see that I wasn't completely happy and so they encouraged me to end things with him. When he and I talked about it, he told me we could fix things, that he wanted to stay together. He was really sweet and told me things he would've done differently with me. 

Deep down I knew we could fix it. If I could just let go of my own prejudices and start anew, things would've been fine. But instead I chose to end things then and there. I was convinced that I needed to be apart from him for a while, maybe forever. I thought I could figure things out and then regroup.


The week after the break up was really rough. But this was at the end of the school year, so as things were winding down I got drunk a lot and smoked a lot to numb my emotions and thus I began to believe I was actually fine.


I go to school 8 hours from my home. I ended up going home for the summer. For the first month, basically all of May, I continued to feel fine about everything. I tried talking to other people. That was fun for a while. But there was always something missing that had never been missing with my ex. He's just so much more interesting to me and he knew me so well. Everything reminds me of him and I want to talk to him about so many things around me.


About two days ago, I asked him if there was any hope for us getting back together and he told me he wasn't interested anymore. That he wants to look for what we had somewhere else. At first I resigned myself to this fate. I love and care about him, so I told myself that if that's how he's going to be happiest, then so be it. 

But then I started to think, who gives up on love? I honestly believe what we had was real. I'd never ever felt that I could spend the rest of my life with anyone until I met him. I want to fix my mistake and show him that I can do way better, but I'm afraid I've hurt him too much and that it's too late to reach him now.


Have any of you been thru this? I really just need some support. Any questions just ask.

He sometimes laughs at me for not knowing things and says 'do you live under a cave?' I always feel so embarrassed I don't know things - he makes me feel stupid. And honestly I never feel like that with anybody else. But with him I feel so thick and I actually do think I am stupid. Hes really into fashion. Sometimes I see certain girls and I can't help but think 'thats the perfect girl for him.' Girls like that he thinks are 'cool.' He would be able to talk about the things I know nothing about. I find it hard to act interested and be chatty when he talks about these things - not because I'm not interested because I actually am, but more because I'm embarrassed I don't know anything about it. 

I find myself getting jealous of anybody that he thinks is 'cool' because I know he sees in those people something he doesn't see in me. I get jealous of him liking anybody a lot, especially if its a girl. I know I'm being irrational but I can't control the way it makes me feel. 

I'm scared hes only with me because he thinks I'm good looking and hes not the best looking guy. Sometimes I wander, is he only with me because he can't get anyone else? His last girlfriend was quite goodlooking and hes always said hes never had a problem getting girls. 

He says its not the only reason hes with me and hes told me countless reasons why he loves me. But I just find it hard to believe when I'm certain he thinks I'm stupid and not cool.

He's pretty obsessed with 'being cool' and it seems like the most important thing to him. This is why I just cannot understand why on earth he would want to be with me. I feel like I am not good at anything and being with him makes that feeling even worse. I guess its because when you're with someone you want to try and impress them. But there is absolutely nothing about me that is impressive. 

I have spoken about this to him. I told him he makes me feel stupid and I don't understand why hes with me. He just tells me I'm being ridiculous and that I know all the reasons hes with me. We share no mutual friends so I have absolutely no idea how he is around other people. I have no idea if hes flirty with other girls - but hes a guy so I guess he is. He says he doesn't care about other girls, but I find this hard to believe. He gets really upset if I even speak to a guy - and most of my friends are boys so this happens a lot. He goes through my phone a lot, and this makes me really angry.

He sometimes tells me stories about girls he used to fancy and it gets me so angry. Even just thinking about it gets me angry. I've never really fancied anyone before or like anyone a lot. I feel like I'm just a replacement for all of these girls he fancied but couldn't get with. He talks about chatting up girls when he was younger and this makes me feel rubbish. When he tells me these things I see him as a girl thirsty dog and feel like he only settled for me but I'm not what he really wants.

I've always lived a very late sleeping pattern. If I have a choice, such as at weekends, **I'll stay up till at least 3am, often later. On normal work days it's about 1am**. I aim for 8 hours' sleep, so I have equivalent waking up times.

My GF has one at the opposite end: on days off **she's up at 7am, and goes to bed for 11pm**. I know this isn't *especially* extreme, but the problem is that **she starts getting tired at 8pm**, and it has sometimes been earlier than this.

Note that I'm not saying either of our patterns are *wrong* - they're just conflicting. And **I'm fully aware that the obvious answer is 'compromise'**, where I shift a couple of hours earlier and/or she shifts a couple of hours ahead. To some extent I do do this: I've been getting up early (by my standard) on weekends at 10 or 11am to go and meet her.

The problem this causes is obvious: I'll come from work and pick her up at 6pm, which means that **we basically have 2 hours before she starts letting me know she's tired and is simply not inclined to enagage at all**. Even on weekends, if we go out during the day it's the same story: when we have time just sat at my house, it's incredibly short lived.

A couple of considerations: it does only seem to be at mine that she expresses this, which is when we have time alone together. At her house she can be up till 10:30 and not really have a problem. Another point is that there are benefits to this: I still have a good amount of time afterwards to pursue my own interests too.

Obviously we do get on really well together, and I wouldn't have such a debate with this if I didn't think there were enough qualities in her to battle this one with myself. **It just makes it *incredibly* hard for me when I just can't expect her to be up having any time to spend with me during evenings**. I just don't feel like I get to spend any quality time with her, and also makes me feel like she's not motivated enough to power through the tiredness (in reality I know this is fallacious).

I know a lot of people will say that a pattern of 7am-11pm isn't particularly extreme. I know this, and that's not my issue. It's that hers and mine are incompatible, especially when it's 8pm when she gets too tired to enagage.

My first relationship began before my freshman year of highschool. We started dating 3 days after we met, and we didn't get very far. Lets call the girl P. Her 3 close friends didn't care for me(for reasons still unknown), and things just kind of crumbled, and P didn't talk to me until mid junior year. She had a boyfriend at the time, and I wasn't at a time to be dating, so I didn't feel anything towards her. 

I started dating my current girlfriend J, right when my senior year of high school started. We have a pretty good relationship I think, and get closer all the time. J was somewhat friends with P, and she knew that I had dated her, and it wasn't an issue. 

Well, like it happens to all high school relationships, college comes around, and we decided that we wanted to do long distance. We both wanted to stay together and try for a LDR, but I was less confident than she was. 
She left for college, along with most of my friends did, a a few weeks earlier than I did, and I was left at home, lonely and bored. (you know where this is going.....)

I went to hang out with friends still at home, and as people started leaving, it ended up just being P and I alone. We ended up in my car, purely talking. We got along pretty well, and were open with eachother and I ended up saying something along the lines of I know it's bad, but I have this really strong desire to just kiss you when I'm with you.
She told me the feeling was mutual, and we talked about that, both agreeing that we weren't going to do anything regardless of the mutual feeling. 
We hung out a few more times that week, each time we would both mention something about the feelings, but then the other person would talk the other person out of it.

On the last time we hung out, I realized that I really didn't want to do anything, and I told her that I wanted to leave. She didn't take too kindly to that, but I left and nothing has come of it since. We still talk occasionally on facebook, but I can say for myself that I have no intention of ever doing that again. 

Now, I don't know what to do. I love J with every inch of my body and I want to marry and have a family with her. She's the absolute love of my life. 

I want to tell her, but she's pretty emotional, and has jealousy issues. I'm afraid for how she is going to react and what she will say. She's already mentioned that she had thoughts of suicide last year before school started.

Over the last year, I was living with my parents and only worked part-time while I applied for better/ more suitable jobs, so it's not as if I was high-flying myself. However, I am making plans for my future and as I couldn't get a job in the field I graduated in, I have gone back to University for a masters (this should help a lot) and when I complete my studies I should hopefully be on a good career path.

I worry about our future, as I don't see him making any progress towards supporting himself or us. Every time he thinks about applying for jobs he has a burst of motivation and then realises he has nothing on his CV and is in mid twenties, gets depressed and anxious (these are things he has struggled with) and gives up to make those feelings go away.

 Compounding this is the fact he's from a successful family so the idea of being rejected from 'ordinary' or low-level jobs is, I think, humiliating for him when even having those jobs could probably be seen as a failure compared to the rest of his family. If I try and bring these topics up with him, he gets very upset and will often turn to junk food and/or alcohol (he's started to put on weight, and whilst he's still basically a slim person, it's not a good start and I worry his current situation his hampering his motivation to excercise and eat right).

5 years ago I moved out of my parents house and start to get serious about losing weight. I lost loads of weight and it was great. I live on my own now.

I got with my boyfriend then, at my smallest which was 2 years ago.

Our relationship is fantastic, he's fantastic, I'm very much in love and he says the same about me. He has always said how gorgeous I am, and says that even now. 

Over the last year, things have been really crap for me. A lot of very, very bad things happened in my life (to do with my family). As a result, I fell back into bad habits because I downright could not be bothered to 'maintain' my lower weight (I was still as hungry as a fat person even after losing all the weight constantly, my appetite never disappeared after the lifelong fatness and eating like a fat person, so it's been a constant thing to 'maintain') and just ate meals etc without thinking about what was going in. 

Obviously, I have put on a lot of weight due to my negligence. 

My boyfriend is still as complimentary, still as loving, still calls me the most beautiful woman in the world, still as gorgeous.. but physically, he is way less affectionate and the changes in his physical affection leave me with no doubt that he is much less attracted to me even though he still loves me. A couple of times he has lost an erection with me. He initiates sex less. I don't blame him **at all** for this. Not **at all**. He still treats me so amazingly well emotionally, like a princess.

I want to lose weight too, as I know he would prefer me to (even though he has never said it, it's *very* obvious in the way I explained). I was happy thinner, and I am feeling terrible about myself now. I want to be attractive for me, and for him. It hurts me to see him not want to touch me as much, all that. Obviously I want to be and feel healthier too.

I brought up that I needed to change my current eating habits with my boyfriend, and lose weight again (he knew I was obese as a kid and most of my life). He told me that he loved me as I was, didn't require me to lose weight to love me, I was still as beautiful as ever to him, but he would support me. It was a good conversation, he said all the right things.

---

**Problem**:

He is not at all supportive in action. By this I mean, he will bring me huge chocolate bars and cakes and pastries as 'treats' way too often. Every time he sees me pretty much. When we spend time together, he will cook really fatty meals. When we spend time together and I cook, he will ask for unhealthy food.. and then get on my case when I tell him I am happy to do that but will cook myself a different meal. 

I have spoken to him about this. I have said that while I LOVE that he wants to treat me, those are definitely all my favourite foods, I really appreciate it.. he needs to stop bringing me them, because it doesn't help my willpower (which is already really fucking bad) and I don't want to throw away the treats he brings me anyway because I don't want to feel rude.

When I talk to him about this, he says he understands and wont do it anymore, and wants to support me in my weight loss. Then he keeps doing it.

I was very low on money this month due to overspending at Christmas for family (I went overboard because of the shitty year, I'm usually VERY good with my money) and my boyfriend - being fantastic - offered to get my a big grocery shop in until I next got paid. I accepted. What he bought me was INSANE. So, so much food. I didn't even eat that much when I was at my biggest. 

I told him that was *a lot* of food, a lot of unhealthy food too, he tells me 'Well, its nearly Christmas. Treat yourself!'. So now I have a kitchen full of food.. not helping my willpower, once again (although I am sneakily palming off bits and pieces of what he bought me to my mother to take home..)

I do not understand. This man is not a chubby chaser. Every girlfriend he has had has been slim and beautiful. I was chubby when we got together, but I was a curvy 'thick' type of chubby rather than jiggly fat chubby at that size (and looked quite good!). Not to mention what I said before, that his lack of physical affection proves that he's not as attracted to me. A couple of times he's found it hard to keep an erection with me.

He is lean, and toned, and *looks* athletic even though he's really not. He doesn't work out or anything, he just has the look. The only thing I can think of is that he eats like a fucking HORSE. I have no idea how he fits it all in, or how he stays lean and looking fit like that, and it's all really unhealthy food he eats 100% of the time and a lot of it.. but I can't eat food like that if I want to be lean. Maybe he thinks I can? But I can't. I have to eat a LOT less to lose weight and maintain that weight. Thats my only explanation for his actions, but that still doesn't explain why he seems to agree when I tell him that I want him to stop buying me unhealthy food as 'treats', but then ignores it completely and carries on doing it to an extreme amount.

I just want to understand, and I just want him to be supportive rather than making it harder on my willpower and in general

She comes back and acts weird for a couple of weeks and just one week before the submission of my thesis, she tells me she cheated on me with this guy who was hosting her. It was a huge shock for me. She had told me on the first day that this chap also has a girlfriend etc. She told me they made out for a while and stopped because she felt guilty. I am not aware of details. She sounded very remorseful and was apologizing profusely. When i asked why, she said he was being nice and she got carried away. It hurts badly every time I think of that.

So long story short, I moved into a new house a few months ago because my old apartment sold and the new owners wanted to occupy the place. I ended up moving in with a random house mate off Gumtree (let's call him A) who had two spare rooms in his house. The other spare bedroom was filled by another house mate [24 M] (let's call him M). The three of us get along really well and we're like a happy little family - we are super lucky as we all have similar schedules and genuinely love spending time together. 


A week or so in, A and I went out to watch a soccer game (World cup). We got home at 6:00am, and after a big night, he ended up kissing me. That proceeded to taking things to the bedroom. From then on, we have continued to sleep together for the past few months and it's pretty plausible to say that we are 'seeing each other'. We have made it pretty clear that we are exclusive and wouldn't bring other people home with us, but we also haven't talked about what we are. 


In terms of our behaviour, we have sex a few times a week, sleep in each other's beds, cuddle and cook for each other - generally cutesy coupley things. The only thing we don't do is behave like this in public or when there's someone else/our friends around. Our other housemate, M, has no idea. He is very clueless and a total sweetheart so I don't think he would ever suspect (we try and be really good around him as we don't want him to feel awkward/excluded in his own house). I think if this continues on and we get more serious, we will have to tell him and continue to make sure he is comfortable.


We have also talked about moving overseas (not explicitly together) and we both seem to agree that we would love to move countries and continue to travel. We have also talked about how we would raise our kids, where we want to be, life goals, etc. They all seem to align pretty well even though there's a significant age gap...


At the end of the day, I'm worried about two things - 1. How do we avoid making it awkward for the 3rd housemate (M)? I know this isn't what he signed up to in terms of living with a couple, but everything continues to go well and we still get along. If we do become official, we would try really hard to make sure he feels integrated into the house hold and not exclude him. What is fair?
2. What happens now? How does seeing each other turn into a relationship? Will it even turn into a relationship? Is it worth bringing up? Will bringing it up this soon make me seem overly interested and clingy?


Any advice, etc. would be highly appreciated :-)

I approached it thinking that we would try to make things better, never thinking that he might actually be done with me. He's the most loving, kind person and he's always been so invested in our relationship until recently.

He said he still loves me but he hasn't been happy and it isn't exactly me but lots of things, stressful job and other things he couldn't name.

I'm so devastated that I don't know what to do with myself, but we live together so I have to find a new place. The thought of finding somewhere and moving in with strangers is almost too much. He's not pushing me to move straight away, though I assume he wants me gone as soon as possible.

My problem is that it's going to take me a while to find somewhere, and there's no other room for one of us to have longer than a couple of nights until I do get somewhere new (flatmate away til Wednesday).

Last night I asked him to stay in the flatmate's room, but he heard me crying so came back in and kept hugging me and eventually slept in there with me.

I want to believe that he's doing this because he still loves me and there's a chance he'll change his mind, but i know I'm kidding myself. Should I just ask him to stay with his friend for the next few days? I'm close to saying he can stay just because I need to be around him.

12409,Relationships,2usou0,"I've been dating my boyfriend for a while and it's been ok, and he said something to me recently that I found disturbing. 


Background is that he used to mention girls he interacts and finds attractive in front me. In my opinion, he did this at a really high frequency, especially in situations I found inappropriate such as when we were having sex. Additionally, there were some girls he would talk about multiple times. I told him it bothered me and asked him to stop telling me stuff like that so he did. I also told him it bothered me he thought about these people at such a high frequency especially when we were together. 


Recently, my boyfriend told me that he thinks about whether being with me is worth the cost of not getting to be with all these other girls he sees and finds attractive. I was kind of taken aback by this statement because it made me question how much he values our relationship.


I don't have a problem in theory with someone checking out other girls. I look at guys occasionally myself. I think it is made worse that my boyfriend always checks out people he interacts with and talks to versus porn stars, celebrities, or someone else that you would never actually date. I think I do not feel secure enough and/or appreciated enough in our relationship to be comfortable with the amount he does it. I also worry about how much he values the emotional part of our relationship. 


I am pretty hurt by his behavior, but I don't know if I am overreacting. I guess I am considering ending it to find someone who is more interested in being with me. However, in my understanding, guys notice attractive girls way more and in a way I do not understand because I am a girl.

He also has stopped telling me after I asked him too. However, when we are together I still feel like I know that is what he is thinking.

12411,Breakups,1l0giu,"So it has been three weeks now since I broke up with him. Some days are harder than others, and last night which was my childhood best friend's wedding was one of the hardest. Okay, for some backstory:

We met at college, did long distance for a year when he went overseas after graduating, long distance again when we were in different cities while I was still in school, and then had one year (this past year) where we were in the same city and basically lived together. Besides this past summer/year, we have had a great relationship. We both love being outdoors and active, we run, bike, hike, camp, rollerblade, workout together. We have similar life goals and aspirations. His family loved and accepted me, his mom was basically planning on our future kids. Everyone, our friends, family, my SO and even myself sort of assumed we would get married in a few years. 

The Problems:

He has some serious anxiety and vulnerability problems that have really gotten to me.  He stresses out, ruminates, and obsesses over everything. Swollen lymph nodes? He thinks he has cancer. Messed up something on an exam? It's going to ruin his career. He is *extremely* anal and his obsessing gets really exhausting. I would humor him for a while, but eventually I wanted him to let things go which he had trouble doing. 

He also has problems being emotional and empathetic. He sort of had an emotional breakdown this past winter where he obsessed over death and how he would eventually lose everything he ever cared about (i.e. me, his family, career). I think ever since then he has been putting up an emotional roadblock again. He also values being restrained, logical and controlled so emotion really isn't his thing. However, it *is* my thing. I am a super emotional person, who cries whenever we get in fights because I hate being in conflict with him. This in turn, would really upset him and he would become defensive instead of comforting. 

We had been planning on seeing a couples counselor for the past 6-9 months to deal with our issues but it just hasn't been able to happen yet. He worked a 9-5, and life just kept getting in the way. We thought this fall might work, but I might be going to a different side of the country for an internship. Eitherway, I have a lot of work to do on figuring out wtf I am doing with the rest of my life. Finally, though, I was just tired and fed up of our fairly often spats over nothing. We just haven't been on the same page for so long now, and this past summer was so weird and different between us. There has just been more meh or bad than good times and I haven't been super happy.

I should also mention that I feel like he hadn't been giving me what I wanted for a while. Didn't try as hard as he used to to make me feel like a princess and make me feel like he was in love with me. Wouldn't respond to my jokes like I hoped. Wasn't as physically affectionate as I wanted. Many of the nice things he would do simply because I've told him I wished he would do those types of things. 

Now my question:

Did I end things prematurely? His main issue with the breakup is that we never gave couples counseling a real try. I love him so much still and it hurts not to be with him. Every day I imagine what fun things we could be doing and at the wedding last night, it sucked so much not to have him there with me. At the same time, I know it partly would have been artifical since things haven't been great between us.

12412,Relationships,1ok8tn,"Brief background.  We met on what was essentially a blind date through my best friend.  Hit it off completely, he's honestly the best man I have ever dated (far from perfect) but our communication and conflict resolution is better than I have ever hoped for.  We don't live together but marriage and rings have been brought up in a (what I think) was serious way.

I might be slightly insecure (having been sick for the last 3 years have put on about 25lbs from 125lbs to 150lbs now.  Not horrible but definitely a little insecure from it.)  He isn't the most affectionate guy in the world so my insecurity can flair up a bit.  


Here is the deal.  Found myself unable to sleep tonight and going to deep into facebook.  Turns out I have a mutual friend with his ex on Facebook (Dated long distance for less than 8 months Dallas-D.C. saw each other very little).  She had commented on something and I clicked on her profile.  I noticed she is dating a new guy.  Good for her.  Here is the rub though.  My boyfriend foolishly leased a car for her in the period of time they were together, which she stopped making payments on, if she ever made them.  So every month he is paying $300 for her car.  Her license was/is suspended for some reason or another and its my understanding this is not uncommon for her.  I have no clue if she is paying for insurance on the car.  For all I know my BF is paying that too.  He's told her several times he was going to come collect the car but never followed through, tells me the $300 a month isn't worth the drama of going to get the car and he'll still be paying that if he has the car here anyway. (I think he feels like he can't take the car from her because she is a single mom).


I'm not sure he understands the full legal ramifications of what the lease being in his name is.  Plus, I am just super weirded out by the fact that he is still paying for an ex's car.  


I feel he takes care of a lot of the people in his life and gets taken advantage of because of it.  I think he's less inclined to take chances with me because of this trend.  So I find myself going out of my way to do anything I can for him so HE feels taken care of for once.  But its definitely put a line down (whether I put it down with my imagination or he actually does put one down is debatable) between us as far as me feeling like I can't lean on him if I ever needed to.


I have brought this up in the past, he'll tell her he is coming to get it then nothing.  I found super cheap flights from DC to Dallas on the 25 of OCT.  I plan on flying down with him so we can marathon drive back.  I don't want or need to go with him when he picks up the car.  Am I being caring or crazy bringing this up?

She never knew I was saving up all that money, I was going to surprise her this year...I told her but yeah, I guess it was too late, her mind was made up. 


It's been over a month since I've had any contact with her and I just feel like crap, I keep having dreams about her, dreams that we're back together, I love her so much it's sick.

I don't drink for various reasons, so it was very difficult to find friends the first weeks and very sad/lonely.  About a week and a half in, I met Brynne through a friend of a friend of someone on my floor.  She's very intelligent, much more cultured than me, and moderately attractive.  We've been hanging out a lot since then.  No one else here has gotten along with me that well.

Now today, my family came to visit, and I invite Brynne to come with us to go on a hike/dinner picnic.  It was pretty fun, everyone got along, whatever.  But then, we got back to my room and decided to watch a movie; one thing lead to another, and three hours later we were still feverishly making out.

It wasn't bad.  Naturally, it felt good and seemed like a decent idea at the time.  But while it was going on, she would randomly say my name or talk about how I'm her best friend or call me by some pet-name like honey or sweetie which seemed a little odd.  Now I'm filled with regret because I think she may be really attached to this romantic idea, while I'm not sure if going beyond platonic is a good idea.  Also might help to note that she said she had been waiting for me to kiss her, and she knew it was going to happen tonight.

Since then we've had good one-on-one conversations whenever we see each other in social situations or by chance, but they are usually short. I felt like I got a vibe - he always seems engaged and a little nervous when talking to me. We are in a language practice group together (it meets once a week), and in those conversations he has mentioned paying attention to what I listen to on social media, etc. I get the impression that he is a little shy and quirky. 

Now, I know that the above are not at all certain indications that he is interested. I've always had a little crush and wanted to get to know him more, so I asked him out to visit a museum. I didn't say I'm interested, let's go on a date, instead it was more like I like art, you like art, would you be interested in coming to this exhibition with me. He said yes and we had a really nice time. We had quite animated conversations about our interests in art, dreams, philosophy and music, and he suggested grabbing lunch after the museum.

I am at a loss of words and feel broken. I am not sure what to do. I do care for my ex and want to try and make things work out. I am deeply saddened I lost a friend in the process. I am a far aways from home with no real connection here and both of them are on my mind haunting me.

I want to reconnect with my ex. But in the past I was always the one that made the first move. To ensure an opportunity, I bought him a personal gift and sent it to my mother to give to him. My hopes are that he will call or connect with me to thank me for them and thus starting a conversation of some sort. If he doesn't reach out, should I? 

I am sorry for the long story; it's all related as I just feel incapable of human interaction as a result of both these failed relationships. I am mourning a friend while missing an ex. I am unsure what to do.

12423,Relationships,1gr1kr,"I've been with my SO for four years. He is my first serious relationship, the only guy that I've ever even slept with. He means the world to me but throughout the relationship there has been issues with him smoking weed. I didn't know about it at first. I guess you can say I was naive about the whole situation. I had to deal with my biological mother being an addict my whole life so I never wanted to have a SO who did drugs of any sort. Its been a back and forth for some time now between us. I keep telling him he needs to stop or I'm not going to be with him. He'll stop for a while then I'll find out he's doing it again. I've already broke up with him for the same reason once thinking that would scare him into realizing that I was serious about leaving him if he couldn't stop smoking. 

As far as I know weed is not supposed to be addictive so he should just be able to quit no problem.  The thing I don't understand is I've given him an ultimatum, either be with me, drug-free or continue smoking and be single. He says he wants to be with me but to him smoking is not a big deal. He says he doesn't want to quit.

I'm also worried about him getting into other drugs. Just the other day I found a text message to one of his buddies that said he had gotten some Vicodin from someone at work and planned to save it for a fun day. Obviously I can't really confront him about this because I was snooping through his phone. But its really got me pissed. What comes next? Shrooms, ecstasy? Where does he draw the line when it comes to illegal drugs? 

I feel like we keep having the same conversation over and over and he just doesn't seem to understand how much he can lose if he continues to smoke weed. He says I'm the most most important thing in his life but at the same time if that were true he would stop smoking. It's the ONE thing I don't want to deal with in a relationship. I am beginning to feel like if I stay with him, the rest of my life I'm always going to come second to smoking weed. By him not stopping he's basically saying he would rather smoke weed than stay with me. 

Am I being unreasonable to ask him to stop smoking? How much longer should I deal with all of this? I really want to be able to fix things. I've invested 4 years of my life on this guy and I don't just want to walk away but at the same time I don't want to be in a relationship if I can't trust my SO. I need some advice.

12424,Breakups,1xyx43,"Dated this beautiful girl for about 2 years. We had a lot of bumps along the way, arguing a lot of the time but seemingly getting stronger as the arguments started fading away. Around September, I found out that it wasn't that we were getting stronger; her interest in the relationship grew weaker and weaker. We broke up, and I felt shittier than I ever had in my life. 

Fast forward to about a month. She's still not completely over me, and I'm most definitely not over her. We sleep with each other and it seems like we're somewhat back together. For some (odd at the time) reason, she didn't want to label the relationship. It had to be friends with benefits. For nigh on four months, we periodically see each other, hang out and sleep with each other. My feelings are as strong as ever, and I'm convinced that she's feeling the same way. 

I fell into some sort of depression phase around the end of December...completely fell off the grid. I didn't talk to anyone, including this girl. She sometimes contacted me but it was certainly not as frequent as before. On new years, she hooks up with another guy. 

Before, when we first started hooking up with each other again, we laid down some rules. As soon as one of us (she) loses interest, we have to cut friends with benefits off. No leading one another on etc. I agree, thinking that there wouldn't be a point in the future where this will happen. Boy, was I wrong.

I had to keep asking her what's up, why aren't you speaking etc? I asked her how her new years was, and she was very hesistant to speak about it. I wasn't oblivious, and asked the question. I got the answer straight away. 

Although I didn't exactly have the right to be, (and I understand that now) I got extremely angry. Here I am, looking like a fool, thinking our relationship is going one way and it's as if she's breaking up with me....AGAIN. She tells me she regrets hooking up with the guy, and it was disgusting and she wouldn't do it.

Fast forward a week. I'm walking to a party, and my heart drops right to my stomach. The worst possible sight I could ever see, was this girl making out vigorously with the same guy..the one she said she regretted hooking up with. I yell out her name, yell out a gigantic FUCK YOU and walk away. I cried the entire way back to my apartment, and felt completely numb. The usual feelings of despair, loneliness and an utter sense of not knowing what to do. 

I needed closure. I needed some explanation for this, for why she lost interest, why she left me AGAIN. I almost sort of stalked her, while she was leaving her class. You'd think that after everything, she would be able to own up to what she said, have the guts to tell me what she did and why she did it. I needed something, some explanation. When I saw her the day after, she didn't want to talk. I had to kind of force her to speak to me. In our conversation, it was more about how I felt, but not how she felt. She barely offered any input from her side, but just listened to my rantings. At this point, my mind is frazzled, my thoughts are racing and I have no idea what my point at all was. I confessed that I still loved her, that i went through depression, that I need closure and that she had to explain herself. I didn't get much, and she said she didn't want to talk to me anymore.

It hurt so much more to hear her say that, and it threw me back into spiraling depression. That period of time was bad...really bad. I was just numb to everything. I had so many responsibilities, and I shunned them all. I didn't eat, didn't sleep for too long, drank myself to blackout nights etc. 

Thankfully I have some amazing friends who were able to help me. They just listened to what I had to say, and I'm in a MUCH better place than I was before. I'm not in depression, and I can get through the day without feeling overwhelmed with sadness that I don't see her anymore. To this day, I'm not exactly sure what she's up to. Her friends are my friends, yet I don't know what she's up to. It sucks, and I can't seem to get over that aspect.

Looking back, I realize that I didn't have the right to question why she did what she did. She lost interest in me, so she did whatever she wanted to. Eventually, I will get used to that and it won't hurt as much. Here's my question:

Why does she not want anything to do with me? Some things I didn't mention in the wall of text above is that I repeatedly asked her to meet with me, just so we can completely talk this out and I can gain some sort of closure, rather than being left to my own speculation and going batshit insane. She refused to see me! Not even coffee, nothing. It was just another beating to my heart (no pun intended) and it just hurt even more. After everything we had been through, I felt like I deserved some respect in the sense that I can get a direct explanation of her feelings. Something that I can use to apply rationale to her behavior. NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. If I asked if we could meet, she would ask do we have to? I don't want your feelings rushing back every time you see me. It just hurt to see exactly how much she despised seeing my face.

Not to mention, a year ago, she was in a bad place. Didn't have many friends, had a bad family situation and she needed me. I was there every step of the way, took care of her. I'd expect that after what I did to help her, she would attribute some importance to our relationship, whether it be friendship or our romantic relationship. 
I attribute so much importance to my relationship with her because I, too, was in a deep depression when I first met her. She was the person that helped me the most, and I could not appreciate everything she had done. Knowing that I helped her too, why is she acting like she doesn't want to even know me? Why does she act like I'm nothing? Is she that selfish? Am I being selfish? I don't know. Any answers would be extremely helpful.

12426,Relationships,2y7w68,"Hey guys. Throwaway for obvious reasons. So I've been dating this girl for almost two years now. I've always had periods of intense sadness/anxiety, but the last time it happened was almost two years before the start of this relationship. Now, it's come back full force (worse than before, and I'm seeing a therapist so I know it's depression of some sort) and it's starting to affect our relationship.


A little bit of background: We are each others' everything. We're both in school, and we're each others' best friends. Neither of us has any other super close friends at school (back home is another story), and we spend a ton of time together (we're different majors and have different activities, so there's the obvious time we spend apart doing schoolwork/meetings, etc, but we both have our own bedrooms and can stay over at each others' places as often as we want). We're usually pretty good together - we've had a few major fights, even broke up briefly (for about an hour), but I'd like to think that we're improving (for the most part, it's me who's to blame).


We've both had our sad spells, but we've always relied on each other to pull ourselves out of them. This year, for some reason, both of us have started to have these spells. I don't know about her, but I've been hit particularly hard - I don't have the motivation to do anything, and I feel like I have to drag myself out of bed to do anything, including see her. She's started to have these spells to. She's had occasions where she's tried to drag me out of them, but it hasn't worked because of my depression, and that only makes her feel worse. Right now, she doesn't want to see me because she's done trying to help me, and because she feels like my sadness is feeding hers.


Let me be clear: I love this girl more than anything in the world. She's done things for me that I didn't think it was possible for another human being to do - she's made me love and care about someone more than I thought I ever could, she's made me more emotionally away, she's let me bring my walls down (I'm in a pretty emotional place right now, if you can't tell). I really really really want this to work out, even after school. I know I have to focus on myself, but this girl really means the world to me, and would kill me to lose her. Please help me.

12429,Relationships,39u26r,"My boyfriend [25 M] and I [27 F] are amazing together. I won't give the whole list, but it's by far the best relationship I've had and I'd love for it to last. We've been together a year and a half now. The only problem is I literally cannot remember the last time we had sex. I know we haven't done it even *once* this year. Sex was great for about the first month and then just plummeted. I don't think I'm on the high end of the spectrum as far as sex drives go, but literally no sex whatsoever is causing me all kinds of problems, including:

* Feeling unattractive or undesirable to him.
* Blaming myself for not knowing how to initiate it better - I grew up in a pretty religious environment, so I didn't have sex until after college, which means I'm still incredibly shy about asking for sex. The verbal and nonverbal queues I have used with past BFs aren't working here.
* Feeling like I'm not good enough at sex, and therefore he's not interested. I don't get hung up about it in the moment, but I do privately at other times.
* I've spent more and more time looking at porn and masturbating, which isn't helping so much as increasing my frustration.
* Giving me ridiculous ideas like asking myself if I should ask him about an open relationship, despite the fact that I've never been one for casual sex. Ever.
* My sexual tension level has gone bonkers concerning a particular individual who I've been very sexually attracted to for a long time. It's the first time in the relationship that I've fantasized about someone who's not my BF and I hate it because that's the first step on the road to trouble as far as I'm concerned. I feel like if I had any sex life at all with my BF, I wouldn't give the other guy a second sexual thought because I know with 100% certainty that I don't want to hurt my BF or lose all the amazing things that I *do* have with my BF.

I have brought up the lack of sex on at least three different occasions throughout the course of our relationship, and I've taken his responses at his word every time. **The first time,** I explained it was making me feel unattractive to him, and he reassured me that this wasn't the case, which calmed me down for a while. **The second time,** I explained how I felt like it was my fault for being clueless and inexperienced or flat out bad at sex, and again, he said no, that wasn't it, he was just tired and/or stressed frequently. Then this winter he thought he had a thyroid problem due to other symptoms and went in to see the doctor about it. I was hoping that if it was a hormonal problem, perhaps things would upswing again if he got treatment, but it turns out his hormones are fine and it's just a vitamin deficiency, so no dice.

**The third, and most recent, time** I asked about the lack of sex, I asked if he's been like this in past relationships and he was very, very shy about the conversation. He hasn't had many relationships this long (just one other, the one before me, in fact) and she didn't really want sex, so he stopped having sex. It seems to me like his drive never came back after that. I straight up asked him if he had any problems with me masturbating and he said he didn't. I also tried to get him to open up about things like fetishes, sharing some of my own first to try to help the conversation, but he decided he didn't really have any. I asked if there was any porn he liked and he drew a blank. I know he was sexually active back in high school because we're open with each other, so I've heard some of the stories. I don't understand where that drive went.

I thought I would be ok without the sex since my drive is moderate to low most of the time, but recent trends indicate that this doesn't seem to be the case. I don't know what else to do at this point. I can't even get him to take his clothes off around me, despite making a point to let him know how attractive I find him. We've never showered together, which is something I enjoy even when no sex is involved. He rarely sleeps even shirtless, let alone in just underwear or nude. I'm now completely incapable of trying to initiate anything because nothing seems to work. I don't want to lose him, but if something doesn't give I feel like I'm setting myself up for failure in the future. I thought I'd be alright just masturbating we I needed to relieve the tension, since again, I'm not someone with a super high sex drive, but this flare up of an old attraction especially has me really, really concerned that the lack of sex could get me into some stupid trouble in the long term if nothing changes.
   
**tl;dr: Everything is awesome but we literally *never* have sex. I thought I could handle it, but I can't. My sex drive isn't through the roof, myself, but I do want intimacy with my BF. I've brought it up three times before and nothing has changed. What other options do I have? Is counseling expensive?

Backstory (long but important): We met while I was visiting family out of state, so while we did meet in person initially, the first year of the relationship was long distance, until I moved to live in the same state, where we saw each other about every week and I stayed nights at her family's house. 


Around this time I lost my virginity, and we made it like rabbits, as new couples do. And it was this way for a while, with the sex gradually decreasing in frequency and intensity. A few years later we moved out together. It was a new beginning for a while, we felt like we did in the beginning again. 


Again, things were great for a while, but after a time it got difficult again. I ended up cheating on her while drunk at a party, but I picked up the courage to come out and tell her what happened. A few months later we moved back in with our families and resumed seeing each other about weekly. 


I've slowly been realizing some personal problems that have hurt our relationship,  and I'm not sure they can be sorted while I'm still committed to her.


I always tend to see things in a negative light.


 If I don't get that one thing I really wanted, I'll overlook all the other positives.


I've missed my experimental stage, and would like to have some wild times with drugs and women, but I've just been suppressing urges.


Our differences in sexual needs is really frustrating for both of us, and it makes simple things I want to do like not cheating, much harder. She needs something emotional from me that I don't know how to give her. So I haven't been able to reciprocate her needs for mine. 


I lack any kind of drive or passion for anything specific. All my effort has gone into our relationship.


Now, imagine all these problems,  but with two people who feel so bound and attached that we can't imagine separating. Life without one another seems impossible. We've grown so comfortable and complacent in our problems that we don't acknowledge them face to face. Almost all our arguments have been in text messages. 


I don't know how to begin fixing our problems,  but I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I left her without giving it my best effort to make it work. I can't imagine loving someone else, or someone else loving me as much as she does, but I couldn't keep going the way things were. 

TL;DR:  this is my first serious relationship,  7 years in, there aretons of problems we haven't sorted. I can't decide whether to leave her and work on my personal problems alone, or our relationship problems together. But my personal problems make everything harder.


How do I go about this? How do I begin resolving our issues in a healthy way? Is it pointless to try until I'm a whole person myself? Should I break up with someone I've been with for almost a third of my life?

My sister clearly welcomed me with open arms. Because she's already made a big success for herself, and so has her husband (my brother-in-law, 33M), she is able to 1) financially support me and 2) financially put me through all 4 years of graduate school so that I don't need loans. I am in an extremely fortunate situation. 

I've been with my GF for 7 years now. She wants me to move in with her, soon. She understands my situation but is very frustrated - and it isn't for finding an intimate place. She wants to move into the next stage of our relationship. She works, but doesn't make nearly as much as my sister does - which is at no fault of her own, as she is working hard to get up the corporate ladder to support herself. I am NOT in a position to work. My graduate schedule is 8-5 courses/lab work and 5-evening studying extensively for courses. This is not a research position, therefore I am not getting a stipend. I'd rather not disclose my school, but it's very related to medical school. My sister has also stressed that she'd rather me not work at all as she can support me and wants to see me succeed. 

My GF has pointed out that she feels my maturity may be stunted as I have never moved out on my own before. I agree and disagree. I don't believe I am immature, in the least. I've been able to carry myself (academically) this far and I plan to go farther. But what she means by immature is that - like I just stated - I have not been on my own. For my undergraduate studies, I commuted all 4 years for financial reasons. I immediately entered graduate school, where I moved but happened to move with my sister. The decision to choose that particular graduate school was slightly influenced due to my sister's presence, but was also higher ranked than all the other schools. In terms of domestic responsibilities, I've been raised well and I carry my own weight in terms of chores. I am aware there are still things I'm not able to learn on my own still living with family at my age. 

My GF doesn't know if she can hold out moving in for me for 3 more years, but I don't know what to tell her. As much as I would love to move in with her, it would be highly impractical on my part. Some things to consider 

1) My GF says she will 100% support me / pay rent. My sister will continue to pay my tuition. She highly disproves of the situation but knows she cannot stop me. She still wants to support me by paying tuition instead of deserting me. 

2) My GF will not move in with my sister and I. This was an inappropriate situation, anyways. 

3) My sister prefers not to pay for additional housing for me, which I prefer not to bring up again as it is also inappropriate. 

My sister, of course, wants me to stay with her. My GF wants me to move in with her. 

I'd appreciate any input on a new perspective of my situation. Thank you. 

**TL;DR**: My girlfriend wants me to move in with her, and I'd like to as well. In the practical sense, it is better for me to stay with my sister. I am torn down the middle. Please provide perspectives. 

EDIT: To add, I genuinely enjoy living with my sister, and not just because she supports me financially. 

EDIT 2: My GF currently lives with roommates. If I tell her that I want to move in with her, she'll find a place for us. If I tell her no, she will find a place with roommates so she doesn't waste money. That why was time mattered - her lease will be up in a few(?) months. 

I do not know if my sister will financially support me (or to what extent - besides tuition) if I do move out.

Now we live an hour apart. She works 6 days a week to pay for a brand new car she can't afford. The dealership wowed her dad with a personalized video of the car so he picked that one for her. I kind of feel like she picked having a brand new car over seeing me more often.

Lately, when I do see her she's stressed out like crazy. I told her how unpleasant she was to be around and she apologized and said it wouldn't happen again. I told her it's okay for her to be stressed out sometimes but she's been that way all summer.

I recently went through being dumped a few days ago, and it's been extremely hard to deal with. Everything is absolutely a huge mess, the majority of it being my fault. At some point following the breakup I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation, and I possibly have either bipolar, borderline personality disorder, or both. 

I know time heals and I'll get over him, but I can't kick this intense fear that I'm broken and undeserving of love. I feel like I'm a bad person, and that I'm crazy. I've been doing risky, impulsive things recently and I feel lost, and like I don't know who I am. I can't stop feeling self-loathing and damaged. Every night now I either have nightmares or really great dreams, and I wake up with a sinking feeling in my stomach and wishing I was dead. I feel so ashamed of myself that I'm taking this so badly, that I can't just get over it and forget about it. 

With the breakup, Initially I felt like everything was my fault but now it's confusing. Now I feel like there were things handled badly on both of our parts, but I question my judgment a lot. I feel like we were both in the wrong, but I fear that it indeed was entirely my fault and that this is a sign that I might be narcissistic and I can't see my own faults. I feel afraid of myself and who I might be.

12435,Infidelity,3cf9bi,"This past 4th of July weekend, a week before our wedding, I saw on my (now ex) fiance's phone Friday night some Skype messages from an unfamiliar person. I'd given him his privacy for 2 months after he complained how I always looked at his phone during dinner instead of talking to him, and how I appeared not to trust him. I had enjoyed our transparency with sharing our passwords/accounts previously. We have been engaged 2 years, together 4 years.
 
So I was a bit taken about by pictures a girl sent of her cleavage and in other clothing. There were a lot of messages so I couldn't read it all through in a few minutes; I asked him about why a girl was sending picture of her chest. He said it was just of her in a dress. I then asked to read the rest of the thread. Then he started panicking. 

I was getting angry that he obviously was hiding something. He told me to wait until the morning to read it. After hours of arguing, I went outside of the room we were staying in and figured out his Skype password, and discovered the extent of his emotional affair. He had told her she was pretty, he missed her, he made multiple video calls and phone calls to her over the 1.5 months he had discovered her online. He paraded himself as if he was single.

He told me that night that she knew he was kind of with someone. And that he wrote 4 letters to her -- 3 more than he wrote me that month. That he used his work return address because he didn't want to be creepy -- even though he got her home address from her. It felt like so many lies, why couldn't he just tell me the truth, that he didn't use our address so I wouldn't discover it? This was just one of the small lies he used to protect himself after I discovered this.

In the morning after the discovery (Saturday), I told him to tell his brother. While he did, I saw something even more heartbreaking. He sent her a screenshot of tickets he bought to see her in Mexico (we are in California) after the wedding. I was **livid**. He was going to fly out the weekend I was out of town, and I remembered how he gradually mentioned going to Mexico for work but he wasn't sure when they were going to send him, and I believe it was to warm me up to the idea of him going. He claims he cancelled the tickets the next day, that he just wanted her to see it to entice her to continue talking to him.

I was upset and cried. I soon met up with a nearby friend at noon who helped me make the right decision in cancelling the wedding. Do you really want to look back on your pictures with regret? he asked. I was so reluctant because we had planned so much to appease his family, and the huge monetary investments we made to it. That all the costs we lost now (~10k+ for each of us) would be nothing compared to the future. Then I spent the afternoon with friends to distract me. They were all surprised by my fiance's actions. My fiance had always been my biggest cheerleader in life. And to do this...

His brother asked to meet up early that evening and brought their mother. Their family had always been good to me. They were both shocked by my fiance's actions. His mother was tearful and asked what happened. I showed them the Skype messages and explained his trip to Mexico. It had been too coincidental that he requested I move my plans around to be out of town the same weekend he was going to Mexico to see her. That he was telling all of us peripherally about possibly going to Mexico. That he was using all the same lines to lure women to talk to him like he did to me. Calling them genuine, one of a kind, special, how he never met anyone like them (oh yes, on Sunday I discovered he was chatting with another girl and asking for pix of her in a bra). His mother said that my fiance told her that he just wanted someone to talk to and we weren't talking. There were reasons why I didn't talk to him anymore.

We had issues leading up to the wedding. I told her about how he had a temper and would be unexpectedly snappy with me. How he hated me talking during tv shows or movies, and made fun of me talking about my day or food during dinner, the only meal we usually shared after our long day at work. My fiance did ask me the past 2 months why I wasn't talking or responding to him. My usual response was a quiet, You know why or silence after one of his particularly explosive episodes. I told his mom and brother, how could I talk to him when he was like this? That he always made me feel guilty and punished me for my parents' ruining his proposal surprise. 

About two years ago my fiance threw a big wine surprise engagement party for me; but the surprise had been discreetly ruined by my parents. He asked for their permission to marry me after all his plans were set. My mom exposed the surprise party, and it was the beginning of the downward spiral of our relationship. My fiance could not handle cancelling the party he spent so long to set up. So even though I did have a good time when it happened, I eventually could no longer appreciate it because of all the anger he unleashed whenever it came to my parents and what they did. 

He would try to get his revenge by controlling my finances concerning my parents; I made regular contributions to them out of my paycheck but he would think it's too much. Anything I gave to them was too much. We fought a lot over me supporting my family financially since they were retired and I made a pretty healthy living. 

When I explained how I was being punished for the proposal, his mom had said how she did try to convince him that a good person would try to support their family, and a bad person wouldn't. But he was stubborn. How could I continue to be with someone continually pitting me against my family? He almost didn't allow them to be in the wedding but very, very grudgingly did.

She asked why I told him not to tell people about our issues, which was very untrue. I had seen how our issues made him internally frustrated and kept asking him to talk to his family, but he was too proud. My only rule was that he not talk to girls in the grey area of friendship -- girls who I didn't really know. When we first dated, he had originally set up a rule that we should never talk to the opposite gender about relationship problems -- yet HE was the one so magnificently broke it! His hypocrisy was maddening.

She asked if I could give him a second chance. Then I told her about our recent anniversary in April. How I forgot. But he sent an edible arrangement to my work. The first thing I thought? He is going to be so fucking mad at me for forgetting! (Isn't this a bad first thought?) So I went out, got him a card, and 20 or so specialty sodas in root beer, orange, and cream flavors since he loved those. He accepted the gifts. But the next day, we were driving to the gym, and something had irritated me but I didn't want to say because it wasn't that big of a deal since I'd forget about it in a few hours. He insisted on knowing. I said it, and then he blew up and was extremely physically scary and agitated. He was irate that I could complain about a little thing when I forgot our anniversary, and how could I give him a half assed gift, and how he knew I forgot. He was going to drop me off at the gym instead of going with me, but I decided to go back home and get my own car so I didn't have to ask him to pick me up. 

I got into my car and called one of my best friends crying. How could I be spending my life with someone who could be so angry? And set me up for failure multiple times? At any point in the week he could have mentioned that we could do something together. Or give a gentle reminder that we should do something for our anniversary. But... he sent me an edible arrangement when he knew I forgot, and knew it would rile himself up. One time his family did secret santa to prevent us from buying multiple gifts for others. Guess who was the only one who kept to the Secret Santa? Me. And even though we previously agreed not get each other anything, he got me fancy perfume and was pissed I didn't get him anything. He made me feel so ashamed of myself for not being thoughtful enough. How can I win? I couldn't look back on our proposal, Christmas, our anniversary in the same light ever again. Anything he gave had strings attached. I felt like he tricked and trapped me every step of the way.

We had a lot of good times too. Everything before the engagement was great. We loved each other unconditionally; he came up almost as many weekends as he could to spend time with me because we had to do long distance while he was in school. He didn't have much of a college life since so much of his free time was packed trying to get things done before the weekends he and I spent time together at his place or mine. He was a huge romantic and very affectionate. He's made signs and shirts for marathons I've run, he's written me lots of love letters, made a scrapbook about us, he's surprised me sweet gifts, he gave up his life in his small home town to move to be with me, where he had no friends and family. He was never shy about telling everyone we met how great and special I was. He was super outgoing, gregarious, had a magnetic personality and had a knack for elevating anyone he met. We had a lot of firsts together -- skydiving, swimming with dolphins, ice climbing, etc. He could have been anyone's dream guy, with his talent for making people feel attractive and smart. He was handsome and had values and goals aligning with mine. 

But internally, after the anniversary explosion, I decided that he had one last chance of being with me. That weekend of our anniversary I was a broken person, realizing that everything was in motion that I could not stop. He had chosen the ring, the engagement, the wedding date, it was all decided by his side. Despite our difficult times this past year, I had wanted to carry on the wedding for his family; his mom invested a lot in her labor of love to decorate and make sure everything was as she could envision, which was fine by me. Many people from different parts of the world and the US were coming to the wedding. He came from a really close family, people who were very positive and supportive and welcoming and loving. So I was looking forward into marrying into that. And after seeing how depressed I was after his explosion, and spending hours angrily chiding me for things I did wrong, he finally promised not to talk about the past and instead look forward. We always argued tit for tat. It wasn't my preferred method of arguing, but it's difficult when I felt he had a list of things he was dissatisfied with me about.

He lost his last chance, I told his mom. I felt so bad. My fiance had been crying when I confronted him. His mom was crying and telling me how she loved me. It was one of the hardest decisions I had to make.

My fiance has always been very emotional, and according to his little kid sister, who is keeping vigil over him now, he gets up only every 3 hours for 5 minutes and won't eat anything. She can't leave him alone and play with her cousins. This 4th of July weekend was his family's huge reunion, they have one every few years, and there is much love and happiness everywhere. Knowing that his actions caused the wedding everyone came for to be called off has been weighing him down a ton. I know he feels truly remorseful. He and I knew things were getting slightly better after April, when he stopped bringing up the past, but he was lonely. I work long hours, and he hated that. He didn't move out of his parents' house until he came to live with me and got a job where I was, so every time he had went home and left home there was someone around. He was not used to not having others. And I stopped talking to him after April. We never had deep conversations because even the little ones sometimes sparked his ire. I'd suggest a different table sign design and he'd flip; his mom spent so much time already making them, how could I dare suggest that? It was traumatizing each time I tried to do something quirky for the wedding. It could have just been a calm conversation. But with each argument I loved him less and less. So I withdrew. And he felt it, so he chatted up some girls. And I discovered it. And this is how our relationship ended.

He says it was for the attention. That he was lonely. I believe those were his reasons. I just can't believe how immature he is. How much foresight he lacked. What did he think was going to happen when I discovered it? 

He doesn't think of anything of the future but of his present desires. And this is how we ended up so unhappily in the past situations with Christmas, the proposal, our anniversary. How could I be with someone so dumb to do this? He is like a child attempting to outsmart an adult with his obvious lies. When I first discovered the messages he said she knew about our relationship -- and then I found out he led her on to be single this whole time. It made my stomach turn how he could continue to lie to me. He never fully disclosed anything -- everything was an omission where I had to reconstruct the truth from his email/message/verbal history.

I also know he is hurting a lot and understands now how toxic he made our relationship to be. He has taken responsibility for causing me to stop talking to him. He has been texting and calling and apologizing and crying. Calling me his best friend. He's in a really pathetic state right now from the tone of his texts and voice. He's extremely burdened by what he's done. It's affected his whole immediate and extended family. He wants to be with me and see a couples' counselor. We attempted one from a coworker's church before, but he despised it because it was always about resolving things with my mom and his temper (my main reason for seeing them). He was in denial he had a temper since he said no one else said he had one -- I think his family knew but were used to the way he would be with them. I did have stuff to work on like my messiness driving him crazy, me being unable to provide him with enough attention or time. So I'm not sure what the purpose of his couples' counselor would be, because I feel pretty firm on cutting him off. He has so much growing up to do. I'm almost four years older than him. I don't want to wait around that long and wait for him to fix himself up. Perhaps the counseling could rebuild trust -- but how could I ever feel proud of being with him anymore? How could I feel when he compliments me, that it's not another line coming out of his Box of Flattery for girls? How can I know that he won't attempt to outsmart me and do it again?

What should I do? He claimed he cancelled the tickets one day before. I said I'd only ever see him if he had proof he did since he's still been making little lies everywhere. He deleted so much of the incriminating evidence, he says, So you don't get upset (see how he lacks foresight? this obviously would just get me more mad) so now he doesn't have any electronic trail of it. He is trying to get an audio recording of his request to cancel so that he can be allowed to see me again.

Should I do couple's counseling? Should I try to give him another chance? Part of me wants a clean slate. Another part feel sad, and unsure of what would happen if I go back to him. We had good times. I don't know if it's possible anymore.

12436,Infidelity,37mdft,"We have been dating for 3 years. The first time I caught him doing anything was when he had screencapped pictures of girls we both know irl on instagram. I confronted him, told him how upset I was, and then discovered he looks at a bunch of girls we know on facebook during times he tells me he is going to bed. After fighting he said he would delete it. Well the next day he had made a fake one and I saw it on his phone. Fighting ensued and he deleted that one too. Still snooping, I find a Kik. He had pretended to be a girl to get nudes from other girls.


Fast forward through the years I've found him looking up girls we know again. But what really bothers me is that he downloaded kik again for a second time. He only keeps the kik active for like 2, or 3 days so it's not a permanent thing.


Well I finally thought it was over, until a couple of weeks ago I saw he downloaded Omegle, chat room apps and kik. He says he never used it this time. He says it's only for masturbating, and isn't actually trying to talk to these girls for anything else. He doesn't seem to think more of it than that and doesn't seem to actually empathize with me since he's done it multiple times. I've told him I don't care if he looks at porn but it really hurts my feelings thinking he needs to talk to another girl or get nudes sent because even though he doesn't know them irl, I feel like it's  kind of like cheating without really having to go out and do it??? Or at least he does it because he desires other women.


He really is the best guy I could ask for other than that and this occurence happens randomly after a couple of months of being fine, it's just when I decide to snoop I find something. I'm just so hurt and confused and I feel so irrational at this point.

12437,Relationships,3azp2c,"So, a little backstory, not trying to go too in detail.

I'm currently typing this to the sound of the girl I consider the love of my life sleeping with slow soft breaths, and I'm lost in a train of thought.

We first fell for each other in March of last year, and it happened really quickly, she's the first girl I actually fell for, and before that I was a less than respectable person when it came to relationships. That being said - she's my first love - and I'll do whatever I can to find my way back to her.

We have also an amazing friendship, we've been close friends since day one, plans of spending the rest of our lives together regardless of relationship status (which are in motion), including the darker parts of our lives.

On that note, a major concern is that she has severe borderline personality disorder and RTS(rape trauma syndrome for those who don't know), she goes from being extremely attached and overly happy and affectionate to extremely depressed and haunted by night terrors and the like, and was battling a very heavy drug addiction for two years as a result of these, but on the 15th of January with the support of everyone around her she's finally completely clean.

Anyway...

We've slowly since then brought ourselves to a point where we're spending all of our free time together again, whether it's with friends or alone, all that. She's afraid of relationships because of her instability with relationships due to her personality disorder, but everyone including all of our best friends and family (and myself, obviously) want to see us in an actual committed relationship.

When we spend our time together is the happiest I see her, regardless of what we're doing, and it's the same for me. Aside from working and school, we're always together every waking second of the day, and maybe it's silly but the title of an official relationship is something I usually completely disregard, but with her I hold it with pride, and I want that back.

I'm fully convinced that now that we've both gotten through the hard parts of our lives and have each other back again fully, that we can make a legitimate romantically invested relationship work, we've sworn that the next time we got together there would not be a breaking up (which isn't really saying anything because we're involved regardless of a relationship status).

She said a few months ago she's scared and not ready for a relationship, and I'm not going to push her, but I want it to happen eventually and I still want to talk to her about it, but I don't know how.

* **tl;dr:**

My best friend and I have an amazing relationship, we're closer than we've ever been with anyone else, we spend every waking second of our days together and every night asleep together, and we constantly find ourselves falling for each other, whether we're single or with other people (which I understand is not exactly a good thing, but it's not intentional), and the past few years we've had people constantly call us soulmates in a semi-joking fashion and we believe it, but she says she's not ready for a legitimate relationship. I don't want to push it, but I do want to know how I can talk to her about it to see if she'd be willing to put more thought into it.","Myself [20M] and my best friend [17F] have had an on-again off-again relationship, trying to get her focused on the on part, and keep it that way.",0.0,False,1.0,3.0,1435176922.0,/r/relationships/comments/3azp2c/myself_20m_and_my_best_friend_17f_have_had_an/,Romantic

Tldr: Co-parenting, difficult children, baggage from previous relationships.. Is this the end, is that perfect future together gone, and would it be so terrible to give up custody in exchange for that?

So anyway, I met this girl last spring and we quickly fell for each other. She has an 8 year old boy who is the very definition of ADHD, it's unreal, but he's also incredibly smart, working well above his grade level and he's always been quick to learn, according to his mom she never did anything with him as far as teaching him to read or take care of himself, he just picked up on things and started doing it. His dad has always been nonexistent. This woman, Beth, is very independent. Her past relationships can be described as self preservation, they were either very casual to suit her needs, or ended when she refused to put up with drama. She also has bipolar and has struggled with it in the past, but is very self aware and keeps herself in check well, lately she credits me for inspiring her to stay on top of her moods/meds so she doesn't damage our relationship in anyway. When I met her she had just came out from a relationship with a guy who was very wishy washy and unconcerned about most things, especially her and that drove her crazy. He'd say all the right things then dissapear for a day or two. So when I came along she was more appreciative of the attention and honesty. I also just came out of a less the stellar sitch and had a new no holds barred confidence. No expectations and blunt honesty was working well for me in the dating scene I just entered months prior. There was no school this time of year so, being single parents, our kids were basically living with their grandparents. That gave us a lot of alone time for our relationship to really take off, we meshed so well on our first date that we spent literally every day after that together. It may have only been months but it felt like we were made for each other, I don't know how to accurately describe that humble whole feeling. Either way, it's not our first time around the block, and this was something neither of us ever felt before, and even after discussing our disdain for marriage we ended up engaged and she moved in. Then school started. The kids still go to their grandparents on the weekend, and for those couple days me and Beth are alone life is perfect. But the kids have some major adjustment issues that make the rest of the week a living hell. Sure her son has a few issues having to always be on, he can be a know it all and in your face defiantly disagreeable. But my daughter is his exact opposite, which is where the struggle begins.

But first a quick summary of my daughter's mom. She was an alcoholic. She was often left with her while I worked, and often there would be drunken drama once I left. As alcohlics go, there were periods of sobriety, sneaking little drinks here and there would pick up in frequency and intensity until something dramatic would happen that caused her to go to rehab or a mental health place. I always just fell for her promises that it was the last time, I just wanted to live a normal life. Eventually that wore on me, I was falling out of love, or whatever that was, and I still held on to hope that the normal life could be achieved for my daughter's sake. Until the last time, almost two years ago, when there was some clingy drunken squeezing that led to police and my daughter telling them that she couldn't breathe and was scared, which led to an arrest. Which led to a custody battle I won hands down. My daughter is in therapy, they say maybe her issues learning and doing things on her own is due to ptsd making her withdrawn, I having trouble believing that because I don't think she thinks enough about anything at all to have anxiety. Her mom has spent the last six months in a halfway house following her graduation from rehab, has a job, and is now seeking modification of the op and visitation arrangement, which was previously denied. Moving on..

My daughter is a grade below her son, they're about a year apart in age. And while he's in second grade reading at a fourth grade level, she just barely learned her alphabet. She's scraping by the bottom rung in her grade. Her memory retention is barely discernible, which makes it nearly impossible to teach her and incredibly frustrating and discouraging. Not just academically, she has trouble figuring out things in all aspects of life, always waiting for somebody to either do it for her, or help her, or tell her. She's not even aware of it, none of it, she's a complete airhead. When she was 4 or 5 that was one thing but she's getting to the age now where she should be able to be a little self sufficient I'd think. I don't know how kids that age are supposed to progress, can't compare her to Beth's son cause he's on another level, and the school's just say she isn't as bad as other kids. So here we are pushing on a brick wall, repeating the same lessons in her homework every night, getting frustrated and annoyed, and then we still have to tell her to sound out her th sounds, to brush her hair before school, to put a towel on the floor when she takes a shower, day after day after day. 

Me and Beth, between both kids and work, are stressed out to no end and my daughter just seems hopeless. There's been death in the family, uprooting of children, endless work related stress, and kids on top. We're miserable. Beth said she has never been so patient and caring in her life, and she gets back nothing, no progress. She didn't realize it'd be so trying emotionally. The negativity, frustration, and general unhappiness of everybody due to this issue is a time bomb that will destroy the family we're trying to create. Beth tells me tonite, she won't live this way, she won't continue to be so miserable everyday for the next decade. I either need to find some other way to fix all this or let her mother take her back, either there needs to be some kind of improvement in the next few months or she's leaving and the wedding is off. I don't even know what to say. When put bluntly I know most people would be like, don't choose a woman over your daughter, but come on, people's lives aren't that simple. Like I said we've spent the last year of lives trying to create a family. There's unfathomable amounts of emotion vested in this, the house, everything, has a part of us both in it. Our lives are thoroughly entwined, and this constant stress is breaking one of us apart, and it's my mess taking a toll on the whole house. I know it's common, that a lot of couples don't survive these kind of things, regardless if the end up in seperation, and it's heartbreaking for all them. What is it really worth? What is all the trouble, stress, frustration, dissapointments, exhaustion, hopelessness, heartbreak, what is it all worth, and what kind of parent would either of us be overwhelmed by all those things. Any tiny milestones or improvements are unseen or overshadowed by all the negativity. Would it really be so bad to let her go back to her mother? If it isn't just her being an airhead or a hard learner and it is all because of ptsd why shouldn't her mom be the one to pick up those pieces. I mean, am I just doing all this because it's the right thing to do, and is it really, cause I seem to care less and less.

12439,Relationships,35vivf,"My girlfriend and I have been together for around 8 months. Things are great, I think we make a really good match. We are the same age and have similar outlooks on a lot of areas. We always have fun together when going places or just hanging out around the house. I think we both appreciate our own space but we do see each other maybe 2/3 times a week.

Most times we see each other though, I feel that my arousal can often get the better of me. Most times we are together, even if I'm not particularly horny before we meet, I become aroused as we spend time together throughout the day or evening. By the time we go to bed, sometimes I can't even think straight and I feel that the arousal kind of 'takes over' my mind; I become distracted, I can't think straight and I can't focus on conversation - I become anxious about sex, whether I am doing enough to get her in the mood or whether I should calm down.

One morning recently we were talking about this together and discussed about how although we do both enjoy sex together, she doesn't often have the energy or interest for it more than once a week whereas I would happily have sex more often than that. She says that I make her feel worried and pressured; worried that I will want to have sex when we see each other and that she won't want to, so she doesn't kiss or hug me as often as we both might like, incase she gives me the wrong idea. She said that sometimes I make her feel that a kiss should lead to sex, when it doesn't necessarily always do so. I felt quite guilty when she said all of this, it made me feel like I was acting like a child about sex which made me feel uncomfortable. She said that I can often become grumpy or curt when we don't have sex, which made me feel embarrassed. When we discussed this, I told myself that I would try to find ways to not let my arousal get the better of me and make things uncomfortable between us. I suppose there is a part of me that feels that as a man, I feel pressure to be the initiator, I think societies depictions of men is that they make sex happen, it's up to us to arouse our partners and if not, we're doing a bad job - I guess maybe that's where this come from?

We are talking about moving in together later this year. Obviously if we were to spend each night together after work, I don't want this to continue to be uncomfortable for either of us. I value our relationship and obviously I would like things to continue, but I am worried that this could become a bigger issue over time. 

What can I do about this? Is it entirely up to me to change how I act when I want sex and my partner doesn't? Am I blaming myself too much? Am I looking at this the wrong way?

I am quite the romantic and sometimes soppy, perhaps a little over-affectionate at times. I feel like I need affection from my partner to feel loved, is that okay? Am I asking too much?

12440,Relationships,3ac7yw,"Hi Reddit! 

The title is a bit misleading, sorry!
I have *severe* emetophobia. I've had this problem for years. In a way, I have PTSD: I retain vivid memories of puke... times I've done it, times I've seen it... from the time my dad ate too much before a trip to Lake Tahoe, to the scene in *Requiem for a Dream*, when Marion experiences heavy withdrawals. YouTube eating challenges and Family Guy are the bane of my existence. 

Basically, anything can trigger me. The smell, the sound, the sight. Sometimes, I can shrug it off, but sometimes, it hits me and it hits me *hard*. The mere mention of vomit has once sent me to tears. I give myself hard pinches to ignore nausea. 

Now, with that said... I embrace my irrational fear. It's like having a big nose. It's okay. As an example, back when non-heterosexuality was a major source of stress and depression (and not nearly as supported as it is today), many homosexuals refused religious cleansing. I feel the same way with my phobia; I've had therapy to aid it, but I have no intention of getting rid of it. 


My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. He is who I'd love to be with in the future. My only major issue with him is that he has a weak stomach. He is a light-weight drinker, frequently gets the stomach flu, is highly susceptible to food poisoning, and typically cannot eat large portions of food in one sitting. I had previously been with a boy who had a stomach of steel, who never once triggered my emetophobia. My current boyfriend vomits as often as once every two months. I have motherly instincts--I love taking care of him when he is sick--so when he is throwing up, I am both miserable and affectionate at the same time. I've had to care for him when he was drunk and dry heaving. Just yesterday he got sick after eating uncooked beef... I had a full-blown panic attack and locked myself away from human contact. 
I should also mention that his lungs are not particularly strong and his coughs (which are frequent) sound like gagging. 

**I cannot stress enough that this is the *only* major issue I have with him.** 


I love spending time with him and I love social events, so opting out of college parties and seafood restaurants is NOT an option. Even when I remove myself from a room when I anticipate him vomiting, the thought of it engulfs me and drives me insane, and I inevitably become triggered, even if I'm not directly exposed to anything.

I know that this is ultimately my issue, and not his fault at all, but like I said, I have friends and ex-boyfriends who are not *nearly* as prone to vomiting as he is. Don't get me wrong, he is very considerate of my phobia; he avoids mentioning it and always scouts the area for potential accidents (so he can cover my ears or find an excuse to lead me out of a room without having me worry). He is amazing, and I love him. I just don't love his bodily reactions. I don't want him to hold it in, though. As Shrek once said, Better out than in!, and I agree with him. I personally hold in my vomit because vomiting myself affects me 5x worse than witnessing it, and I'd much rather experience slight body damage than severe mental and emotional scarring. Please help me, and please don't suggest therapy (been there, *doing* that). Please don't also lecture me about drinking: we last drank in Canada, where it is legal. Sorry for the giant wall of text, I bet you guys thought it'd be another cheating/familial issues post.

12441,Infidelity,30qosp,"***Hello all. I copied this from a post I made earlier today in another subreddit and was directed here. Everything was typed on a phone so please excuse any bad grammar, spelling, etc. And no, the ages aren't typos.***

So today is the third day after I got broken the bad news. I think the only reason I'm up early is because the booze wore off quicker than the night before.

Let's start with that day. I should have known something was up because she sucked me to completion that morning. She very rarely touches me on her own accord and I don't know why alarms weren't screaming in my face. After that we got up and started making breakfast together and talking about our usual topics: about how I never listen, about how I need to find a job, about how I never pay attention to her.
Let me back up just a little bit more to get some closure. Earlier this year we both moved in with my mother in law and she's only charging us $200 a month for rent for the both of us, pretty much just to offset the added costs of utilities of two extra people. Of course I'm supposed to find a job so I start doing some transcriptioning work. It doesn't pay a hell of a lot but if I bust my ass I can make like $150 a week for working roughly 30-40 hours a week. It's not ideal but I get to stay at home and work in my pj's. I literally can set my own hours. It's great! Yea it's only pocket money but I'm fine with that for now, especially after giving up an almost $19/hr job to go work with my dad and get paid in room, board, and beer.

Rolling back to the quasi present, after breakfast we went outside for our usual morning toke. All the anxiety and aggressions melted away and I wanted nothing better than to hold her and have some morning canoodling. Well then she asks about the status of our open marriage (we tried it but both agreed to squash it until I was actually able to pick up women), to which I reminded her that we put the breaks on it until women would actually be interested in me and not be disgusted by my image. That's when she dropped the bomb. She asked how I felt if something already happened?

You want to know how I felt? I was sky high, ground control to major Tom style, and when those words left her lips my rocket ship buried several thousand leagues deep in to the Earth. I felt all the color drain from my face and I shut down like a worker droid. Meanwhile she's trying to get me to see the silver linings, the positive of everything, about how I need to forgive her. I don't blame her for being that way because that's just how she is, always finding the good in bad people and using your words positively so the universe wouldn't react to our negativity and then manifest our intentions (I'll elaborate later if you guys want)

Of course there's lots of thoughts I'm thinking and of course the most pounding question was who it was. She was helping her friend move out of his place for the past few days so I thought it was him. Nope. It happened about a week ago. At a party, while drunk, with one of my friends. Well, it's like a mutual friend but he's still my friend. The same friend who almost got in to a fist fight with his other friend because he had the audacity to sleep with his sister. I guess he had no qualms about fucking my wife. I'm such a fucking beta because I didn't tell him I'm going to beat the shit out of him, I just said I was severely disappointed.

After this bomb, I began to pack up a bag and am currently bunked in with my brother from another mother for a few days to cool off. She's trying to tell me that she did it because she was unhappy, because I don't do the foreplay (which is bullshit because I did that shit for a long time before I stopped being the initiator), telling me I've cheated on her with video games (bitch, smack that controller out of my hands and pin me to the bed), pretty much telling me it's my fault she cheated on me in the literal.

I think the only reason she is saying sorry is because I didn't immediately forgive her and I'm actually acting pretty rational otherwise. Thing is, I can't stop thinking about how much I still love her. My heart says yes but my brain says no.

Sorry if this isn't cohesive. It sounds all right in my head

12442,Relationships,38f0pe,"A bit of background on her:

She currently lives with her boyfriend, who she got back together after he cheated on and abandoned her. (It was him who wanted to get back together). She is quite obviously attracted to me (signs, some quite detailed FB sexting, her telling me she finds me desirable etc) but the problem is she got together with her ex just a few days before I started hitting on her (FML right?). 

We went out together for like an hour or so and she felt guilty, because she wanted to do more than just walk together(she told me she wanted to kiss me a lot), so she told me she is unsure whether she wants to meet anymore because of the way it makes her feel like she is the cheater now and that is not the kind of person she is (yes, she isnt a cheater, she is super kind person, which is part of the reason im falling for her so hard right now and a big reason why I respect her).

The complication is that they live in an apartment they lived in together for 3 years, something they built together so she feels really close with the place and perceives it as her home (she had to move out when they broke up), which leads me to thinking that part of the reason she got back with him is the aparment (she told me she doesnt feel as confident in the relationship and that she in unsure whether that is the kind of relationship she wants).

So far all the signs are there and I can see the conflict in her. I even asked her to be with me so she doesnt have to feel guilty anymore, to which she replied that it is not so easy and that she doesnt want to move again (the first time she told me she lived with him, before this I only knew she got back with her ex).

A bit of background on me:

I would say that I am attractive, I have no troubles getting dates in club,I work out a lot and I work outside so I have a bit of tan. I would say that I am currently in best shape I ever was, and she is without a doubt physically attracted to me.

This is probably the hardest I've ever worked for a girl, but I feel she is worth it, she may even be The One. There is a lot of chemical attraction between us, she is super smart , cute and kind. The kind of girl you want to be with no matter what it takes. The worst part for me is that I can't stop thinking about her, I have to force myself not to write to her on FB every few minutes and everytime I am not chatting her up I wish I was chatting her up. But due to the nature of the relationship it is taking quite a toll on me. I am moody, I feel powerless, frustrated and all I want to do is to be with her, hug her, wake up next to her and everything else...I dont think I've ever felt anything this intense.

So what I need advice for from you guys, is how do I persuade her to drop the loser who cheated , abandoned and most definitely isnt worthy of her to be with me? She admitted she wants me but I cant figure out why she just wont drop him. Could it be the apartment or something else? I know cheaters gonna cheat etc... but I feel this is way too important for me to try and wait it out and hope he screws up again. What is there in my power to do? I thought of telling her that this kind of relationship is taking heavy toll on me and that we should probably stop with it for a while or even stop altogether, but I cant just think about it as it makes me feel physically bad.

What is there to do? What can and what should I do? Should I stop texting her so much? What if the relationship grows cold because of that and she settles back into her old life. Her BF may screw up again, but I wouldn't bet on it.

**tl;dr:** A girl I like and hit on got back with her ex who cheated on her and abadoned her. She wants me but she feels awkward and guilty when she is with me because she feels like she is cheating and that is not the kind of girl she is. They live together in an apartment they created together over 3 years and she thinks of it as home. When I asked her to be with me she said that it isnt so simple and that she doesnt want to move again. I figure she bonded with the apartment for some reason, perhaps because it was her first and she has done a lot of work on it.How do I get her to be with me?

5 years ago, I met the guy who would become my first love and first serious relationship. We dated for a year and a half, broke up for a year, dated for another year, and finally broke up last year. I've had other flings and relationships yet here I am, still completely in love with him, and dude has moved on (can't blame him). Obviously this relationship was in no way stable/healthy and it's in both our best interests that it ended.

When I dated in the past I always felt like while I cared a lot about the new guy, I kind of knew that if my ex were to ask I would take him back in a heartbeat. Ex has recently let me know he no longer has feelings for me (good for him!). I still do. We met today for the first time since our breakup last year and while I thought I was in the right space to finally have a friendship with him, seeing him proved to be extremely painful and now I'm back to square one. I am finally realizing there is no way I can keep this person in my life and it breaks my heart all over again whenever I think about it.

I often idealize him but really I know we're just two ordinary people who didn't work out. Nothing special.

I've been married to my husband for 8 years. We were the cute story you hear about... I was the class president, popular, overachiever girl, he was the nerdy/hot guy who comes off as an asshole 'til you get to know him.. We ended up Prom King and Queen and married later on. He was amazingly sweet... So nice to me! I'm super easy going, don't ask for much in a relationship. Early on before marriage when discussing relationship stuff, I told him I didn't want my significant other watching porn. I'm not jealous, I'm hot as hell, no need to be. I was just raised very old fashioned and I find it disrespectful. I made this clear very early on. Serious conversation. He told me no problem he doesn't even watch it. (If you are going to comment with everyone does... go fuck yourself. Statistically that is not true. Different strokes for different folks.) Anyways, a couple years after we married I caught him doing it and told him no bueno, he knew what I thought about that from the get go. Ain't nothing changed but the name. He assured me no biggie, doesn't want to hurt me... Won't happen again. Etcetera 



It happened one or two more times after that that I called him on. He had done it more than that but those two occasions I made it known I knew. (Side note, I'm very tech savvy. Went to school for Computer Science and I can find anything, incognito or not.) He had lied repeatedly to me and hid it. I told him I have not changed my stance and wasnt going to... That if it happened again I would leave. I'm too young to live my life with someone who lies to me and hides things. Add this to the fact the guy barely messes with our 5 yr old kid, comes straight home from work and gets on the computer til he goes to bed to do it all over the next day. He doesn't take out the trash or do anything else and if I don't wash his clothes he will legit go to work nasty and just not wash them. Yeah....attractive,eh?    ... but I love him... 8 years man. EIGHT YEARS!!!! I also moved thousands of miles from home to be with him to a place I hate. I digress... 



He hasn't been having sex with me for a few months... Like at all. I'm super horny. I want it. He's not giving it. A few times a week I wear stockings/garter belts, show a little cleavage, fix up some sexy hair and I'm a makeup pro. Dudes turn their heads all the time, he tells me I'm so sexy he wants me etc then..... Boom... Nothing. Asked what's up and he says he just doesn't have drive, he's been having a lot of anxiety etc. Little later noticed his phone was using a lot of data, mentioned it and he said it must be Spotify.... I know the difference between data usage for streaming music and videos...



Now being super sleuth me, (not really super, kidding folks) I decided to check out his Chrome... No history entries but a few. Go to phone data manager and a huge majority of data was used by Chrome. Check data usage times and dates. Start adding things up. Use other methods to find what the data is being used for...



Confronted him, he admitted he has been looking at NAKED FUCKING CARTOONS! HENTAI! And some regular porn thrown in for good measure. I'm seriously the least judgmental ever when it comes to sexual things. As long as you respect each other's boundaries you're fine with me. For real... I don't care if you like FUCKING trees... Go you. But yeah, that one was a surprise. He always said he thought that was really weird.



That's not even the disturbing part though. Turns out he has been lying to me for over a year and hiding it AND get this... he has watched porn while driving home from work, DRIVING!!!!, and his work is like 3 minutes from being home with me, and he could have me. (We also live on a government installation with a large police presence and if something like that happened in public and he got caught he could be in huge trouble with his job... Not just Oh you're fired trouble... Huge trouble. ) Then he comes in and goes to the computer to game. He's also done it while sitting in the parking lot at his work too, side note, there is a kids play center right across the street. Kids ride their bikes by there all the time. The what ifs make me sick. Also what if someone passed him on the road and their kids saw him? Plus he has when he told me he was going to bed early instead of FUCKING me. He says he's not even jacking off... Just watching it. WHAT THE FLYING FUCK?????  He keeps saying sorry, sorry I fucked up. I have a problem, don't leave me etc etc. He does. His problem is he is fucked up and he needs help. 

 

Everyone tells him how lucky he is to have landed such a hottie like me. He always acted like I was the best, sexiest thing alive. He was so sweet and kind and never would have hurt me for the world. I feel like I was duped into marrying him and he has always been this way. What the fuck did I get myself into?



 I know everyone is just going to say he has an addiction blah blah blah. Not my problem. I was upfront from the beginning. He should have been too. He continues to lie and lie and lie until I show him proof and then he changes his story. He can't tell the truth to save his life. I don't want someone to tell me I need to stay with him while he gets help or any of that shit. I didn't sign up for that. 



TL:DR;Husband doesn't do anything around house, doesn't interact with kid, won't fuck his hot wife and lies and hides porn. Faked his way to marrying her and now wants her to stay with his lying ass.

12450,Relationships,26k2a6,"A little history on me: I have had anxiety issues my whole life, and have had multiple suicide attempts. They are mostly aggravated during times of insane stress. SO was aware of this. 

A little history of him: SO shuts down when faced with huge stressful situation, mostly due to a seriously unhealthy family dynamic. We've been able to get through this before but this time is different...

We have been together for two years, and we were engaged. He's being sent to basic training for the Air Force in August and I was going to go with him to his station after Tech School. 

What built up to my snap: My family (I'm the oldest of 9 kids) had been under pre-evacutation due to a fire since Tuesday. My family doesn't handle stress very well so this has caused a great deal of panic in my household and I've been bearing a lot of it because I'm the oldest child. This happened the day after the condom broke when my SO and I had sex on Monday, and I didn't tell him about it because I thought my birth control pills would take care of it. I lost the birth control the day of the pre-evac warning because of the panic packing. 
On that same day! A random guy I have never met before came and told me he saw my SO flirting and getting handsy with another girl at his school. I didn't talk to my SO about it then because I wanted more information, and I didn't really believe it. It was still a big stress-bringer, however, because I am insecure about myself. 

What happened: 
On Friday, I was supposed to go spend the day with my SO. And as I was five minutes from his house he told me we weren't supposed to, he didn't know about this, and his family was overriding it anyway so it wasn't going to happen and basically said I was lying about spending the day together and so on. So I snapped. I said I was done, I said I was going to pick up my shit from his house and that was it. And during said snap, I said a lot of things I hadn't addressed with him before. Like how I felt like I was his mother in this relationship, I'm tired of moving my life around constantly for him, I said I didn't trust him because of the cheating thing, and I just couldn't take it anymore.

I got to his house, and things got nastier. A lot of it was made up out of anger. Like how he wished he hadn't asked me out two years ago. How I wished I had never fucked him. How we regretted each other. And it ended with him throwing both our rings away. I left, and we were both angry.

About an hour later I completely lost it and regretted everything I said. I tried apologizing, and he rejected it all. And Because of my anxiety issues I worked myself into a state of panic and suicide. Which I told him. And I told him I needed his help. He agreed to meet me a few hours later. Meet up happened, even more angry things were said, I asked about working things out. I asked if he still loved me. He said he loves me an wants me, the emotional drama is just a lot to handle. I am seeking professional help and I told him that. REALLY BAD REASON HE WON'T GET BACK TOGETHER: He feels his parents will reject him or force us apart if he goes back and tells them we got back together, because now they hate me. I panicked, I said he can't leave me and I need him. And he ended up literally running away because he couldn't handle the stress. 

I did attempt suicide when I got home, it failed. He knows this as well, if he's checked his phone. And once I realized I was stuck on this planet I panicked even more and started apologizing left and right. I know I hurt him and want to fix it. And I do love this boy more than anything. But every text and call has gone unresponded. For three days. He's never shut down this hard and it worries me immensely.

I told this story to four of our mutual best friends, they all tried contacting him and he didn't respond to them either. Even his grandfather reached out to me via Facebook, and I told him the story, and he wants to help us get back together as well. But my SO hasn't responded to him either. He DID, however, respond to one of my friends that my SO has hated forever, when he asked if he was okay. He responded and said he was fine, then blocked my friend. 

I am at a loss for what to do. I haven't eaten in four days. I've barely slept since it happened. I'm trying to control my anxiety as best I can, I'm getting professional help really soon, and so that will be taken care of. But I don't know how to get through to him. I don't know if I can. I do love him, more than anything. And really, most of the things I said that bothered me about the relationship are things that can be fixed. They just sounded like attacks when I exploded because of all the stress, and I don't know how to explain that either. 

So really...I just don't know how to fix this. Can I fix it? Did I screw up too much? How can I at least have him meet with me and a mediator so we can work on this? He says he still loves me but his parents are in the way. How do I fix that as well?

12454,Infidelity,1xmokh,"Back story: I was married for six years and found out my wife cheated on me. I found all the emails where her friends for months convinced her I had to be cheating on her because I was in the Navy and away. They eventually convinced her to start seeing one of their mutual friends. I couldn't forgive her. I kicked her out the minute I found out and told her her belongings would be in a box on the porch the next day.

I dated for two years and despite going on a lot of dates never really found anyone worth having more than a second date with. Eventually, I met my fiancée now. When I met her she was leaving a 3.5-4 year relationship. The guy was bad news, he beat her, mistreated her and cheated on her. When he found out we were dating he stocked her and threatened to kill me. We've been together about a year and in December I proposed to her. I have never been so happy with someone in my life. We get along really well and have only gotten into a few arguments about petty things. We had one really bad argument after I proposed where I told her maybe she should just find someone else. I was on Tren a hardcore steroid at the time and would go through periods where I didn't care about anything. The argument was because she was smoking and she was supposed to quit for me when we got engaged. She quit the year prior to get her breasts done. I was upset because I felt like she cared more about getting her breasts done than her relationship with me.

Fast forward to last Thursday. After the issue we had in December was resolved our relationship started picking back up and has been better than ever (I stopped using tren after that night). After a whole day of her telling me how happy she is I let her know that the last few weeks have been some of the happiest of my life. She started crying after I told her that and confessed that she had cheated on me. I broke down, told her to not to touch me and get away from me. She cheated on me with her ex. The worst person she could have cheated on me with. I put the pieces together and told my friend about it. He said he felt like there was more to it and when she got home from work I should ask her to confess everything. The plan was to make her pull up her phone bill online. Then I could see if she had deleted anything. She told me that she had actually cheated three times total and two of them were before we got engaged. The third was when we had gotten into the argument in December.

I have no doubt she loves me but now I'm in a situation where I cant trust her. We swore to each other to go to counseling before we broke up and thats where this is heading now. She's going to pay for it and that's a huge chunk of her income. 

I'm 28 now and dont want to go through anything like this again. I know she feels bad, she's been crying hysterically for days now. I took her ring back when I found out about the other two times.

I'm really looking for some biased advice. People in my social circle (ive only told my best friend about it and dont plan on telling anyone else) would just say things like, once a cheater always a cheater. 

I'm a good looking successful guy so I know I can find someone else. She makes me happy though and I've honestly never had feelings for anyone like this before.

12455,Breakups,252enc,"this is my first post on here, or anywhere to be exact. so here goes.

about a month ago, my girlfriend and i broke up. after about a year and a half of being with her, i kind of neglected the relationship a little. i stopped doing the cute things i used to do with her among various things. there were times where she wanted to hang out but i would be busy doing something or with friends, so i pushed her away.


after some time, i began to realize my mistakes and started missing her more, wanting to be with her more. the distance i put in front made my heart grow fonder. but i think it was too late, she became distant, cold and just seemed like she wasn't all there. we eventually broke up and for the first two weeks i tried getting her back, i spilled my heart out for her, but i ultimately ended up getting rejected she said i think i need time to be single for awhile, i need to learn to be independent again, i dont want to depend on people for my happiness


the biggest thing i believe caused the cracks is the fact i've wanted to join the US Marine Corps for the longest time, she doesn't think she can handle that. i even offered to let go of that ambition if it meant staying with her. to me she was worth it. but that didn't work out, obviously


i never really got closure on it because she went back and forth on how maybe we'll be together someday so i decided that it probably just isnt going to happen. i told myself that i just need to move on with my life and begin to re-educate myself on how to be a single person again. and i've been okay, until now.


lately, i've had not ambition or will to do anything. i no longer enjoy video games, hanging with friends can be fun, but they can't offer the love i want, whenever i go out if i see a car that looks like her's my heart just sinks, even if it really isnt her. i feel like i've lost the will to do anything. mind you, this a month after the initial break-up. but i just don't know what to do, i felt like i was doing okay. but now, im constantly in pain. like, whenever i get on facebook and she's tagged in something, in a picture, whatever the case may be, i feel like a piece of me dies a little. it's hard to explain as this is only the second time i've experienced this. basically, if it has anything to do with her. i instantly feel like hell. there is probably a lot to the story i left out, my mind is everywhere right now. so if you need more detail, i can try to give you some.


i feel like im drowning here. and i don't know how to make it back to the surface so i can breathe again. anyone have any advice to at least make this a little easier? is this part of the process or am i just going back? i feel so lost.

12457,Relationships,2fyb33,"I honestly thought I would never post here, but here we are.  I could use some advice and perspective, because I feel like I'm not being very objective.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about 14 months.  We share an apartment and a dog.  Things moved quickly between us, but this is the best relationship I've ever had in terms of chemistry, compatibility, common interests/goals, and a deep connection.  He's very good at expressing his love for me and meeting my needs.  I hope to marry him eventually.

Obviously, since he's a few years older, he has quite a few ex-relationships under his belt (and is much more experienced sexually as well).  I don't have a problem with any of that, since we both try to focus on the here-and-now and I know he loves me.  His last relationship before me only lasted for around 6-8 months, and they broke up due to distance, since they had been introduced at a wedding and she lived in a different country.

We agreed early on in the relationship (once we became exclusive) that it makes life less complicated to maintain no contact with ex significant others/sexual partners as much as possible.  It wasn't something that either of us felt pressured into, it was more of a mutual policy that we were already trying to implement individually anyway.

Despite that rule, over the course of the last couple years I'd had some issues with a former male friend who had been very overzealous about getting my attention for a long time.  Eventually it made both my boyfriend and myself uncomfortable (despite numerous discussions), and I decided not to speak with that friend when at all possible (I occasionally have to, due to some shared obligations) and I agreed that I would tell my boyfriend whenever I had a conversation with the ex-friend, just to keep him in the loop, which I've done faithfully, even informing him about text messages, etc, in keeping with our agreement.

So that leads us to the present.  A few days ago my boyfriend and I were on a trip together that was outside of cell phone range, so we couldn't check messages for a couple of days.  When we got service back, we were both going through our phones, and I saw a look of surprise come across his face.  I immediately asked him if something was wrong, and he said that everything was fine.  I let it go.

Later, on the drive home from that trip, I saw a strange number pop up on his phone (which we were using to play music, and I was DJ).  It looked like an international number (his ex-girlfriend is from a different country) and since I had a friend that lived in that country, I recognized the area code.  I asked him if he recognized the number and wanted me to answer it, and he said no to both.

It didn't hit me until a couple of days later that it might have been her.  I eventually asked him, and he admitted that it was a possibility.  He also said that she had called him at his work a month ago, and he had answered, not knowing it was her.  She told him that she was getting married but was unhappy with her relationship.  He told her that while he wanted her to be happy (or something similar), that he was in a relationship, and that he felt it was inappropriate for her to be calling him.  Apparently she apologized and they ended the call.

Then, he said that she had sent him a strange email while we were on vacation, saying SOS, I really need to talk to you, which had surprised him, since he had thought that they had said everything they needed to say to each other.  When he emailed her back to make sure she was okay, she apparently said everything was fine, and started asking him about where we had gone, etc, which he responded to.  Apparently she also said something about getting divorced.

Here's my problem with this -- first, he didn't tell me about the phone call a month ago.  He says that he didn't want to upset me and thought he could handle it on his own, and then never speak to her again.  I get that it can be awkward to talk about ex-relationships, but we usually discuss everything, and I'm VERY open about all my conversations with the people that make him uncomfortable in my life, and that type of disclosure is something that he's requested and expected of me.  It feels strange to me that he didn't tell me about something similar going on with him.

Secondly, I don't like that he continued to email her after telling her it was inappropriate for them to be speaking, especially after she made it pretty clear that she was unhappy in her current relationship and extending a thinly-veiled proposition.  The SOS email doesn't make me feel better about her intentions, and he admits that she was probably manipulating him into responding to her through an OMG it's an emergency sort of message.  

Honestly, I don't feel like he should have responded to her email at all.  Even if it WAS an emergency, he claims they haven't spoken in over a year (except for that one call).  What is he supposed to do if she's in trouble?  It's not his responsibility, which I told him.

(It also doesn't endear me to his ex-girlfriend that I found out a few months after we started dating that he had given me gonorrhea, presumably from her.  He said he was clean, and I was stupid).

He told me he wouldn't respond if she tried to contact him again, but since he's taken the bait once, I'm afraid he will again.  Am I being naive about this situation?  Is it normal to respond if an ex sends out a distress call?  Should I be concerned that he didn't tell me?  What do I tell him?

Before we became something we had been friends for about 1 year and a half. But then I started to feel something for him and I denied it for months until I couldn’t hold it anymore and told him.

But he doesn’t know what to do.



I love him so so so much. I don’t want to lose him. He says he does still like me, hat he doesn’t want to stop talking. So I don’t know what to do. How can I show him he can still love me like before or even more than before? I know I’ve messed up big time and I have expressed myself about that and told him that I will work on being better.

12459,Relationships,2j3nik,"Hi Everyone,

This isn't necessarily a specific question about me and my relationship but more so how others feel about their own SO going out clubbing.

A little information about me and my SO will probably help. We've been a couple for around 3 months now and had been dating for a couple of months prior to that. We both understand that it is still very early days but both care about each other immensely and want this to work out for the long term. It's probably important to note that we're each others first serious relationship so are both still learning how to be in a relationship etc. 

At the moment we see each other around 3 times a week, we both have our own social lives, we both work and she goes to University. So whilst we are in a committed relationship we get that sense of freedom and our own personal time to do what we want, which I think is important.

Now this leads me on to my question, in a couple of weeks she is going clubbing with a few of her friends. I guess it's worth saying that all of her friends have long term boyfriends as well. I do trust her completely but I also understand what these places are like and what the people are like inside the clubs.

What I'd like to know is if it's ok for me just to talk to her before she goes and just explain that I do trust her, but that doesn't mean I won't worry and that I hope she has a good time but just to be careful. I worry about this as it may make her feel guilty for going or something like that. Or maybe it's just none of my business at all?

Really this isn't about me wanting to stop her going, but I'm just interested to see what other couple do in terms of clubbing and how you feel about your SO doing it because it's not a situation I've been in before.

We were friends of friends that occasionally saw each other here and there and we ended talking and deciding to go out. We've been on a couple of dates (but mostly hanging with mutual friends these past 2 months), but haven't committed to being a couple yet. Things are going really well, I'm pretty sure I like him a lot, and I can tell he's falling for me pretty hard.  

Earlier we'd just finished joking about his crazy ex when he shifted the tone to something more serious. He explained that he'd never felt any kind of long term potential with anyone else he'd met, but with me it was completely different. He's an awkward guy, but what he was saying seemed very genuine.

12461,Relationships,20ar70,"My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been dating for 7 months. We found out a few weeks ago that I was pregnant with our child. His family is very religious, while mine is very old-fashioned, so at that point we decided to get engaged and he proposed to me.

Now at this point I had no doubts about our relationship, but I did have doubts in the past. He once had a problem with drug addiction which he overcame, but when we first started dating and he was stressed he would drink constantly, too much, at odd hours and get ridiculously upset and break up with me. This hadn't happened for awhile though, so at the point we got engaged it wasn't a concern for me, and things were going quite well.

One night a week or so ago he flipped out, the same way he used to when we were dating. He broke up with me because I was too, emotionally distant and It was totally unexpected. I later found out he had blown a job interview he was very excited about because it meant he could provide for me and the baby, and had immediately started drinking very heavily.

He was extremely apologetic, and I told him I forgave him, but needed time to think. He totally did not give me that time, texting me several times a day for hours and hours, even at 4 in the morning while I was trying to sleep. He even left 5 vases of roses and a bunch of stuffed animals on my porch. At that point I just felt completely burnt out, I felt intruded upon, and had no incentive to try to fix things for the time being. 

Today he didn't text me at all like he usually would have. Then at about 5pm, he texted that he wanted to kill himself. I didn't take it seriously at first, because he's said things like that to me before and just been upset, but I understand he has tried to kill himself before. I texted him on and off for about three hours asking if he was okay. Finally I realized how much time had passed, and began calling him and he never answered. I texted him that I was calling the police if he didn't answer. The next couple of times I called, he answered, then hung up on me. 

This has literally been the most stressful night of my life. My family has been constantly bugging me to get back together with him, because he has a good future and cares and lot about me and the baby. I don't doubt that, and I know he is a good man who has always meant well and I don't intent to take him away from his child if that is what he wants, but I feel so overwhelmed I have no idea how to even proceed at this point. I want what's best for my baby, but I don't want to get back together with someone who has stressed me out to this degree. I feel guilty and wrong for rejecting him and putting him in this state when he's been so wonderful about the unexpected pregnancy. Am I being selfish?

12462,Dating,26utnu,"I'm a 22-year old female and my friend is a 24-year old male.  We both attend the same university and we're both going to graduate at the end of this spring quarter.  We weren't originally best friends; good friends, yes, but we didn't have the closeness that we have now until starting about a year ago.

Around this time one year ago, his ex-girlfriend broke up with him and he was really torn up about it.  I was surprised and kind of honored that I was one of the first few people he told before they decided to come out with the news.  A few months later at a beach trip, he pulled me to the side and confided in me that they had tied up all loose ends and now they were completely broken up.  He was really upset and I just hugged him and let him cry into my shoulder, rubbing his back and just trying to show him that I cared.  Since then we grew closer to the point where we became best friends; he confided in me and I confided in him.  He's also seen me during some of my worst moments.  We also became lovers, or rather friends with benefits, as much as I dislike the term.

It worked out for us.  Fast forward to now, we're both getting ready to graduate and we're busy with our respective Senior Projects.  I have some more bad moments but I try to get through them on my own and not have to worry or consult him about it, and he's doing what he does.  A few weeks ago I texted him just wondering how his day was and he brushed me off, while I just wanted to talk for a bit even though I know he's going to sleep in a few minutes.  I shrug it off to him just wanting some rest, but the next night when I come home from a family celebration and him from a friendly outing, we start a conversation and I don't remember how but it got to him talking about how I hang off of him like he's my boyfriend. I asked him if it bothered him and he said yes, and I didn't know how to really respond to that.  So I just said that I wouldn't do it anymore and I cut off our conversation there.

Starting next week after that conversation I see him hanging out with another girl, and I can tell that he likes her.  I instantly feel my heart getting crushed and at first I didn't know what it was.  After much thinking, talking with some other firends (and crying in solace because I'm probably bipolar), I've come to the conclusion that I like my friend.  But what hurts isn't that he likes another girl.

In the beginning of our newfound closeness, we had talked about being friends with benefits (again, that damn term) and had both stated that we didn't see each other that way.  Later on, we talked about being in a hypothetical relationship and how it wouldn't work out at the time.  Things change over the course of a year, and I realize that I really do like him.  I just don't know if I liked him that way from the beginning and refused to admit it until now, or if it just developed over time since we were so close.

I take my relationships and friendships seriously, and I told him in the very beginning that if there came a time when he did find someone he liked and wanted to be in a relationship with then he would tell me and I would know to back off.  Hell, I'd even play the wingman.  But now, it feels more like he's shoving me out of his life with the texts and with the statement.  He talked to me less and less before that, and I always attributed it to him being busy since he's a CIS major.

Right now I'm so angry and hurt that every time I see him I look away and don't acknowledge him unless spoken to, and even then I don't look at him and I respond in a very snappish way like I'm pissed off.  And I am, because all I asked for was a little honesty and now I fear I won't be able to salvage our friendship in time.

12463,Relationships,2h1ntn,"Hello, my girlfriend and I have been going out for 5 years, she never had alcohol consumption issue, but last night was a bit different.

She told me about 5 o'clock she was gonna go to her friend's house with her sister and few other friends. I paid it no mind, she always does this and never seem to have problems. Through out the day I received no text from her, lead me to believe that she went home because she was tired and passed out. I was wrong.

at 11pm, I texted her again to see if she could help me proofread my paper, all i got in response was drunk text, so i knew, something was up. Then i called her and ask hey... where are you? and i heard was mumbles so i ask her the same question again and the same response was given. At this point, i started to get very angry and insisted that she tells me where i was... my exact words were what the fuck?! where the fuck are you? when i got her response back i thought i was gonna go crazy because she said i don't know. 

What happened was that she got so drunk she passed out on the couch while the little gathering got out of hand because one of her friend got suicidal and was sent to the ER. She was left alone with just a guy in the house, he was apparently in her room when she was passed out at his house. 

In my mind all i thought about was, how could you be so irresponsible to drink so much and not be able to handle yourself? I had other issues to deal with as well, if i was out of town what would she do without me? I might over think it, but i was worried if i could handle this kind of stuff as i'm trying to focus on something in my life. . . I also played out many scenarios in my head about how our talk was going to go down the next day and nothing came out well. She also has history of kidney issues, i have been trying to change her lifestyle so that she can be more healthy. Drinking is definitely out of the question but she continues to ignore this. 

She ended up asking me to pick her up, she reeks of alcohol as i picked her up. I hate the smell of alcohol from her mouth, I drove her home in total silence and brought her to her bedroom without saying a word other than get out of the car.

I stayed with her for a few minutes then she told me i could leave, so to save us from unnecessary fight at 1:30am i  rushed out and went home.

12465,Relationships,1vo3yn,"I have been with my boyfriend, who I will refer to as Adam, for one year - living together for 4 months.  (We were friends prior for about 4 years.)

Over the past year Adam has done a lot to improve his life.  He's lost weight, gotten healthier, and curbed some of his excessive spending habits.  The problem here is that he's curbed *some* of these habits.  Over the summer he was in a really bad monetary position and couldn't seem to get ahead; all of his bills were late.  I lent him a small sum of money to get him back on track.  Adam only paid a portion of the money back, but I trusted him and wasn't too worried about it.  In fact, I would go on to loan him additional money hoping that he would cease the opportunity to really get ahead.

Cue us moving in together.  I asked for transparency with both of our finances so we didn't end up in a position where bills were late - he agreed.  While we don't share any joint accounts, we are aware of each other's income and budgets.  After reviewing his budget I saw that he had a small deficit and pointed it out to him right away.  Adam reviews the budget, agrees there is a problem, and tells me he'll either pick up more hours at work or by doing odd jobs to make up for it.  (At the time, the deficit was only $100.00 each month.)

I tried to be sensitive to his financial position and took the bulk of the bills, including 60% of the rent.  The first couple of months seemed to be going smoothly - I kick myself now for not paying better attention to the situation.  In early January I became aware that we had past due bills.  Adam had gone ahead and marked our electric bill paid in our shared budget manager for November and December, and I trusted this to be true.  When I hopped onto our account to check our usage, however, I was shocked to see that we had a large outstanding balance.  I confronted Adam on this and all I got in return was, I'll take care of it.

I was extremely upset because I had money set aside for these bills - all Adam had to do was send it in.  Now I found myself scrambling to put this money back together because the initial funds were gone.  (I have savings, but I do not like to touch them outside of emergencies or major life events - so I was scrambling to use my standard paycheck to pay the past due bills.)

This is when I really started to tear our budget apart and take a closer look at our funds.  Despite all of the money I had loaned Adam to get him current on his bills, he still managed to get a full month and a half behind!  (And he was hiding it from me!)  I've asked him repeatedly how he managed to go through so much money so quickly and he doesn't have an answer for me.  We live together - I haven't seen evidence of any major expenditures.  I'm at a complete loss here.

Yes, it is partially about the money.  For me it's also about trust, personal responsibility, and feeling taken advantage of.  I grew up without parents or a financial support system.  I had to work full time my entire way through college, pulling 60-hour weeks to get by.  I am very fortunate to have the life I have today, and would have killed for the opportunities that I have offered Adam.  Maybe it was an overly romantic thought, but I remembered what it was like being in such a difficult position and really thought that I could help him to help himself.

The last several weeks have been very difficult.  I have been very honest and up-front about how I'm feeling.  Adam claims he is remorseful and made a big push to get a second job.  He says he was hired at one and was supposed to start today, but I haven't heard a word about it since.  I expect he'll be home right after he finishes his primary job.  I feel too tired to confront him about it anymore.

Adam speaks about wanting to marry me and pay me back as quickly as possible - that he knows he fucked up and wants to make it up to me.  I wish his actions supported this more.  I have recently accepted a really wonderful job opportunity on the other side of the country.  Adam and I have known that I might get this opportunity for several months and had initially planned to go together.

Aside from being financially irresponsible, Adam is a great guy.  Because of my upbringing I have a hard time sleeping at night and being affectionate - among other things.  Adam has been incredibly supportive and has helped me work through some of my problems.  We have a ton in common and many mutual friends.  I wish more than anything this hadn't happened, because I don't know how I'm supposed to trust him anymore.

Adam is presently debating either moving with me and trying to get employment as soon as his feet hit the ground in our new location, or staying where he is to try to build up funds and meeting me later.  Additionally, some of his family &amp; friends have gotten wind that I've pulled my current financial support from him and will not assist him in paying to move with me.  They're angry.  They think that, since we're part of a team, that I should continue to shovel out money because that's what I'm supposed to do.  I think this is ridiculous and am feeling hurt that I'm being talked about like the bad guy here.  (Adam says he stands up for me and explains my point of view, but that some people don't understand.)

Adam says he will fix it.  Do I believe him?  Even if he does move to fix things, do I let him?  (Is this relationship worth fixing?)

I flew a few states away for work and have been gone for the past week. My flight was delayed because of weather and I told her I would just stay the night. But on impulse, I decided to catch the red eye and then drive back through the morning. I figured it'd be a nice surprise. 


I pulled up and noticed another car in the driveway. It didn't really sink in; I just thought it was odd for how early it was. I come home late pretty often, so I'm good at getting in quietly. Walked in, unpacked my dirty clothes and put them in the hamper, then went to the bedroom. The were both in bed, only partly covered by the sheets. I didn't recognize the other guy immediately. They were both asleep, and I don't know how long I stood there. It didn't compute. 


After I recognized the guy in bed with her, I had one of those moments. Just a red second where I imagined picking up something really heavy and smashing his face. But it passed pretty quickly. I was just really tired and a little sad. I woke her up and told her I was going to a hotel. I think she was too sleep groggy to get it at first, she was smiling for a little bit before remembering. She got up and was starting to talk and cry but I just tuned her out. I grabbed some spare clothes and got out. I turned off my phone before I left the driveway.


I just don't know what to do right now. I feel like I've been in a car accident. Just sitting here in this shitty hotel room drinking some crappy whiskey I got at the supermarket on the way over. I've got my laptop, my phone, a change of work clothes and that's about it. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I don't wanna BE anymore.

**tl;dr**: Cheated on/What do I do



**Update:** Read the email she sent me

Finished reading it.


Cried for a bit because she was pretty blunt about it. It wasn't the first time they'd slept together, and she didn't try and say there were extenuating circumstances or anything. I wasn't drunk or stoned. He didn't coerce me. I was flattered when he hit on me. He's a very attractive man that could probably sleep with lots of women. So for him to choose me was very special. It was a chance to satiate my enormous ego.


She said that she'd understand if I wanted her out of the house and out of my life. She thanked me for not calling her a whore or a slut or etc even though I am. She said that I didn't have to stay in a hotel, that she'd be out of the house in the morning and that she'd leave her keys there. Then she apologized for destroying your trust in me and betraying everything we had.


If I never want to talk to her again, she said that I don't have to. I can't do anything that would account for what I've done. No apology is enough. I was selfish and arrogant and deceitful for no other reason than I wanted to be. As much as I want it, I don't deserve your forgiveness. I can only still ask because I'm a hypocrite. I'm sorry.


Just reading this is making me cry again. I'm glad she didn't try to justify what she did. But I'm still lost.


---

**Update**


I've been back home for a few hours. I made myself a grilled cheese with onions and watched some Cosmos. I almost wish I'd been called in to work, it'd be easier to keep my mind off things. As it is, it's been very hard to resist the urge to call her. I don't know how I'm supposed to settle things either way without contacting her at some point.


In the meantime, I've gotten a few phone messages. A few were from her family, who I'm on very good terms with. I guess at some point yesterday she told them that she'd cheated. Her sister let me know that she'd be staying at her place in a spare bedroom. And her Dad texted me an apology, saying that he thought he'd raised her better. No messages from her, which I was kind of relieved about. If I heard her voice, I'd be tempted to call. I very nearly blew my top when I saw I'd gotten a text from her coworker. *sorry dude I didn't know*. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. I don't really care as long as I never see him again.


I've gotten a lot of advice and support from people, which I really appreciate. A few think I'm some kind of asshole for not immediately throwing her out. I don't agree, but whatever. However, I also received a few really disturbing and virulent messages suggesting I should have taken it much further than that. If I'm a Beta because I didn't send someone to the hospital, then call me a Beta. I'm not out to please people like you, and my heart pumps piss for that kind of misogynistic bullshit.


Anyway from the advice I've gotten, it seems like a protracted separation would be the best way to determine how I feel. I don't regret the last 5 years, even given what's happened. But I need some perspective, and I'm not the type to rush into anything. So I won't be tossing all of her belongings in the trash. What I could use some help with is figuring out the timeframe. How long should I wait? There has to be a discussion at some point.

12468,Relationships,1h5s21,"Hi everyone.

I've been going out with my boyfriend for 2.5 years, and we have numerous tiffs but, as everyone says, arguments are normal; so I'm not too bothered by it. Also note he has depression, but has been taking medicine and also says that I've been making him feel a lot better.

Lately, we've been having a lot of arguments. Recently while going out with friends, I was in a bad mood - not due to anything in particular as far as I can tell, I just felt quite gloomy. My boyfriend told me that I should just cheer up; and also that my bad mood was ruining the mood of others around me. After I replied that I didn't really think I could cheer up, he said that I only didn't think I could cheer up because I was limiting myself and that since he could just 'cheer up' even though he had depression, I should be able to as well!

Now, I'm not really sure whether I'm justified in being upset about this. On one hand, I think perhaps he does have a point - maybe I AM just limiting myself and I could be cheered up if I thought that way - but on the other hand, when I'm upset just 'cheering up' isn't something I can do. But then the more I think about that point, the more unsure I am; of course I would think that I can't just cheer up if I'm limiting how...cheerful I could be.

Moreover I'm also annoyed with this attitude of I can do it, therefore so can you! And after he told me that I was ruining the moods of people around me I felt even worse. 

I don't know if I'm just being overly pessimistic and he is making a valid point. Overall, I'm never really sure whether I'm justified in feeling how I do, or whether my points are valid or not in disagreeing with him here.

12469,Breakups,1umgqq,"So, my girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years as of october, the first 2.5 years were pretty smooth. We moved in together under the conception that we both really cared about each other. I think the real reason in the back of our minds was because we both needed to move out of our previous living situations with others and it was the only way we could afford to not move back home, which neither of us wanted to do. 

For the last year or so I have had mixed feelings about our relationship; whether or not we should be together...are things really going as well as we would like. Do I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl? I have to say, she feels that everything is going well and she wants to get married, I however, do not share the same feelings. Don't get me wrong, I care about her, shes a great girl and we've matured together a lot but I just don't think I can be with her anymore. I have felt like our relationship has been on auto pilot....work, come home, watch some tv, believe it or not I do all the cooking so if we don't want takeout its up to me to do the cooking. Then dishes sit there. The sex is alright but not really anything more than average, a lot of the time I'm bored with it. I've tried to spice things up a bit (toys, different new positions, role play) but that hasn't really helped me get into it much more.

Back in the middle of 2013 I met a girl, we saw each other at random places a few times and one day she gave me her number, I politely accepted and proceeded to text her later that day. I told her I had a girlfriend and she said that was OK, we could just be friends but that she did like me. Over the next month or so we made small talk, got to know each other but didn't hang out. I found out she was going to do a study abroad program in EU and that she'd be gone for 6 months (cool) and we kept talking randomly for short text bursts. I didn't think much of it at the time but I started developing some feelings for this girl. 

As time has gone on and the date of her departure approached, we started talking more and more until she finally got me to come hang out with her. I spent time over at her place (nothing happened) but I realized that I really like this girl. We started to spend more time together and eventually stuff happened with us. I tried to stop but I couldn't help but see her again before she left. We decided that when she gets back we want to be together but obviously I need to break up with my current girlfriend first. 

I don't know what to do at this point. She left for her study abroad just a few days ago, I have been making myself sick, can't eat or sleep, because I can't figure out how to come to grips with what is happening. I turned my life upside down for someone that isn't even here now. I have to break up with my girlfriend and I'm just not sure how to go about it, we live together, she can't afford the place we live in alone.  I know that even if I don't end up getting together with the other girl when she gets back that it still is not fair to my girlfriend to stay together right now too but my brain is such a jumbled mess right now I can't think straight.

I guess I need someone to help me to put things in perspective and to work through the feelings I'm having right now so that I can think clearly.

12471,Relationships,2wgm7z,"My boyfriend and I are in sort of a long distance relationship. He visits me every late Friday for our club meets to Sunday usually while I am in University and he is in community college living at home. Since starting a new term, I've been extremely overwhelmed with classes and I picked up a job that requires me to be in all day Sunday. So now I only really see him on Saturdays, and with my time management schedule, I only have that Saturday to do my homework, have personal time, and see my significant other. This makes me extremely strung out, also considering I have quite a few bad ties to people in my university, meaning, in lay-man's terms, I don't have friends that I can vent to. This usually results in me being very irritable when I do see him, because I have to juggle high level class homework (I'm taking multiple 400 levels) as well as making him happy and doing what he wants to do. Irritability leads to yelling and rarely do I scream, but the yelling usually is brought on by extremely small things that he does. 
Considering I only see him for one day a week and I yell about 1/4 of the time he is over for the day, this is a pretty serious issue.

I also spent the winter with him while I was re-taking a winter Calculus course, consisting of six hours of work per day including a few hours of video lessons per day. Did I mention no day breaks to rest for a while? I was also strung out, because I had failed two years of calculus in high school as well as one term in university, and was hoping to get my GPA back up to reattain my scholarship. His family loves me but also knew that something was off with me as well.
I was diagnosed at my university with Borderline Personality Disorder, if that is of any help. What doesn't help me is that my school counselor is booked and has turned from a helpful counselor into a how does that make you feel counselor. 

ANYWAY, after yelling I usually calm down and ask him if I'm abusing him, to which he replies no. I ask only because I know I have a temper and I know he absolutely hates yelling, but he never tells me it's a problem that I needed to fix. So my boyfriend told me Monday night that I'm abusing him, but he won't go into depth with any of the details or what is specifically bothering him, so the yelling is just a speculation on my part. I really need help with this, and I want to know how to stop. I love this man, and he makes me happier than words can describe, even if he doesn't think he does. He really does.

Be prepared for a complicated story :p. I'll try to only say the most important things ;).

So basically I became very close with this girl (lets call her G for the sake of this post). G is the ex of my best male friend( lets call him M) ( it's over for about 8 months now). We got very close this summer and we started texting daily and seeing each other a few times a week. But I started to get strong feelings for her, at first I ignored them cause she was my M's ex and I know he was still not over her and I also didn't want to ruin our friendship cause even tho she is the ex of my M she became my girl best friend. And I don't know about you guys but for me there is a big difference between those two kind of best friends.

Anyways summer ended, and university started for  all of us. I do engineering so I don't have much spare time. So I do see M less but I take the train with G to uni most of the days. And we also text a lot ( I know that I'm repeating myself sorry :p). My feelings for her only became stronger and I had the feeling that she also felt something for me. We also never said to be each other best friends cause it felt like that description really didn't fit too well for us.

Things changed about a month ago when I went to her place to watch a movie together, we ended up kissing and she told me she also had feelings for her. But you know I wouldn't be posting here if everything went great from then on :p. G has some psychological problems, she doesn't see herself like I do. She has a very low self esteem and is also a cutter. And she told me she can't fully love me as long as she doesn't love herself. I said that I understood it and that I didn't want her to push her into anything she doesn't want. Time passed by and we kissed two more times. But after the last time I asked again what will happen between us. She said she isn't ready for it and as much as she'd love that it all would have been easier she can't start a relationship now.

Yesterday we were texting again and I ended up asking if there would have been more if she hadn't all those things in her mind which she always says to be the reason. She gave a long reply but I'll summarize it; she also has feelings for me but she totally doesn't want a relationship now and she doesn't think she will be ready for it any time soon, she wants to feel better first but she already feels this bad for over a year and the progress is very slow. She also said that it's hard for her that I'm M's best friend and that she doesn't want to lose me by starting a relationship and losing me with a break up because she lost a lot of close friends the past year and losing me is the last thing she ever wants.
But I think I love her too much to only see her as a friend for the rest of my day. But if I'm realistic I know that the chance that we're ever together is very slim. 

And I don't know what to do now, I love her and she loves me but that the only thing it will be and nothing more. I don't want to lose her and I don't want to leave her cause she needs me when things are getting bad for her again. And I know she will always respect our feelings so I don't have to be afraid that she starts dating someone else or something like that.

I don't really know for what kind of advice I'm even looking but it helped writing this down and reading our last night conversations again. So thank you for reading and if you want to say something or ask something, please go ahead.

12474,Relationships,243dl6,"Although it might be a surprise due to our ages, I practically live with my girlfriend. My mother moved to America about 6 months ago and left me here. I moved in with my girlfriend at her house with her family 4 months ago. I pay rent and live in her bedroom.

Before she went on vacation we had a bit of a rough patch where we fought a lot over nothing etc (I attribute this to my unsureness in the relationship, I was questioning the relationship since I am now in university and she is in high school, I'm able to go out clubbing and do whatever I like, I was asking myself questions like was the relationship going to progress? etc.)

We've been dating for 2 years and are sexually active.

She went with a group of 20ish people, during the time she was gone, I became extremely lonely and messaged her a lot throughout the day and only recieved a sprinkle of replies, which I was okay with since I knew she would be doing a lot of touring etc and didn't have the resources all the time to message me either.

I realised while she was gone how much she meant to me and my previous difficulties in the relationship were completely gone, I had made up my mind that I definitely wanted to be with her for the years to come. 

Once she came back I was extremely excited to see her and from my point of view she did not seem equally excited. We did not have sex the night she came back which was a little disappointing, but she was jet lagged and everything so I was okay with it.

She woke up late the next afternoon and was glued to her phone/computer the entire time. During her vacation she had become very good friends with 5 new guys. Constantly messaging all of them and everything and seemed to basically ignore me.

The next night she asked me to leave her house and live at my grandma's for 2 days, since she wanted to see her other friends and have them over and have some time to herself.

That weekend I came back and we finally had sex, she had been home for 5 days. Before she left we had sex at least once per day, skipping a day here and there. An obvious decline in sex.

She falls asleep without me and often wakes up during the night from messages from one of these 5 guys and messages them from 12am-3am.

She's been back for almost 2 weeks and we have only had sex twice, have not gone out for a date or anything of the like. 

She recently asked that I start living with my grandma more since she is in her senior year and high school is getting stressful since she wants to get into medicine. She needs more time to herself to study etc.

I feel like she ignores me and prefers to be and talk with other friends instead of me. Reddit what do I do? I'm so lost. Am I being over controlling and clingy? Am I in the wrong that I feel she talks to other people more than me?

The worst thing is there isn't anything bad about us. She is staying in the house until she finds a new place to live. It is so hard seeing her everyday. I want to tell her I love her and convince her she is making a mistake. I have broken down several times in front of her..pleading her to stay. Hoping that I can spark something inside her.

However, everything I do is just pushing her away. I can't even look at our dog without thinking of her and our hopes and dreams which isn't fair to lexi. How do you just let go of six years?

12477,Relationships,1m9u4j,"Hi everyone! I don’t really know where to begin but I’ll try to provide some background. I desperately need advice.

My boyfriend (19M) and I (18F) have been dating for over a year and a half. He goes to college in Maryland and I go to college in New Jersey.  We frequently get into fights and when we first got together we would occasionally get into fights that would be extremely serious (He would scream at me, call me a bitch, tell me to fuck myself, that he would never talk to me again, that he hated me, he never loved me, I was a waste of his life etc.). I made of point of never cursing at him because I know I hated it. Most of the time I would be the one ending the fight and apologizing. 

We broke up after Prom in 2012 because he wouldn’t let me see my friends and told me I shouldn’t miss anyone if I was with him. He repeatedly called me “a fucking bitch” and told me that he hated me in front of all of his friends. I decided I couldn’t continue the relationship and broke up with him. A few days later we got back together because he was extremely apologetic. He tried to blame it on alcohol and clubbing (we were living in Europe at the time), even though I know it was not the case.

We moved on from that and since then he hasn’t cursed at me much when we fight. There are times when he does act the same way he did at Prom, but he always apologizes. 

I thought that our relationship was doing really well and his behavior was improving until last night.

I was throwing out ideas of when we could see one another again for extended periods of time. I suggested he take a class at Georgetown this summer because I would like to have an internship in DC so we could stay together. He is an international student, so he can’t spend the summer in the USA if it’s not for school. He laughed at me and told me that I was getting ahead of myself (which I know I was, but I was just thinking aloud) and he told me that he thought we would breaking up in the spring. I told him that what he said really hurt my feelings, and he laughed at me and sarcastically said, “sorry for being realistic”. I asked him to apologize and he wouldn’t. He said “I’m not going to be sorry for being realistic. If you want that then you need a different boyfriend”.

I suggest we take a couple-day long break (this is the second time this week he told me to find a new boyfriend) and he told me that I wasn’t working hard enough in the relationship and that it would be my fault if it failed. 

The conversation continued as I told him that he was hurting my feelings and he said that he didn’t care. I went to bed and told him I didn’t want to talk to him for a day”.

This was our most recent conversation:
&gt;**ME**: Please just stop talking to me. I’m done for today
&gt;
&gt;**HIM**: Ok I will. I'll stop talking to you. Don't act like everything is ok. I'm just so pissed. It took a whole 2 days &gt;between me telling you I love you to this. I'm not telling you again Cus it messes everything up. You forget everything so &gt;quickly. That I don't know how this is supposed to work out because at the end of the day who always talks to you when &gt;your having other problems? Who always makes you feel better? Who came to you on Friday cus you had a fight with your &gt;dad? ME. But it doesn't matter to you. All it takes is a bit of uncertainty on my part and you don't want to talk. I'm stupidly &gt;trying to fix this by trying to talk. But nooooo. You're too good for that. So fine. It's your problem. I feel like such an idiot for &gt;doing everything for you.

12478,Relationships,21o14n,"My girlfriend and I are in a relationship for about 7 months now and I must admit, while everything runs pretty well, we are quite different in terms of hobbys and education (she's doing her master after 12 semesters in Uni, I didn't go to Uni at all). She is a sweet and quiet little bird, me and my friends are more on the rock and metal side and tend to be a little louder.

One thing that's been a problem is that she can't completely hide the fact that she's just not that much into my friends. She always seems to bite through interactions with them but doesn't complain. When I'm with my friends, I talk to them about music, concerts, festivals, etc., which are no topics for her. The only things she talks about whith her own friends, who I find pretty boring myself, seem to be their studies, their professors and all the things I don't know anything about. The only overlapping friend in our relationship is my brother.

Yesterday, we went out with my friends again. I already told her, that we wouldn't stay long, I just wanted to meet them, have a couple of beers and she was okay with that.
After two hours she seemed twitchy and eager to go. We said goodbye to my friends and on our way home, she started crying and said I just can't stand your best friend. When I asked what happened she said You're a completely different person around him.

Somehow that struck me hard. Sure, he's my best friend, we goof around a lot, have a lot of inside jokes and I just like hanging around with him. Maybe I tend to say things that I wouldn't say in a conversation with my girlfriend, but it's nothing horrible. He's my best friend for more than 5 years now.

Now I don't know how to go on. I know she won't put me to a choice between him and her because she's not like that. But how can I ever take her out with my friends again without a bad conscience? We are semi long-distanced, so I only see her on weekends. Every weekend we change, so one week I go to her, the other week she comes to me. But I can only see my friends on weekends, too. So now I feel like I really do have to choose between them. I can't force her to like my friends, so I will have to compromise. But it sucks. I love her and I want to be with her for another while, but this is really a tough one. How should I deal with that?

don't think people my age can feel real 
love. But I really think I did. And it just 
ended today:(  (Also I'm on mobile so I'm 
am SO sorry if the formatting is weird!)





I'll give you a little bit of a backstory. My 
boyfriend (now ex) is also 17. He's 2 days 
younger than me. We first got together 
Februrary of Sophomore year when he 
gave me a giant stuffed bear on 
Valentine's Day and told me he'd had a 
crush on me for 2 months. He was my 
first real boyfriend so I was so awkward 
and shy and I didn't want to kiss in the 
hallways. Plus he was semi-popular, on 
the football team, not afraid to talk out 
loud in class. People knew me, I wasn't like invisible, but they knew me as a nice 
quiet girl who was just kinda there. So I 
was extremely self consious when I was with him. 




The first break up was a month before school got out fir the summer and 2
months after we first started dating. I didn't cry. I knew it was a long shot. The last month of school went smoothly. We 
didnt talk but we didnt, like, hate each 
other. School got out for the summer 
and that was that. But then about a 
month into June he texted me. He was 
like Hey I can't take it anymore. I was so 
happy he texted me. Just a few days 
earlier I was crying cause I saw a picture 
of tortured kittens and the cat mom's 
sad little face on reddit and then it just 
turned into crying about my life and 
crying about him. But when he texted me I wasn't sure if I wanted to go back out 
with him because of how self consious he made me. But I kept texting him.





Throughout the summer I told him about how I felt and he told me not to worry about what people thought and stuff like that. But still I wasn't sure so everytime he tried to make plans I turned them down. But we still texted almost every day.





Then Junior year started and I had him for 2 classes. When he saw me after 3 months of not seeing each other, he 
hugged me really tight. He used to be so 
sweet. Anyway during the first week of 
school we decided to get back together 
again. I was still awkward during the first 
few months. But the longer we were 
together, the better we got.





It was so fun being with him. He was my first everything. First boyfriend. First kiss. First friend to come to my house. First boy to meet my dad. First sexualexperience.  It was just so fun. Usually I feel like a little kid but I felt my age with him. And he was so sweet and loving. It was just great. We lasted all Junior Year. (Well we actually got in a fight the last week of school and broke up for the weekend) But yea he was just so special to me.





The thing is, Senior Year is his last year before he goes into the military. He's going in right after this school year. So I told him last summer that I didn't want to hold him back from his first year of freedom. But he said I wasn't. Then weeks later he told me he DID want freedom but he didn't want to lose me cause I was special or some cliche thing like that. So we decided to stay together the rest of the summer and talk again when school started.





School started this Monday. He hadn't been the same for a month now. He hadn't sent me cute text messages or complimented me for almost a month. I felt like he didn't like me anymore. I was gonna break up with him today because I knew he didn't like me anymore. Today I kinda gave him the cold shoulder. I wanted to break up with him after school but I didnt want to act all friendly like nothing was wrong with him today. So I didnt wait for him to walk to class together. I didn't kiss him goodbye or anything. I wanted to, you know, give him the hint about how I felt so he could be prepared for when I did it.




After school I went to our spot. But I 
couldn't do it. I gave him the stuff I was 
holding for him and just looked down at 
the ground. I just couldn't do it. I didnt't 
want to anymore. He hugged me and was like You know I care about you right? And I swear to god I thought he was gonna apologize for not being into the relationship for the past month. I thought he was gonna tell me he was 
gonna do better and that he wanted us 
to last. But no he went on the say I think we should break up I felt so pathetic. All 
I said was Yeah and then he said But I 
still want to be your friend cause you're 
amazing. And I just pushed off him and told him to have a good day at work. And I left. 





And now I just dont know what to do. We were together for a year. I lost my 
virginity to him. I have him for 3 classes. 
He DOESN'T care about me anymore! He 
hasn't for months now. I don't want to be his friend. I want to be done with school and never see him ever again. I feel so pathetic and confused because I 
WANTED to break up with him but now 
that it's happened... I keep feeling we'll get back together because that's what 
happened the last two times but I don't 
want to count on it.





So I just need the advice of some adults 
on reddit who've been through the same 
thing or something similar. Should I try 
to be his friend? Should I change my 
schedule so I see him less? If he wants to get back together should I? What do I do tomorrow when I sit next to him in 3 
classes? What should I do to get over 
him? Please I need advice. Please help me feel better.

I know people say this often when it isn't true, but it really was a fairly mutual decision. Either of us could have had the power to say let's keep going and we would have, but neither of us did.

12484,Relationships,2d97yr,"Got engaged about a year ago, and the wedding is fast approaching. This is a second marriage for both of us, but the first time around we both eloped at 19 at the courthouse without anyone else there.
  



So this time around I wanted to do it right, and was excited for the opportunity. However, neither of us are traditional people, think spending 20k on a wedding is batshit insane, and we are both atheists. So while I wanted to celebrate our life together surrounded by friends and family, I didn't want to do something huge and traditional either. But she's incredibly introverted and very concerned about money, and even the idea of our current plan has her so stressed she isn't remotely excited about it, is dreading it entirely, and it's starting to make me wish we weren't doing anything, and I'm bummed I'm not as excited as I used to be.
 


So the plan (which seemed reasonable at the time) is we are renting a house on the ocean, and sort of having a weekend long beach party. About 30-40 people tops. Maybe less. Short, non-traditional ceremony I'm writing myself. I have only invited my immediate family, but she has some extended family coming who live in the area. Other than that it's by and large mutual friends, though I have one friend she hasn't met flying in. 



I wanted to invite friends/family because I've moved across the country and it seemed like a good opportunity for folks to come visit my new home. I've already greatly reduced the number of people I initially wanted to invite to for her benefit, and have tried to compromise as much as I can. 



She's also concerned about the budget, which is 4k and something entirely within our means considering our income. It isn't putting any real financial stress on us whatsoever. But she grew up very poor, so spending any money on this is making her want to barf. I'm trying my best to be budget conscious for her benefit, despite the fact we realistically could afford to spend more, but having a party and feeding 40 people is gonna cost a certain amount regardless of what I do. 



She says things like: everyone is going to judge me, I'm going to look bad, I'm not attractive, can't find a dress I like, can't show emotion in front of people, people are going to think it's stupid, they'll be let down because it won't live up to their expectations, etc. (BTW, she's like as hot as a model, and will look gorgeous no matter what).



At this point, she's so afraid to stand up in front of everyone, that I am OK with her not even saying anything or writing her own vows (which is something that I was initially excited about -- her saying how she feels about me). I've also suggested exchanging them in private. We aren't doing the ring thing either. We literally are just gonna stand up for ten minutes on the beach while our charismatic friend says awesome shit about science and us, and say OK and kiss. There's not even gonna be seating. 



So I'm trying my best to be reassuring, but nothing I say helps, and it's getting to a point where I feel so bad about putting her through this that the feelings of joy I once had about it have been replaced with sadness. How can I be excited about something I know she will absolutely hate no matter what I do? I'd just cancel it if we hadn't already paid for the house, and my friend/family already paid for plane tickets. 



The wedding seems to me about as toned-down and light as it can get. I don't know what else I can do. I already told her I'd take care of everything besides picking out her dress. I can't un-invite people at this point to get it smaller, I can't make the ceremony any less mushy as I already hardly say anything most would consider romantic, I can't make it cost less without not providing food (which would be insane because all my friends are poor, and we are the only ones with money).

He's from New Zealand and lives in London; I'm from Southern California. We met during the summer a little over a year ago. What started as a summer fling turned into a full fledged relationship over the course of a few months. We alternated flying to see each other every month - we've kept this up for 15 months. We were so madly in love with each other. The kind of love where the whole world disappears and you can only see each other. After about a year, we were still giddy at the thought of each other. But our love had matured to the point where we began to see the world again.

In 3 years' time, he would be finished with his masters degree, and in 4 years, I would be finished with dental school. If our relationship were to survive, one of us would have to sacrifice roots and family and move to be with the other person. 

It would be a huge risk, a terrible decision to have to make, and we are still so young. At first we decided that he would move to California. But we soon realized that this isn't something we can decide now because we won't know where things will be in 3 years' time. We tried to carry on with us and postpone the decision-making. 

However, the weight of this impending decision began to eat at our relationship. It was like a poison. The idea of having his life decided for him at 19 suffocated him. Deciding wasn't possible, and living a relationship in limbo was torturous. 

We broke up because it is the best thing for both of us right now. I believe that. It still hurts so much though. I flew to London to see him and we ended things in bed, in each other's arms, last night. He took me to the airport and watched me leave, saying he would miss me so much. Our last words to each other were, I love you.

We still love each other. I cried on a flight attendant's shoulder on the flight back to California because being alone with just my thoughts for hours had made me so sad. She told me her Scottish grandmother's old saying, what's for you won't pass you by. I really hope we'll find our way back to each other one day. 

I realize the only way we'll be able to live now is to move on and get over each other. But at the same time, what we had was amazing. We suited each other so well - everyone said so, and more importantly, we think so. I still have hope that maybe in 3 or 5 years, I'll be in a position to move to London or even New Zealand. We could start again. We would have both grown by then, but we would still be us. 

I just can't deal with the thought that this is the end. It can't be this permanent. How can it be the end if we still love each other? I want to spend my life with this man. But we didn't have a real chance this time: we were too young and life is too complicated and the future is too unpredictable. I want us to have a fair chance at it when we have the power to make big decisions. It can't happen now because we both have a few years before we can really be in control of our own lives. He doesn't know if he wants to live in London or New Zealand. I don't know if I can be in the position to leave California when the time comes. There's a lot that only time can tell. 

I told him that even though we'll both move on, he shouldn't rule me out completely. We still have a chance. Maybe not now, maybe someday. He says he won't rule it out, but we don't know if life will give us another chance. Maybe if the stars align. 

I feel like I'm breaking into pieces, it hurts so much, I miss him so much. I love him. I can't believe this is happening. Where do I go from here? 

TL;DR - boyfriend and I realized that our long distance relationship needs an end date, but we aren't ready to decide it yet. Our relationship was wonderful, but then it grew heavy in limbo. We still love each other so much, but the best thing for both of us right now is to move on. I will move on, but I still don't want to give up on us. I guess I'm just looking for advice, input, support, anything that might make me feel less broken.

EDIT: In case he finds my post and reads this: 
I talked to my aunt. Really talked. She thinks it would be possible to be together and discover the veiled future together. We don't know much about what will happen in 3 or 5 years. I don't know where I'll be for school, you could be working or doing a PhD anywhere in the world. We don't know how our feelings toward each other will be either - whether they'll grow or fizzle out. She thinks we could just be together and see where things go and when the time comes, one of us will take on that responsibility. If you don't step up to it, I would. Or maybe you won't have to step anywhere at all because I'll want to do it. 

The man my aunt married lived in a different state. They saw each other every other month, and she thought for almost the entirety of their relationship that if they stayed together, she would do the moving. Then he decided he wanted to do it, and that's what happened.

I don't mind the missing and only seeing each other once a month. What makes this feel like a relationship for me is the warmth of waking up in the morning and being so grateful to have you in my life, and the comfort of knowing that we're there for each other. I thought breaking up was the best decision yesterday, but now I'm not so sure. Maybe I miss you too much. Or maybe I've come to be okay with being in a relationship and not knowing where we're going, as long as we are happy and growing together. We could greet the future as it comes. Together.

Lately I've been feeling unhappy - he's got a new job where he's gone a lot now so that's not so bad to get used to, except it took a lot of begging for him to spend time with me and ONLY me his last days off.. he found out last night he has two more days off, today and tomorrow, so I suggested quite a few things we could do - quadding, go see some waterfalls, go to the river, the lake, go mudding, etc, &amp; he refuses all of them! He wants to spend another weekend on the couch and I'm getting sick of that. My one friend works weekends and other than that, there's nobody else that would do those things with me. I want to explore and be adventurous but working monday to friday 8-5, the weekend is my only time to do that and nobody can go with.

I also got a hint from his mother that he and his father are similar that way,  &amp; his dad gets very irritable and angry when he gets dragged into something everyone else wants to do but he doesn't, so it looks like this is somethin I'll have to look forward to the rest of my life if I stay with him.

I was friends with this woman before we started dating. I'm also somewhat friends withs several exes, including one who is still very close to me - so I get how staying friendly and affectionate (in a way) can be very valuable.

She (25/F) was dating this sorta sugar-daddy dude  (45/M) when our relationship became romantic. He seems like a good enough dude, just not one who really captured her heart. I recognize that breaking things off is awkward, especially when nothing is wrong, and I never really pressed her on it, figuring that she would break it off in her own way. We did however have a talk where we pledged to be exclusive/monogamous. 

We spent lots of time together (3 nights a week?), expressed so much love, were super touchy (we both went to massage school together), and really opened up about some harder stuff. We both pedestal-ed the other, had those silly where does someone like you come from?, and just really connected - we never even fought.
(I'm smiling as I think about this. Whatever ends up happening, I connected with this person for a bit. . .)

About a month ago, I notice that she's become distant, and we talk about it a few days later. She tells me that she never really broke it off with the sugar daddy dude. I never pressed for details. I kinda wish I had now - I don't know how often they hooked up, what their relationship consisted of, or what she really feels about him. She seemed so ashamed. I pressed her on why it happened, and she talked about being scared of how well we were working and how that could lead to such deep commitment - and she was scared that I wouldn't feel that way.

I went into damage control mode and (IMO is hard to do well right here) was super understanding and loving. I wanted to fix things, and I don't see much point in assigning blame. I could see her trying to support me in her words and action as well.

Since then, things have mostly been good on the surface. But I'm having trouble trusting her. I see the sugar daddy dude around, and am sometimes even close to him in her yoga class (she teaches). I feel terrible when I see him (and I bet he feels bad too - he didn't know about me)

She's having trouble connecting to me too. She has felt me sorta withdraw, and has especially noticed that in our sexual connection (where I was never confident). The other day, she sat me down and talked about how she's felt that for awhile - and that felt like a bombshell. I now wonder what other thoughts are hiding below the surface.

To top it off, I'm almost positive she went to a concert the other night with the sugar daddy dude (it was on facebook). I'm not the person to say no to this sort of thing, but it really challenged me. She never attempted to explain this to me, which really really would have helped. It's easy to feel like she's (at least) emotionally cheating on me again.

I expressed lots of these needs (to have her really open up and tell me what happened, to feel like I can trust her, as well as my insecurities in areas like my sexual prowess or my innate worth) in a recent long email, and she's writing a response. 

But the wait is agonizing. 
I don't know what to do, or how to care for myself in all this. 
Our connection has been AMAZING, as we've both seen how loving and supportive it can be.

How does one begin to trust again? How does one know where to do draw a line? How does one communicate assertively but also with love and understanding?
It's very very hard to do my internal work (with esteem and trust and caring for myself like I care for her) with all this.

12492,Relationships,2rn3q7,"First, i'll give some back story to our relationship to help bring everyone up to speed. My girlfriend and I have known each other for 8+ years and have been best friends ever since we met in high school. We have always had feelings for each other but the timing was never right for us. We've dated different people but we both came to the realization about how strong our feelings really were for each other down the road. So, I made the decision that I didn't want to be with anyone else and waited 2 years for the time to be right, and now we're dating! I'm truly lucky to be in love with my best friend.

I'm a recent college graduate and began putting my new degree to work at a start up business. This job is everything I've ever wanted in a job. I get to unleash my entrepreneurial side and since i'm young, have a lot less to lose if this business fails. I see a lot of potential with this business to be a multi-million dollar a year company and getting in at the beginning is huge, but it's not about the money for me. It's about developing myself in my job field. Even if this business fails, i'll have learned and developed a long list of skills that can launch me into jobs that I never thought were possible for me. 

My boss is easy to work with and I see him more of a mentor now, not just a boss. He's helping me along the way with exposing me to as much of the business world as he can. We work well together and bounce ideas off each other, we are great at what we do and I trust he isn't playing me for a fool by trying to launch his business only to reward me very little. Since it's a startup business cash flow is tight, which leaves me with very little pay. I was aware of this from the beginning and I will be rewarded for my efforts if the business succeeds or fails. 

As the title states, my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now and we are approaching the point in our relationship where we decide how to take the next step in our relationship. We both see a future with one another and at this point we are looking to get a little more serious about our relationship but have hit a wall trying to figure out how to do that.

When my girlfriend and I first started dating I was very upfront about my goals for my future. I'm a very hard worker and I planned to pay off my student loans as fast as I can while living at home with my parents before I even considered moving out on my own. Essentially, I want to pay off my student loans in full in two years, this timeline is very feasible I must add. Personally, I think it's the smartest thing to do so that I'm not paying off interest for 10+ years and carrying that debt with me while i'm trying to settle down with her and start a family.

Recently, she's run into some financial troubles and has had to move back in with her parents (who live 1.5 hours away) to find a new job and save money to afford a place of her own again. She's struggling to find a steady job but she has set a goal to afford to move out by mid-2015. She also wants me to move out with her. It's hard to develop our relationship further while we are both living with our parents and she's the one that drives up to see me, she was very clear that she does not want me to visit her because of a rough situation she has with her family (who i've met before and can see why she was clear on this).

Since we have both spoken about a future together she's suggesting we start our future sooner rather than later. I'm at a point now where in order to afford to move out, which i'm still not 100% comfortable with because I haven't even started paying off my student loans, then i'll need to find a new job with a steady paycheck. Me not choosing right away to move into a place together has scared her and now she's afraid that i'm wanting to put more focus on my job rather than our relationship. But leaving this job and giving it all up doesn't sound appealing to me, though on the other hand she's the one I want to be with and I don't want to lose her over a job.

So now I feel stuck, should I choose to stay with this job and develop myself and my skills in the job field that I love? In the mean time try to work things out with her and show her that i'm still focused on the relationship. Or do I give it up to move in with her so we can start getting more serious about our relationship?

I deployed to Afghanistan in October 2014 to April 2015. My girlfriend (soon-to-be financé) and I combined our cellphone plan and insurance when I left. She also took watch of my dog. Well, mid way through my deployment, she decided she didn't love me anymore. 


I tried to reignite things to no avail. So I was convinced (manipulated) to give my dog up to her because it wouldn't be fair to the dog. Heartbroken over losing my dog and my partner, I gave up without much fight. 


I severed our ties with the insurance and cellphone plan, but I experienced a hiccup. She added the Edge plan for Verizon (without me knowing). Verizon won't let me kick her off the plan unless I pay the fee ($412 termination). She refuses to pay this fee and because its in my name, I'm stuck with the bill. I'm tired of being handcuffed to this plan that I rarely use. She consistently uses the data up and it's a constant stab to a still pretty fresh wound.


I'm not looking for my dog back. Or my time back. Those are lost causes. Due to some unfortunate financial circumstances, I can't pay that fee and I'm stuck paying the overages every single month. And am constantly reminded of her because of it. I just want to terminate the plan and sever the ties with her, but she won't pay the fee.

We've been together for two months, and although this is a very short amount of time, we've been very close friends for two years now where it has been kind of 'unnofficial', over the course of the two month relationship we have grown even closer despite already being very close friends. 

A little into her personality as It has helped me deduce what was going on with her: She is an extremely caring and attached person, I can say the same for myself. She would write essays practically for birthday letter and spend an ungodly amount of effort into preparing birthday presents. She loves conversation and I would put her and myself under the title of 'overly attached'. We are both high achieving students, with her being the head student in our school - which of course contributes to a lot of her stress. I should also mention that she is very prone and vulnerable to stress, things that I usually wouldn't consider a problem she takes very seriously. But I have accepted that and have helped her as much as I can with her problems, this was also what brought us closer together.

Last week of school (2 weeks ago) the amount we talked decreased by at least 90%, after talking with her I found out that it had resulted from a fight with her best friend along with scholarship and school stress. So I decided to give her some space to sort things out as holidays was soon approaching. 

A week into the holidays and its still the same. I'm getting worried, so I ask about how she's feeling and she tells me she feels very relaxed with not much to do. At this time I am extremely confused, then how come she has still been ignoring me? I talk with her best friend and it seems like she had received the same treatment from my girlfriend. Last week was my birthday, and she didn't even say it to me in real life. I understand this seems very childish - that I feel like the relationship is coming to an end because she didn't say happy birthday, but that's not the problem. The problem is that it is SO unlike her usual behavior. She would put more effort before we were officially together, so I don't understand what happened here. 

At this point I start having doubts about her interest in us, but after leaving a group practice on my birthday, she sends me a text (she hasn't sent me one in a very long time) asking me if I'm still walking home, as it would be ridiculous to be walking in such rainy weather. The language she used was very foreign, it almost feels as if somewhere deep inside her shes still clinging to our relationship, however she's slowly losing her grip - I apologize it's very hard to explain.

Last night I had a talk with her about how she feels about us, and she said that she doesn't have interest in anything anymore, that she felt like maybe she misunderstood friends from romantic partners and that she only considers me as a friend. She also mentions that school stress might have brought this on her, and she can't tell if she feels about me this way temporarily or not. 

It just doesn't add up to me, I know she genuinely loved me, shes a very thoughtful and caring person. So I did some searching up and found out about anhedonia. I don't know what to do at this point. 

After analyzing everything that has happened so far, I think she still does love me, but there's something blocking the way. It feels that as soon as that something is moved, all will be well. I am sure I am not saying this because I desperately want her to be with me again. At the moment I'm taking more of a logical and analytical approach to the matter rather than a impulsive-love-feelings approach. 

Something I forgot to mention above is that her best friend once told me a long time ago that she would sometimes ignore my girlfriend for a period of time, this has happened more than once.That situation seems very similar to the one I'm having now. 

I understand that usually you give things like this time to heal, however I am worried after reading so many articles about anhedonia that this would become a permanent thing if there is no input from myself.

This is made worse by the fact that my husband has no experience with large snakes and the larger the python grows, the more it shows, and also by us having a cat. The other snakes we've had (our corn snake, and my husband's old garter snake) posed no threat but now I constantly worry that the python is going to get out and eat her. I've taken to locking the cat in our bedroom at night, which interferes with our sleep since she meows and scratches at the door, and I constantly worry about her when she's home alone. 

-I'll reiterate, this thing is fucking huge. He is already 6 feet long. 

-I'm home more than my husband so I have to feed it and change its substrates often. I hate doing both. So much. Especially now that he's graduated to eating rabbits and pigs. I honestly think that since my husband bought him without consulting me that caring for it should be his sole job, but I'm not going to let it go hungry or live in its own waste out of pride. 

-I honestly don't think we'll be able to give this snake the best quality of life, which I think is essential for all pets. He's getting too big for the tank he's in, which is his third since we've gotten him, and I don't think we have the room in our house for the enclosure my husband wants to build him. His food is very expensive and eating into our savings, but it's what he needs, so we can't downgrade. The python does not deserve to live in a tiny space and eat inadequate food because my husband wanted one as a kid. At the same time it's a good possibility it could eat us out of house and home. 

-I don't want kids while we own a python and these things can live up to *20 years*. I don't want to never have children, which I've dreamed of, because of a python. 

Because of all these reasons, but especially the ones about our cat and its quality of life, I think we should rehome the python, preferably to a wildlife sanctuary or something. I've gently brought all of this up to my husband-how much mental anguish it causes me, how worried I am for our cat, how the snake is unsustainable-and all he's done is tell me to get over it, accuse me of not caring about his happiness, and tell me I'm being prejudiced against animals that aren't cute and cuddly. None of this is true, not even the last accusation, I liked his smaller snakes a lot. 

How can I communicate productively with my husband about this issue? He already loves this snake and I think that's getting in the way of him seeing reason. 

**Edit: Fucked up the title. My husband is male.** 

**Edit 2: For the snake people-I acknowledge now that our husbandry is probably wrong (proving my point even more!) Also I have been informed that the snake probably wasn't a baby if it's at this size now so take that into an account. I am not the most knowledgeable about snakes.** 
   
**tl;dr**: My husband adopted a Burmese python without consulting me. For a variety of reasons, most of all that I worry that it could kill us and the cat, that we don't have enough experience with large reptiles, and that its conditions are too expensive, I think we should rehome it. My husband thinks this means I hate snakes and is offended I want to rehome the python. I need advice on how to communicate with him in a way that will make him see my perspective.

I live with my girlfriend of 10 years. I want out. The relationship has gone bad for various reasons (no intimacy, total lack of respect). I tried a few times in the last year to get out but she always bought me back in with extremely temporary make-up sex or convincing me she could do better and to give it another go. As our home is jointly mortgaged, I gave in.

This time, I'm done. We had sex last time in January and I jsut didn't feel right about it. I felt like I was forcing myself and it just will never be the same. After reading deadbedrooms, I just smack myself for staying this long.

But tonight, I mean it. I have a suitcase behind me with some clothes, enough for the weekend, and my folks are expecting me later on. I have no idea if she's expecting it, but she's detected I'm very distant from her recently (I wonder why).

12504,Relationships,32xvzx,"Hi all, this is a really silly issue compared to the others.

My ex &amp; I had a great relationship for around 3 years, but we broke up because we realized that we wouldn't be living in the same country anytime in the coming many years.

We still stayed close, because there was nothing wrong with our relationship. We still cared about each other, etc.

That being said, we have happily dated others. And we have been open with our partners about the fact that we stay in touch. No one has had an issue because our catching up is always a quick call or chat to make sure the other is doing fine, nothing questionable.

I met my current girlfriend about 1 year ago. I love this woman, she is the kindest, sweetest person I've ever met. I have told her that I occasionally am in touch with my ex. She has absolutely no problem with that.

My ex and her business partner are going to be in town for 2 days early next week. I am planning to grab a drink with them to catch up. I obviously told my GF about this - she said thanks for letting her know, and that it was not at all a big deal for her, have fun. I told her she's welcome to join, but she is busy with work.

So what's the problem? I feel weirdly like I'm somehow cheating on both these women. Obviously that's not the case. I am super open emotionally with my girlfriend, WAY more than I am with my ex. I have a great sex life with my girlfriend. I love her a LOT.

Yet I feel like somehow I'm being an asshole. I don't know why. I have kept everything 100% above board.

With my ex, given that our relationship was really great and really special to me ... and this is the first time I am with someone else for whom I have that same level of intense feelings ... I feel like I'm somehow cheating on her. It's completely ridiculous!! We both have dated others, I've had literally no problems or feelings of jealousy about her dating other people.

What the fuck is going on in my head? How can I stop feeling like a douche bag? I really don't know what's wrong.

I can't talk to friends about this because I feel like they will just laugh at me. They know how crazy I am about my current GF. they also know that my ex &amp; I stay in touch, but in a hey, you're a good person, I hope you're doing well kind of a way. nothing past that.

We spent almost every day together, talked about everything, were passionate with one another, we were inseparable. Let's call her Lisa (not real name). I work full time while saving up to finish college (part-time); she goes to college full time &amp; works over the summer.



We moved into an apartment together over this past year. I worked late nights, she went to school mid-day. We were limited to our time together &amp; our time together suffered. Over time Lisa began to shut me out; talked less openly. Any conversation I tried to start was answered with vague small talk. I tried to work on our communication issues, but to no avail. 



Our passion began to dwindle to near non-existence. She would often demand massages or time to cuddle but refused to be intimate. I became upset over constantly being rejected; we talked about it, but nothing ever changed. Tired of the psychological torture, debating whether it is me, something I did or said, I stopped trying. 



It is a week before Christmas. My friend, Rich(not real name), was having relationship issues at the time as well, while I confided in her, she revealed that she planned to move states away, over the summer, after graduation. I was devastated. Over the next few months I tried to improve myself &amp; our communication in hopes that she will rethink her plans.



Instead, she spent more time with friends on campus, leaving me home alone. Over the next 5 months, she would come home drunk, sometimes not at all, while trying to sneak in at 7/8am. She would say she was hanging out with [insert random girl name] &amp; try to convince me, that I know her. In April, she went to a convention with my friend's wife, Sarah (not real name).



Fast forward... Last week we moved out of the apartment and went our separate ways. We were still friendly with one another. Last night, I found out she has been seeing another man, Mark (not real name). Curious, I found him on facebook &amp; found him with pictures of my now ex over the course of months. He would refer to her as my girl; I even found they had met up while at the convention in April.



I didn't know whether to believe it, I told my best friend, Rich, and mentioned Mark. He tells me, that not only does Mark work with us, that our friend &amp; coworker John has known about their relationship the entire time.



I'm lost, I don't know what to do. I was optimistic that we could one day reunite. I still love her, but her lies &amp; deceit are killing me. After 24hrs of cooling off, I tried to confront her, to hear her explain when &amp; why. No response. I haven't had contact since.

This have been borrowed deep inside me and haven't even had balls to talk about it anonymously on the internet even but my gf and I are on good terms and we have talkd about it, she's over it many years ago and haven't given me any doubt that I can't trust her and I love her. Also been talking to a therapist once, but wasn't too much help. I desperatly need help because I'm still feeling shitty about it and I think about it OFTEN almost TOO MUCH, driving me INSANE.

I guess there need some background story for this to be relevant. We started the day driving to meet him somewhere in town, we grabbed a meal together and talked about normal stuff like friends do. We where going to this cottage/hut whatever, were we are supposed to meet 3 other friends and hang out drinking.

Well we arrived at the cottage and started to get ready for the drinking, the friends sent us a message they couldnt come anyways for some reason I can't remember. So we said fuck it let's not put all this alcohol to waste. As teenagers we got pretty drunk and me and my girlfriend got pretty heated up at eachother, my friend is drunk and probably horny as fuck from seeing us he wanted to be part of it too. He asked if he could join in some fun, I said no at first but gf was fuck it lets try it and I believe I said no several times but got talked into it to the end, fucking idiot friends right, well I guess I understand why, young and wanting to try out new stuff and shit. I think alcohol got the best of me and I said fuck it aswell. We went into bed and me and gf started kissing and fucking, so basicly he just fingers her while I took a breath and kissed her breasts while we had sex. So that's what he did in this part.

The day after and the weeks to come I talked about my gf about this and gave her another shot to see if we make this work again. Me and my ex bestfriend haven't talked for years, I just said we're done and left it, because he did'nt put in any blame whatsoever or effort to make it good, maybe because I was too mad to give him the chance, either way it's long gone. I don't know but maybe he is a stronger mental person than me and have moved on or maybe he is still butt hurt, I wan't him to suffer as much as me so I won't ever contact him again, but now I don't know if I can keep this up anymore and I have to talk with him to get it out of my system probably. I don't know if he even want to talk to me again, I don't know if I wan't to talk to him still and I don't know if I will come worse out of it. I have alot of anger and I'm not sure talking about what happened many years ago will make this better, maybe I'm butthurt for life. Still can't forgive him and he have made no effort of fixing this, but I think I must fixx it to feel better myself or whatever I must do.

It feels like every time we argue about something our conversation gets derailed and we never end up talking about whatever it was that caused the argument in the first place.

For example, I'll bring something up that's bothering me and over the course of a couple of minutes we'll get to a point where inevitably my husband will try telling me that I said or did something in that conversation that I know for a fact didn't happen. I feel that he twists my words to turn me into the bad guy and instead of actually talking about the issue at hand I end up feeling like I need to defend myself against things that I never said in the first place.

Sometimes, he'll do something that upsets me (like turning music up so loud he can't hear me while I am mid-sentence talking to him) and when I bring it up later he'll try to tell me it never happened at all.

I try really hard to come to a resolution so the argument doesn't come up again, but usually my husband will end it by saying something like, well why don't you divorce me if I'm so horrible...
 
If we use the music incident as an example, he first said, You were not mid sentence when I turned the music up, you weren't even talking, and when I insisted that yes I was in fact talking and I'm sure he knew that because we were in the middle of a discussion about something, it didn't even occur to him that he might not have heard me. Instantly I was a liar who was trying to get him to apologize for something that didn't happen (it definitely happened). Something that could have been a simple five second conversation where he apologized for not hearing me and turning the music up while I was trying to speak, turned into an hour long argument where my husband told me I should just divorce him if he's so horrible and I was eventually so emotionally exhausted that I stopped talking entirely and left the room.

The biggest problem is, when we have these discussions, they are never resolved. We just stop talking for some time and then act normal like it never happened and it inevitably comes up again.

She's fun to be around, easy to talk to, and we just seem to have a lot of chemistry. From the start, I had a few qualms about her lifestyle. For example, she smokes weed and I do not. She's not in school at the moment, and isn't sure what she wants to do with her life. These things were turn offs, but not dealbreakers. Her good qualities seemed to outweigh the bad.

However, today some mutual acquaintances mentioned how she had cheated on several past boyfriends because she didn't know how to break up with them. Another person gave an eyewitness account of how she engaged in some unsavory bedroom activity with one of his friends.

This took me aback, as we had discussed these things before and she shared my loathing of infidelity and one night stands. I had told her that because my past sexual flings ended badly I do not have sex unless I'm in a committed relationship, and she agreed. Like I said, we have a lot of chemistry, so we have engaged in everything outside of sex (making out, groping, dry humping) but I am resolute in delaying the real thing until we are ready to make things official.

I realize these comments are coming from potentially unreliable sources. People gossip, and even though I disagree with some aspects of her lifestyle, she seems to be a good person. Though she did say to me once that she doesn't last long in relationships because she gets bored.

Anyway, if true, they are are major red flags for me and I am leaning towards cutting things off before I get too invested. What do you think I should do?

I've been dating this girl for about six months, we've been official for about four. During this initial dating period, I found out she was still flirting/talking to past lovers and whatnot. She's had quite a few casual sex/FWB situations. We went through a few arguments because, at the same time, she expressed she wanted to be serious with me but she was still flirting with others. Fine. We weren't official, but I remembered to keep my eye out for her. 

This one particular friend, J, usually pops in and out of her life whenever he feels like it. They've been friends for a few years, and occasionally engage in FWB whenever. She still talked and hung out with him a few times while we dated and he always called during odd hours for favors or business ideas. I stated my concern about his intentions and she said if we were to be official it wouldn't be a problem anymore.

One instance had her lying about him calling her at 2-3am during the same time we had a pretty big fight. He had another business idea he wanted to discuss and wanted to meet with her the next day. She almost broke it off with me because of our fight, and I found out the next day that she was talking to him at the same time. I figure they're related - and to top it off, she lied about him calling her the previous night. Said they hadn't talked in a while.

She cried, apologized, etc., told me it was all on the level, it wasn't a flirt, she didn't end up meeting up with him, etc., and then proceeded to block his number after I ended it. 

Now, mind you, she has told me about their FWB off/on history, she has TOLD him that we were dating, and he still expressed interest in fucking around with her again. He, like most men, doesn't care about her seeing someone as long as he can get his. It's disrespectful. 

I didn't want her talking to him again - she agreed.


FAST FORWARD FOUR MONTHS-

We've been official since then. He called a few weeks ago - she was too busy. He called once more last week (twice), and then she called him back. She told me this same day that they spoke (but she omitted that she called him back, simply saying that she answered). 

I ask to see her phone and she admits that she deleted the call log because she didn't want his number on her phone. So -

She said they only talked for five minutes.
She only picked up because he called twice, she wanted to see if he needed something.
He wanted to hang out/take her out, but she declined.
She said she deleted it because she didn't want his number on her phone.

But after digging deeper, I found out that -

The convo was not five, but eleven minutes (small detail, I know)
She deleted the log because she wasn't going to confess at first.
I already mentioned I wouldn't like her talking to him, she did anyway.
He never NEEDS anything when he calls, just wants to take her out.
She wouldn't want his number, but admitted if he called multiple times later on she might answer if he NEEDS something.

So I broke up with her. Fed up. This is not the first time she has done something I didn't like. Once, she hung out with some random guys at a bar, let them buy her drinks and take her and a friend to another bar. She got drunk around them too. 

My question is... is it that big of a deal? She claims it wasn't flirtacious and she knows she fucked up and is even telling him they can't speak anymore. But is it too late? She has a history of this.


TL;DR: Girlfriend has a history of committing light treason concerning other guys. This same guy (previous FWB) has caused her to lie to me on more than one occasion. She still kept in contact with him even after I asked her not to, because he's disrespectful to our relationship. I broke up with her and she's begging me to come back and (supposedly) has already told him they can't be friends again. 

Am I overreacting? Can this still work?

12518,Relationships,1g9wqv,"I've been dating my now fiance for about 5 and a half years, and we've been engaged for about a year and a few months (wedding date is set for end of September).  In preparation, we've been trying to communicate about everything (not that we haven't before, just in a more directed manner I guess).  In light of these discussions, one issue that has come up that we are really struggling with.

I've always know that she has a draw to move to be closer to hometown in WI (where her immediate family consisting of brother and sister, both with small children, and her mother live, along with numerous aunts and uncles and cousins of varying ages).  We currently live about 4 to 4:15hrs away from her home (in MN) and get to see her family fairly regularly, read: probably averages to a little over once a month, mainly consisting of us travelling back there.  Recently, the frequency has maybe been less so with being busy with wedding planning and other things).  My family is spread out all over the country, so there really isn't a central spot that I am drawn to in regards to family.  It was like this growing up for me, too, so I've always had a home is where you are mentality, and have been excited about making MN our home.

In discussing this issue in the past, she has seemed to have varying feelings towards staying where we are (moved here for grad school and have both found good jobs).  For example, she has said in the past that she misses home and whatnot, but has also said that she thought maybe part of the issue has been just not feeling settled here (which I guess I took to mean, getting married, buying a house, starting our own family).  However, it is more beginning to seem like she won't be truly happy unless she lives ~30mn. of her family.  The problem is, the type of work I do really needs the resources of a large city to sustain itself.  The area of WI we are talking about does not really have the resources necessary to support the type of work I do.  There may be some opportunities that crop up, but it is far from a sure thing.  Additionally, the opportunities will almost suredly be worse than my current options, and I would be starting over trying to build a new network of contacts, whereas I have already been able to do that quite well here in MN.

From my own perspective, I would be willing to move, but would be really nervous about moving under certain circumstances (I couldn't find a job/the job I could find would be too much less in relation to my current job/opportunities).  With her job/degree, she could pretty easily find something in the area she wants.  However, at the same time, being recently done with school and in a good job, looking at houses, and potential upcoming marriage, I am really excited about MN and sticking around, especially with many friends from school still in this area (and not really knowing any people from her hometown but her family members).

So, I guess I'm beginning to become afraid that she will never be truly happy here in MN, while this is pretty much exactly what I've been looking for.  Additionally, as I said I would be willing to move under the right circumstances, I'm concerned that those circumstances will never happen, or that my conditions would be vastly different from her conditions for feeling 'OK' to move (to lesser job opportunities/stability in my mind).  So, it would kind of feel like if we continue on this path, I would always be leading her on with the possibility of moving and that something would happen down the road where she just 'needs' to get back home and me just not feeling comfortable with the transition because of jobs/stability, etc.

Any suggestions for how to handle this situation? (currently trying to set up meetings with a marriage counselor, but I thought I would try to get some people's opinions).  I'm sure there is information about our relationship I left out that might be pertinent, so I will try to be responsive to questions (such as her dad passed away 2.5 years ago at 56, which has taken a bit of a toll on her - not sure if she is feeling guilty for not being at home while he was sick...she was in college, and went back pretty much every weekend).

Edit: **Thanks everyone, I've gained some good perspective through all of your comments.  We definitely have a bit more to talk about, but I'm beginning to feel a bit better - reading through my post/comments, I think I may have been playing up her necessity to move closer to home.  I don't mean to imply it's a do or die proposition for her, it's just that its tough for her being away from the rest of her family, feeling like she is missing out, and I truly want her to be as happy as she can be.**

During a brief breakup between us, Rachel told me she had sex with my boyfriend after his divorce and before he met me. It apparently only happened once. It is so hard to look at them the same. Thomas doesn't know anything about it. Rachel will never tell him. I told her I wouldn't tell my boyfriend I knew about it. 

Even though it happened before he met me, I just don't know what to think about it. He slept with his best friend's wife. Now whenever all four of us spend time together that's all I can think about. He never has given me reason to think he has cheated on me, but if he could do that to Thomas what makes our situation different? I just need an outsider's opinion I guess. Should I talk to him about it and get his side of the story? Or should I just let it sit in the back of my mind? I guess I shouldn't let it affect our relationship, but it still bothers me.

12521,Relationships,1og76l,"So at the beginning of this year I met a girl through a hobby who used to go to my school, and right from the start I got along with her better than any other girl.

She had a boyfriend at the time, but it seemed their relationship was drawing to a close, she would talk to me about it alot. When he found out about me we were still strictly friends, but he didn't want her to continue to hang out with me, however she did.

It progressed to the point where we were hanging out every other day, and at the end of the school year she ended up breaking up with her bf.

Two nights later we were drunk and sleeping over at a friends and she asked me to cuddle and we did for the rest of the night.

From than on we eventually became FWBs with a little persuasion from me, we were really into each other but at the same time in denial of it. Whenever we hung out with other people the attraction was obvious and although we denied it it was easy to see that something was going on. 

Then it took a turn for the worse, she asked me one day what I thought about us seeing other people, and I wasn't really a fan of it, but there wasn't anyone at the time so I didn't really say anything, I think this was the first hiccup, but we still remained great friends and the sex continued.

We also went to a music festival together where she seemed pretty detached and resentful at times which was weird. 

At the end of the summer we were together less and less, I came over one night to pick up some study books from her and we made out for a bit, and the next night when we were in her basement watching a movie together she couldn't have been less interested in me. 

I got pretty upset about that and we had a conversation about it and decided maybe it was best that we dropped the whole sex thing from the relationship, which was fine by me, I really enjoy just hanging out with her.

The day before she left for Uni we kissed so I was pretty confused at that point. She promised she would text me pics of her outfits and what not and other cute stuff like that but never did.

While she was at uni I texted her every few days at first then maybe once a week, she rarely started conversation and it was always me making the effort. She assured me over text one day that she wanted to remain friends so I kept going.

Then after a while of not texting because I had left the ball in her court for a bit I learned she was in town for a bit and hadn't told me, I texted her and was pretty cold and told her I needed to drop some stuff off at her house, when I did she acted all cute and flirty but I was pretty cold, at the end she said she'd text me more and when she came back in two weeks she'd like to hang out.

After that I texted her a little in a more upbeat manner, but she was pretty cold over text.

She never intitiated a conversation and the weekend when she said we should hangout has passed with no word from her. 

I really miss my best friend, the sex was great, but I would give it up in a second to just have what we used to back. 

I don't know what to do, I spend so much time thinking about her and about the situatuion and I feel like she probably doesn't. I don't know if I should just text her something like hope you had a great weekend or just leave it and get on with my life or confront her about it and try to figure things out.

12522,Relationships,2epe17,"So I meet this girl several months ago and attraction is instant, fireworks, blah blah, she gets me, all that wonderful shit.  She was always a blast to hang out with, always thrilled to see me -- again, all that wonderful shit.  We shared interests, did awesome things, activities, the whole thing.  However, recently (the past few weeks), she has struck many nerves with me and I am really starting to lose attraction with what she is doing.  For example:

1) Lives at home rent free and treats parents like shit.

2) Constantly relying on a chemical to get through the day -- caffiene, weed, alcohol, anti-depresents, adhd medicine -- I almost have to doubt her mood constantly because I don't know what's really her.  I also get very skittish around anti-depressants since I grew up with an abusive, depressed mother.

3) Always, always, always right.

4) Plans she used to be super gung-ho about only weeks ago she now brushes off -- doesn't matter if I have tickets or not.  She started to shrug sex more and more.

5) She never once asks me how I'm doing, how my day was.  I have two jobs: one I'm super super passionate about and I had to do a shit ton to get it and the other one (also passionate) is very dangerous.  She just kind of brushes off what I say when I want to talk to her about it.  It kills me on the inside.  I feel like I can't talk to her anymore.


Well aware the Honey-moon phase is over!  I have brought these topics up to her twice and she gets all upset, says she is doing enough and retracts.  I don't want to (refuse to) be the changer -- that annoying person in the relationship who always wants to change everything about the other person.  She emphatically says that she won't change.  However, if this continues and the attraction declines anymore, I won't even be able to look at her, let alone make plans -- something I stopped doing.  

I'm aware that I'm a critical person, but I don't want to throw away something that was good for a few weeks of bumpiness.  I don't even know what caused the bumpiness, despite me asking her, since she refused to give me a solid answer.  Is this normal for people our age or am I just a harsh dude?  Can I have some insight to maybe reverse this trend?

12526,Relationships,2g0nos,"I recently moved with my girlfriend to a new town. She is starting school for a career change and I decided I could support her and avoid the LDR thing. I love her very much but I didn't think the relationship would go anywhere being that far apart. 


Before the move she supported me wholeheartedly in my job and in improving myself. It was amazing she had a way of getting the best out of me and I in turn put tons of effort into the relationship and becoming a better person. I quit smoking pot, became a much better communicator(which has also helped me at work), and now have moved hours away from my nearest family and friends.


Leading up to the move she became increasingly stressed about everything from her program, what her family would think and of course money. In order to soothe her fears a bit we set up a savings account for the necessary expenses and then some for emergencies. I supported her 100% letting her know I had complete faith in her(which I do the new field is perfect for her) and I offered to tell her family about the move with her. My upbringing taught me that little things like showing up to family functions, being polite, honest and courteous add up to respect. It did her family love me and treat me as one of their own. So they are willing to let the living in sin thing slide.


Still she became even more stressed which culminated in her rolling her ankle on the first day of the move. Why? Because she was too busy chewing me out for putting boxes in the wrong place. The brunt of the move fell on her brother and my shoulders. Through which she continued to harp on us both despite his threats to leave.


After we were moved in she calmed down at bit. However she would still go off on me for leaving a light on in a room or trying to place my things where they could be seen and used. All of my items were apparently meant to go to the very back of our darkest closets. I'm not talking tacky decorations or bad posters either I'm talking about the kettle for my coffee and my combs and razors. 


Any attempt by me to address these issues is met with a litany of things I've apparently done wrong over the whole relationship but not heard of until now. Just getting her to to unpack all of her boxes took three polite asks and a fight. Now that she is fully in school again things are worse than ever. She has crazy mood swings and is eating terribly which I'm sure isn't helping. She admitted to pushing people away and finally that she was part of the problem. However when I asked her to talk to a councillor at school she just said that they always call her parents and that she wasn't willing to do it.


I'm more depressed than I was living unemployed at my parents house 4 years ago. The only person I know here is my girlfriend and she just sits in the bedroom watching orange is the new black and pretending to do homework. God forbid I interrupt that so I talk to strangers on the bus to work. I cook, clean, listen and I'm willing to change myself to make this work but I'm getting none of that from her side. The sex is great, her parents love me, she loves my cooking, I rarely drink and no longer smoke. I'm running out of things to improve upon and she won't even consider the smallest changes.


She seems to think her being stressed gives her the right to be a horrible person. Even going so far as to say I told you I would be stressed when school started every time she snaps at me. I'm tired of apologising for fights she started.

So me and my girlfriend met at my graduation in South America about a year ago. We kind of got together over the summer while I was there because we wanted something casual and fun. But quickly we realized that we were two very compatible people and we didn't want to let eachother go when I had to come back to my home country.

So fast forward to now and we're still together just long distance, it's all going pretty well really and we're very happy with each other except one thing..... I feel like I'm in a total cuckhold. 

Right now I feel like I am **absolutely desperate for sex, like I am a balloon that will burst.** Why do I feel this way? Firstly, she demands that we are exclusive, no matter distance or circumstance. Secondly she refuses to send me nudes or anything even the slightest bit stimulating to remind me of her. I've suggested her sending me some about 6 times and every time she refuses and I wait a few weeks and try again. Thirdly if I try to talk to her about any kind of sexual theme she just does one of two things:

1: I'm bored of this theme, let's talk about something else. If I don't change the topic of conversation she'll get mad

2: Gets insanely jealous thinking I'm cheating on her or that those bitches in your home country are all over you (I think she knows she's not pleasing me, and for that she worries)

Now the thing is I could probably let this go and just wait and wait and wait in a normal situation but I feel super desperate and on edge and ready to do something stupid. Recently a female friend messaged me on fb after not talking to me for years and said Yeaah me and Joe (Her boyfriend) have started sleeping together but in the last three months he's only had sex with me twice. He's been too interested in his games and I don't feel I've had enough attention. So being the clueless male I am I took no hint and went over to see her and before I know it she asked to sit on me. I thought nothing of it, friends sit on eachother right? And then she starts grinding her gigantic bubble butt against me as I start to go erect and runs her hands down my legs and I'm sitting there freaking out but (secretly) enjoying it because I didn't see it coming at all and I feel like I'm getting none. So then she starts saying Ooooh gosh I'm just so horny excuse me and my heart body and soul is telling me to rail her and she asks for a massage so horny me complies.... Then she starts to go down on me and that was when the moral compass turned back on and I just had to stop her, I couldn't do it, I love my girlfriend too much.

So now here's the thing, I went home and got online and told my girlfriend about this crazy girl from high school that I dated who makes up stories to try to ruin all my future relationships who will probably tell you about us playing around together but it never happened. And now my girlfriend ABSOLUTELY HATES this girl who's actually a good friend of mine. In her own words; Don't let me near her when I get there, I'll slit her throat if she really does the kind of damage to you that you just said. So yeah, I'm an idiot that just created a super complicated situation.

Ok so now I don't want to threaten my own girlfriend by saying something like If you don't satisfy me I'm off to bang another girl or send me nudes or we're done because she has a tendency to be super jealous and protective and I think it would just do her over. Also I don't want to destroy a potentially great thing just because I'm horny. The other thing is that in latin america there seems to be this belief that men can do no wrong and if a man cheats, it's because the woman didn't please him enough, it's her fault and she wholeheartedly believes that. She said if I cheat on her that it will be a bad day for the girl, yet she said nothing about what she'd do to me.

Anyway I apologize if this came out as a rant because it kind of is because I'm just really stupid and confused without any idea what to do. Also, writing this makes this whole situation seem really stupid and makes me look like an asshole holy damn.

12529,Relationships,25xtup,"Hi all. I've been dating this man for 8 months. He broke up with said ex around 2 years ago (they dated 3 years). I never met her, but I had learned of her name through his friends. He had never told me her name, but it had come up in casual conversation separately, so he didn't know I knew her name. No biggie, I don't care about ex gfs.


Anyway, post-sex he calls me her name. Accidents happen, but I called him on it since he tried to ignore it to see if I didn't notice. I said:


Me: Did you just call me [Random name]? 

Him: Huh? I didn't just say that, did I? 

Me: Yes, you just called me [Random girl name]. Tell me the truth, is that an ex's name? (I knew full-well this was his ex, I just wanted him to admit it)

Him: No, it isn't an ex. I don't think I even know a person named that... so weird I said that name!


That's when I got pretty upset (internally, I get quiet when upset). I wasn't mad that he called me an ex, I was mad he was dishonest. I became silent and he said to not be mad, it was an accident. After a minute I told him I believed he was lying about it not being an ex's name and he looked shocked and came clean saying he didn't want to admit he had called me his ex's name and had freaked out.


Question, Reddit: Should I be upset? I haven't spoken to him since the incident (at work now). Not sure how to handle this one. Thoughts? I'm a bit hurt about the lie.

He is generally very mature and sweet. I've asked that our relationship be truthful and honest and it feels to have been to this point. I just don't like that he looked me deadpan in the face and said he wasn't lying. Ouch.

My boyfriend and I started dating 8 months ago. We met online about 3 years ago and had been close ever sense. The relationship is long distance (East to West coast USA) but we've been taking the strides to make it work and its been wonderful. We made plans for me to fly to see him the first week of summer. I did, and the trip was perfect and the last day we talked about me coming to visit again in winter. 

The day after I returned home he called me, crying and saying how he missed me. Upon asking what was wrong he said that after I left he had brought up to his cousins that he lives with [both mid 30's, male, married] the possibility of me moving in with them next yesr after I graduate, at least for a short time to find our own place. The conversation didn't go well. 

They gave him two choices; Break up with me and continue living in the house, paying cheap rent and going to school. Or, move out to find a place for the two of us, which would be close to impossible as the city he's in is ridiculously expensive and it would stop him from being able to afford school. Their reasoning is that he had originally moved in with them earlier last year so he could afford to go to school, and they believe being in a relationship will inhibit that plan.

We haven't gotten much chance to talk since this happened last week. I want to bring up to him the possibility of waiting for me to be able to move on my own next year. He said he would like that, but we didnt get to fully discuss the work required and if its something we're both willing to do. He hasn't talked to me in a few days, so I'm being left in the dark. 

Im sure the idea will pop up in this thread as well, but many of my friends believe that maybe I was played, and this is an elaborate way of ending it. Ive thought about it, but I can't allow myself to believe he would do that after everything we've been through to be together. 

Everything has just been taking its toll on me both emotionally and physically. I can't sleep without nightmares, can't eat without feeling sick, and I constantly feel I'm on the verge of breaking into tears. Any advice, or even just kind words will be greatly appreciated.

12531,Relationships,2f5eih,"Three months ago, I met my current girlfriend. Things were fine for the first few weeks, until her (foster) parents were involved in a tragic car accident that too both of their lives. Obviously, she still feels the pain to this day. This was three months ago, when we first met...it's also worth mentioning that she's lived with her biological mother for the past year. She grew up in foster care, which has obviously produced some serious abandonment issues, among other things. Her biological family is a mess. He mother is a recovering alcoholic and her father (they're divorced, btw) is a drug dealer...

I was there for her, although the timing was bad, I still tried my best to take care of her. From the grief to the acceptance, I stood by her. She's coping with it a lot better now, although there are still some weeks where she's a wreck, and understandably so. The people who raised her passed away, nobody truly recovers from that.

The thing is, it's been hard for me, although I haven't shown her much of that in order to stay strong and support her. She's had frequent outbursts, and a lot of the time, they fall onto me. I have a really hard time dealing with her moodiness. For example, one night months ago I decided to have pizza and beer with a few of my friends. Once I got home and told her about my night and how enjoyable it was, she blew up on me. The thing is, I have Crohn's Disease, and if I don't watch my diet extremely carefully, I have pretty bad flare-ups. She started going on and on about how I was treating my body badly. I understood her reasoning, but I told her that I know my limits, to which she responded, I don't care about your limits, you're destroying your body. When you're gone, I won't have anybody left. I limit my alcohol intake to once a week, and my junk food intake to once a month. The majority of my diet is made up of raw vegetables and lean meats and protein shakes, and this isn't really relevant, but her pattern of overreacting to things has followed a pattern for the past few months.

She's a sweet girl, don't get me wrong. I honestly love her to death. But her health is also a concern to me. She is a diabetic, and does not take care of herself. She's gone into diabetic shock a number of times when I've been with her. One time, she pretty much zoned out and turned into a vegetable for an hour. I had no idea what to do but thankfully, she came out of it long enough to get her sugar back up. This has happened a number of times. I'll never forget the night when we were together for a few weeks. He sugar got dangerously low and she told me to take her to the hospital, but halfway to the hospital she told me if you take me to the hospital, I will kill you. Turn around right now. I pulled over and we waited. She was able to come back out of it because I bought her orange juice and we returned to my house, which is when she apologized profusely and said things like, you're too good for me, and things along those lines.

We've fought several times over the most ridiculous things, in my opinion. Once she got upset because I wished my mother a happy birthday on Facebook before I sent her a text message. She said something along the lines of Why do you have time for Facebook but not me? She has also accused me of not making her enough of a priority in my life, which I find ludicrous. I hate social media for this reason because in recent weeks, she has gotten onto me for being online on Facebook when I told her I was going to sleep when I was actually just lying in bed on my phone scrolling through my newsfeed to unwind. Just this morning she called me saying I've been worried sick about you, you're normally up before noon just because I slept in before going to work.

It's also worth noting that we're in two completely different stages of our lives. She just started college this fall and I started my senior year. While I'm taking advanced political science classes, she's in her intro to psychology class. I've got a lot of school work to do and I don't have much time for her, and she gets that most of the time. But she's still worried about me when I can't allocate as much time for her and our relationship. 

She had a panic attack at my house a few weeks ago...it scared the shit out of me. I've had panic attacks as well, so I can't say I don't understand what she went through, but I've been living in fear of what might happen to her next since then. We both suffer from anxiety, although years of therapy have helped me manage mine, she still has her days. Between the panic attacks and diabetic shock, I get scared every time we spend time together. Just thinking to myself, is she going to be okay this time? Will she have an anxiety attack? Will her sugar be too high or too low? Her health is a legitimate concern to me, both as her boyfriend and as a human being. She does not take very good care of herself, which hits me hard because I take my own health and fitness extremely seriously. It's worth noting that she's been taking BETTER care of herself lately, but not to the standard that diabetics should be.

I actually went and saw my therapist after almost a year after one of our fights. It was kind of a wake up call for me. He told me that he was concerned about my state of mind and that I needed to break up with her. I tried once but we were able to talk it out...I often feel that I regret not ending it then. Just the fact that a relationship made me go back into therapy when I was doing just fine says it all...the girl that I almost proposed to had borderline personality disorder, which is what ultimately caused our relationship to end, and I see a lot of what I already went through in this girl. So does my therapist.

I just don't know what to do about this. She's an extremely good person at heart, a total sweetheart. She gives a lot of her earnings to charity and her family members if they need it, and she loves me to death. She tells me every day how much I help her and how much I mean to her, she even gives me little gifts like pictures, cards, and notes. I sincerely believe that this girl is a genuine person deep down. She has a heart of gold. But I don't know if I can take it anymore. I don't know if I can keep watching her fall to pieces, accuse me of not making her a priority.

We click on a personal level for sure. We never run out of things to talk about and we have the same opinions on a lot of political issues, for example. Neither of us are EXTREMELY religious. She considers herself a skeptical Christian and I'm an atheist. She's okay with this. She's also extremely ambitious which is something I look for in a girl. She has her sights set high for herself. But we don't have many interests in common. I'm a tried and true geek and I love a wide variety of music. She can't find her way around a video game controller, complains when I talk about anime, and calls my music silly, while I on the other hand can't stand when she talks about how Taylor Swift is her role model. One of the best experiences I've ever had in a relationship is when she surprised me with Warped Tour tickets and we spent an entire day watching and appreciating bands that we BOTH like, and moments like that are what make me feel like a terrible person for questioning this relationship. I love her, I really do.

She understands that we come from two different backgrounds. She's okay with the fact that until just recently, I got over my ex who I was in a long-term relationship with and almost got married to. She's fine with the fact that I used to be a pack-a-day smoker until I was diagnosed with Crohn's and doesn't judge me for vaping because I can't go without my sweet nicotine. 

One thing that kills me with guilt is that she's a virgin and I'm not, and I'm not ready to take her virginity because I don't want the relationship to go south and have her regret it. She wants me to be the one, she sees a future while I think in terms of the present. I retreat inwards when I have a problem and she's extremely open. She's upset when I don't want to talk about my problems because I prefer to deal with them myself. I'm an introvert and she's the most outgoing person you could possibly meet. But I love her. 

She helped me fix my relationship with my parents through her story. I'm eternally grateful for that and I love my parents to death now. But the fact still remains that I don't know if I can handle this. I don't know what to say to her or what I even want. I've never been good at ending relationships and I know that she wants to stick with me through thick and thin. But I'm burnt out. Even my family sees that. My mother has been telling me to take care of myself, both of my parents know that I'm unhappy. But I can't break this girl's heart and my own. I don't know what to do. Just posting this and getting it all out there has been cathartic. But I still want advice. What should I do, guys?

tl;dr: I love my girlfriend, but she has a lot of issues that I'm simply not equipped to handle, or ready to handle. She's a great person but I don't feel like I can handle her a lot of days. I'm losing touch with myself over this relationship but I can't let her go either.

Essentially, she was supposed to go out with a male friend [17 M] of her's yesterday afternoon. Do note that this guy has tried to sexually assault her 3 times in the past (both attempts were within the past 6 months, and ended with a forced make out session). However, they still remain as friends and as much as I talk to her about him, she remains adamant about retaining their friendship. This is the first time they are meeting up since our relationship started, and she informed me the day before that they were going out. I said nothing. 
The next day, I called her landline to check if she was out (she was supposed to go out with him by the time I called). However, her mother picked up the phone instead and said that she was asleep. I did not wake her up, and put down the phone. When she woke up, she was furious that I did not wake her up, even though it was me who told her that I had called. Now, she has blocked my number and deleted me off all social media. Please help, I have no idea what to do. Am I at fault here or is she simply overreacting?

So I was DJ'ing at the bar we met at as a favor to the owner the day after valentines day. She came in with her boyfriend, only to come over to let me know that they had broken up the night before on Valentines day. They live together, she has kids(not his). She wanted to get out of the house and he wanted to come with. She says the breakup was amicable, but the night out was awkward. Afterwards, we talked about getting together for a date(her idea). Went out for a date on friday. And have another date set.  

In the midst of all this we've talked. Apparently not only has she broke up with her live in boyfriend, she quit her job, and she is looking for a new place to move to.

So what I'm wondering, that all seems like some relatively big lifestyle changes.  Is this going to turn into some kind of rebound thing where she realizes it's a huge change or a mistake or something?

12536,Dating,2ip7pu,"So my girlfriend and i started dating about 5 months ago. She had just broken up finally with this abusive guy she had been seeing on and off since high school. Since then we've done pretty well. We never argue, we share a ton of the same interests, we're always super sweet to each other, and we have sex pretty often. But i'm beginning to worry that i'm lying to myself and that there are issues that i haven't been addressing or telling her about.

First, she is a very passive person. When we hang out i initiate conversation way more often than her. She always has me choose where we go to eat or what we do when we're hanging out (choosing what we watch on netflix, etc). I've asked her about it, and tried to get her to speak her mind more often, i ask her opinion on stuff and it's like pulling teeth to get her to express herself. I give her choices like do you want pizza or seafood and sometimes that'll get her to choose. But she's just super passive, especially when we hang out with other people. 

I get the vibe that she has things to say, but she is afraid of saying something that she thinks other people think is stupid. I totally get that. I've been there. So i constantly try to reaffirm her. My friends pretty much constantly tell me stuff like oh your girlfriend seems really quiet but once i started talking to her she was really nice. I tell her how all my friends like her a lot and that they want to get to know her more, and she says she really likes them, but more often than not i just feel like she's saying that.

A lot of times when she says something, she won't finish her thought and she'll just trail off into mumbling and eventually just says never mind. I ask her to finish what she's saying and she just says it's stupid. Or when she says a joke, it's usually really funny and cute, but afterwards she always says that it's stupid. I'm almost positive either her ex boyfriend, or maybe an abusive parent conditioned her to always think what she says is stupid. 

She tells me she's afraid of everything, and i don't know what i can do to help her with that. I tried to get her to do all sorts of things with me, cliff diving, raw squid, roller coasters, etc. She says they're really cool and that she'd totally try them, but once we get there to the theme park or restaurant or the cliff or whatever, she gets really freaked out. She even gets freaked out about spiders. We don't even live in an area that has an indigenous species of poisonous spider.

As for the sex, we are attracted to each other but she's way too timid in bed. Her ex boyfriend was some hardcore punk dude that treated her like shit so i'm guessing he probably also treated her like shit in the bedroom too. I encourage her to be more aggressive in bed but i don't think she feels comfortable just going for it. I would never cheat on her but i feel more and more unsatisfied sexually.

Recently i've caught myself looking at other girls on campus and at work and even when she and i are out together. I fantasize about being with someone who's outspoken and outgoing and spontaneous. I feel like i have a very energetic and frenetic personality at times and i need to be with someone who can match my energy. If i did leave her, i'd probably stay alone for a while (i'll probably not date anyone to spend more time focusing on myself, studies, work, eating right and working out- i have that relationship gut, haha), until i felt ready and the right person came along.

The problem is, on paper she's great. She's incredibly kind and generous, even to complete strangers. She would drop everything if i needed her help or needed someone to talk to or got hurt and needed a ride to the emergency room or something like that. She leaves me cute little notes and buys me beer when i cook for her and sends me articles about hiking trails and funny videos of puppies and kittens. 

I tried to break up with her for these reasons about a month and a half ago and she started crying and it broke my heart to watch her like that. I hated myself for even thinking about breaking up with her. I don't want her to hate me, but i don't think that i can be the one to help her stop being timid and afraid of everything and being full of self doubt, so i really don't know what to do.

**tl;dr**: GF is constantly timid in social situations, afraid of everything, doesn't speak her mind, full of self doubt, etc. I overlooked these issues when we started dating because i really liked her and put her on a pedestal.

12537,Relationships,27b1f7,"Some background: Due to personal issues I'm currently not in school and I am looking for a job. I'll admit I haven't been great about it, but it's been difficult for me to raise up the confidence to really go out there, especially after the promising interviews I've had so far that ended in disappointment. Lately I've just been feeling so worthless, like some lazy, unskilled dumbshit, and my SO hasn't done much to make me feel better. Also, we've been living together throughout our relationship, we got pretty serious pretty fast.

Rewind to when we were first dating and my SO is in the EXACT same position I am currently in. Not attending school, out of work but not entirely looking, feeling down, etc. while I was in school. I tried all I could to comfort her; I supported her financially (even though I wasn't working either, thank tha lord for financial aid), emotionally and I never brought her down about it. I was even cooking and cleaning up after us like almost constantly. It wasn't until her 3rd month that she was actively looking and at the end of it she had a job.

Fast forward to now, I have been out of work for two months and have still been contributing financially because she has other expenses to deal with, plus I've still been doing most of the cooking and cleaning if not all of it. I'm ok with helping for now because fortunately my father offered to help me with my first two months and I know she doesn't have that benefit. 

However, about a month ago an opportunity came up where if she had decided to recommend me I would have a job, like right now, working with her doing restock at some place. She didn't want me to and I understand why; we live together and are with eachother most of the time so I see where she would want some space for herself. Recently though, as I've become more desperate for a job, I asked her again and she replied with no again.

This hurts/ upsets me for a few reasons. The first one being that she put in a recommendation for our other housemate who was looking for a 2ND job, as well as some guy who lived with our old housemates in return for his help on a flower bed she was building. She didn't even LIKE the second guy, she thought he was kind of an asshole yet she would still prefer to work with him than me. (By the way, they both started working there the same week as their apps and interviews thanks to her recommendation)

If she changed her mind and decided to recommend me it would be a temporary thing to hold me over until I can find two other jobs, and I've told her this. I've also asked her various times to help me with text portions of applications because I'm so bad at it, and am afraid to turn them in otherwise. She usually gets annoyed with me after a little while, like most other things that require her to have some patience with me, and she says she feels like she doing all the work and it brings me down and I start feeling like a dumb shit again.

Her response to me was If you had been looking more these past months I'd feel more sorry for you, but you haven't even turned that many in. To which I replied It's not about feeling sorry for me, it's just about wanting to help me. I don't have as many skills as you, I don't sound as impressive in an interview (which reading back sounds silly, on my part). To this she replied It's not that I don't want to, but I prefer not to. How about I help you find some jobs and fill out applications? If you read the above paragraph, I hope you're not surprised to learn that it didn't sound like too great of an offer to me.

I could have really used this break; to bring up my confidence, strengthen my skills, get back into a working routine, but I guess I'd just be getting a job handed to me while she found it through her own efforts, right? I can see why she wouldn't want to recommend me for this reason. The thing that sucks though is that I know deep down in my heart that if the roles were reversed I would have recommended her in a heartbeat, knowing that the job market in our area is total shit and I'd have some comfort knowing she'd be in a good environment to get back on her feet. But I guess people never REALLY know what they would do unless they were in that position. I just wish I  could feel like she's there for me, like I try to be for her.

Feeling like a depressed shit lately, and my SO refuses to put a word in for me (but not my housemate or some random asshole) at her work that would guarantee me a job.

12538,Relationships,2rr120,"So we met online and at the time she lived with her host family who lived close to me. We had an amazing first date which turned into two great months, and she's honestly one of the most intelligent, clever, funny, and beautiful women I've ever met. But, that's not the problem.

She was originally supposed to go back to Spain this year as her visa was due to expire, but she found a new host family 100+ miles away in another state. It's like a 2 1/2 hour drive from me which isn't too bad. She loves her new family and is enjoying the new city she is in. I speak Spanish okay, and her English is amazing. So we talk in a mix of both which I find adorable. I am supposed to drive down there saturday and spend the night with her which I am incredibly excited for.

My problem is that I'm not sure how to proceed with this relationship. We are very close and have already exchanged Te Amos &amp; I love you's. Had an amazing Christmas together. She bought me an amazing pair of boots and wrote me a 3 page letter en Espanol professing her love for me. I was melted with feelings, and I've never felt this kind of thing for anyone, even my ex of 6 years. 

But the future is incredibly uncertain for us. She loves America and has told me many times she would live here with me together. But at the same time I don't want to keep her from her parents who love her very much (I've spoken with them on Skype and they seem like great people, hope to meet them someday soon). She has met my parents and they all get along great. We are both only childs and share many of the ideals about life, politics, religion and whatever. We are literally on the same page about everything except for the future.

So what should I do? Keep this relationship long distance, only seeing her a few times a month, with the possibility of her going back to Spain next year? I really like her and she likes me too. We have a very deep connection unmatched by any other woman I've ever met over my 10 years on the dating scene. I would honestly drop my career in America to take up a life in Spain with her. It's a very weird feeling. Sorry this is scattered. Just need some advice if any is possible.

12539,Breakups,2vrtbs,"I met this girl last September. It was my last semester of college and she was studying abroad next semester (aka this semester.) We admitted we had strong feelings for each other pretty soon after meeting, but she said because of studying abroad she didn't want anything serious. I told her I agreed, even though that wasn't really true.

Over the course of the next few weeks, we had a very turbulent relationship. Most days would be great, we'd text nonstop about literally anything and get extremely close from knowing so much about each other. She told me about her father having cancer and how hard it was for her to deal with it, and we grew even closer. There would be a few nights when she'd stay at my house, but we'd do nothing more than watch movies and kiss before falling asleep. The other side of the coin is that there would be intermittent days when she would be distant and tell me that she's having trouble with our situation, because her feelings for me are too strong to sustain this sort of impermanent thing we had. I kept telling her that while it sucks I'd rather have her now and lose her in three months than lose her now. She'd always agree.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving break. One night she sends me a picture of a note she meant to send to me at a later date, but decided to text instead. The note essentially expressed how much I meant to her. After reading it I wanted to see her right then and there, so I drove to her house at around midnight to pick her up. That night we had sex in my car. This was the first time I'd ever had sex with someone I cared so deeply about, which is certainly part of the reason I'm having so much trouble letting go. A few days later, she again expresses how she's having trouble with our situation when her feelings are so strong. I persuade her again to keep going.

Another week or so passes and one night when we're back at school, she stays over and we have sex again. Everything seems fine. Then school ends, but she lives close to me at home and has another month before leaving for Europe, so we both make plans to see each other. However, she becomes extremely distant again. I ask her what's wrong and she says she promises it has nothing to do with me and that she still cares about me, but that she needs a little bit of time alone (things with her Dad and emotions about leaving her friends for three months were boiling over.) I say ok, and while we don't see each other our conversations go back to normal, flirty and revealing. I send her a Christmas gift and she tells me how much she loves it and how much I mean to her. About a week later she tells me she's going to New York for the weekend. At this point, her texts to me have been pretty distant and unfamiliar for about a week. After the weekend, I text her asking how her weekend went before addressing how our conversations have changed for the worse. She tells me it's because she has feelings for someone else and she didn't know how to tell me. 

A week passes without me saying anything, because I'm absolutely crushed, but then I text her telling her how hurtful the way she ended things was. I told her the fact that she not only did it so abruptly but also didn't say a thing afterwards proved she was basically lying to my face every time she told me how much I meant to her. She responds saying that she didn't say anything after ending it because she thought it best to get out of my life and not hurt me any more than she already had. She also said that she'll never deny that her feelings for me were extremely real. She said feelings change but that doesn't take an ounce away from what we had. I tell her I want to believe her and that I guess I couldn't put blame on her for her feelings not matching up with my expectations.

Here's my problem:

It's been about a month. She's been in Europe for about half that time. I'm not really over her. I want to be able to not just get over her but also possibly even talk to her. Some days I acknowledge that maybe she didn't really do anything wrong, but most days I'm just mad at her. Mad that feelings she claimed were so strong could evaporate instantaneously. Mad that she was having trouble with our situation because of its impermanence, but that she still somehow has feelings for someone else (despite the impermanence still being an issue.) 

A few days after getting to Europe she texted me saying Hey. I hope you're doing ok. I wore your Christmas present today and wanted to tell you that. I didn't know what to say and was honestly pretty pissed at her so I just said I'm glad. She responded by asking how it was going and I just said Fine. I appreciate her trying to be friends but I'm still mad at her. Every time she says something like Hope you're doing ok. it comes off as patronizing, like I can't possibly be ok without her but that she hopes I'm trying. I want to try and get over it and even for her sake, but that's just it; it would be purely for her sake and if I'm being honest I don't think she deserves that from me right now. 

I guess what I really need is advice on getting over her. I've never been in a relationship and this was the closest I've come to it, and it still really hurts a month later. I also want to know if I should even bother trying to be friends, because I think that might hurt even more. Like she ended it with me and I'm still here begging for some sort of contact. She seems perfectly fine with not talking to me and I'd love to feel the same way.

TL;DR: I was with a girl I truly cared about for the first time in my life, and she ended it by telling me there was someone else, even though her feelings for me when we were together were completely real. How do I get over her? How do I stop being mad at her? Should I even try being friends with her?

We have been broken up just over a month now and she is making things a lot harder than they need to be, I used to contact her quite a lot and she seemed okay we could have normal conversations, but since I went out with some friends she for whatever reason seems she to have been trying her hardest to hurt me in whatever way she can, this means her daily postings about me on her tumblr blogs to try to hurt me and she also does things such as posting pretty images of herself and then getting Anonymous comments saying how pretty she is then bragging about how many likes she has on them. I maybe wrong but knowing her this seems to be aimed at effecting me. She also seemed a bit depressed on her blogs from her posts I could tell she felt a bit lonely yet this seems to be a very normal things for her due to the end of our relationship and I figure it's something she will get over. 


But that said and done not everything she has posted has been directly aimed at me, there is only a few things. However last night she contacted me and I didn't really wanna speak as I know she was in a mood where she wanted to hurt me, but I replied as I did not want to be rude, and she started talking about my friends and how I have such a better Social Life now Im not with her. I didn't brag in anyway and I tried to tell her this was not the case at all and actually this was due to a lot of my friends coming home from UNI. Still she kept asking questions about my friendships which I answered.

When I was going to bed I realized a note she put onto her tumblr blog.

*Why is it always a contest about who is most popular? A competition of who is having the best times? Will this matter if i disappear tomorrow?  If i never speak to you again? What if I disappeared?*

She has self harmed once and that was months ago and I believe this may of been for attention due to the way it was set out. I have spoke to her about suicide last month and she said that she has only ever been suicidal once two years ago and she was not suicidal currently and I have nothing to worry about. A month later I don't know how she is, yet she does know that this bothers me.

I'm not sure if she is being serious and is at serious risk of harm or if she will ignore me for a few days now to make it seem as if she has Disappeared to get a reaction but will remain safe?

My friend advised me that this is just a cry for attention and should be ignored and if she was doing something serious its doubtful she would post it at all.

Thanks very much.

Its been smooth sailing thus far and actually quite easier than i had expected, especially because we've made numerous plans for the upcoming summer. However she just recently decided to find a job out west for the summer rather than return home. If she does work out west we wouldn't see each other for roughly the next 17 months minimum outside of one week at the beginning of summer and one week at christmas. She is rather shy about articulating her emotions and thoughts ergo has not been open to discussion this fact. I am really bothered than it seems she's excluded me in her decision making process and has shut down my attempts to discuss it. I'm reluctant to tell her that i have been mildly depressed since she told me the news because i don't want to seem selfish and truthfully without the foreseeable plans this summer i think it will add a lot more difficulty to coping with the distance. It is also not possible for me to move out west this summer as I must save for school next year and currently hold a position at a much higher paying job than i could find elsewhere.

12544,Relationships,3c7afi,"I'm hoping for advice perspective since i know its possible I am the one who needs to change.

Here's the issue: Although she has an IUD, I have been uncomfortable having sex in the last year without also using a condom, unless I pull out.

We both struggled with that, but both felt it was better than nothing until we sorted things out. Now, she's had enough and doesn't want sex, flirting, or intimacy at all until I accept that her IUD is sufficient enough birth control. She feels condoms kill the intimacy and closeness she needs from sex.

I **desperately** don't want to use a condom either. But here's why I have felt the need to:

**Backstory**

I've been married for just over 2 years now. Most of it has been a roller-coaster, since she has a history of not treating me well and there's a lot of drama. She can be very anxious and its common that she takes stress out on me, so i walked on eggshells a lot. Occasional verbal/emotional abuse.

I brought us to counseling a year ago, and its helped in ways, and in others not. 

So... to me, any possible chance of bringing a child into this relationship is not okay to me. Not until there is long term, sustained behavioral change and the relationship improves.

To me, occasional sex with a condom, or pulling out is at least better for helping us grow close again than a dead bedroom.

But now that's what I have. I'm scared of that destroying the relationship further, even though that's not her goal.

However, I also want to be open to ME needing to change. Like my wife tells me, maybe both an IUD and a condom together is overkill. Am I shooting myself in the foot by being so hesitant about sex with just an IUD in this situation?

Thanks for any advice.

**tl;dr**: Married 2 years. Wife has an IUD, but because of a rocky relationship and history of not treating me well, I have been using a condom as well. I feel it supremely irresponsible to have any chance of bringing a child into the picture. But, sex is important.

Now she has cut off all sex until I stop using a condom since she thinks its overkill and ruins the intimacy of sex.

Within the past couple months, her and I started talking and hanging out often. Our relationship has turned sexually active, and even though it has not been spoken, we are exclusive. We both see eye to eye on most everything, and share the same feelings toward each other. As of now, we both live in the DC area, and can see each other often. This will be changing within a month or so. She will be leaving for medical school at the end of April. In Chicago. 


I have been single for a very long time, (almost 8 years) and yes enjoying it. I am really into her and her choices in life. She makes me feel important, and without saying anything. Makes me strive to be a better person. 


She took a work trip to China 2 weeks ago, and on her plane ride there, she wrote a 2 page description of me. What she likes. It made me cry, and laugh. It was the most adorable thing I had ever read. She tells me I do not give myself enough credit, and she wants to fill that void. 


I don't know if she is the one, but is certainly someone I am very proud of. and trust. I could see myself with her for a very long time. We chose not to put a title on our relationship due to her leaving soon. She told me that while she is gone, I am free to do whatever I want as long as I don't tell her. As tempting as that sounds, I feel I cannot do that. I feel she is too important to hurt. Even if she was never told. 


So, how do I handle this? utilize facetime, and talk as often as possible? Make trips as often as possible? Or let her go, and see what the future holds? It's going to be very difficult, and I am so lost on what to do. She is an amazing person inside and out.

She just got out of a 5 year relationship that was extremely unhealthy and where she was not happy at all. This man seems to make her very happy, and I want her to be happy, but I am so not cool with infidelity.

I have talked with her briefly about what her expectations are in this relationship, and at this point, she seems to just want to have fun with it. This man makes a very good amount of money and is helping to support some of her life financially, which also worries me.

His wife is suspicious that he is cheating and suspects that it might be my friend that he is cheating with. She tells me constantly how crazy his wife is and that he doesn't love her and that they were forced to get married because she got pregnant.

12547,Relationships,31l10u,"Being only 17, I'm fairly new to the dating scene, which could take away from what I should really be expecting out of a relationship.

A little background, my current girlfriend(soon to be 18) and I have 'known' each other since the beginning of the school year in August due to band, and we've just grown as friends since then until it escalated in December when we really started talking. We were planning to go to the same college. I liked her, I found out she liked me, I asked her out. We are 3 months into our relationship, and I feel like I'm putting in more than I get out. Despite how much I don't know about dating, I understand relationships go both ways in how much should be contributed. I am also questioning whether or not it's too early to say this.

In the halls at school, much of the time we are holding hands, which she would usually initate, but recently I've been the one to do that more. Without fail she gives me a quick kiss on the lips goodbye every day before her first class(she's a senior and I'm a junior). Outside of school, we've met up quite a few times, I've offered up/organized all but one of them, when her friend from out of town wanted to meet me. For Valentine's Day, we bought each other gifts, flowers, the whole shebang. Much of the time up to the month 2 mark we'd text/snapchat back and forth mostly every day, I always make sure to send her goodnight texts, which she would reply(but never initiated except for once or twice), and sometimes I'll send her little texts to remind her I'm thinking about her or I hope she's having fun/a good shift/etc. Most of my Christmas stipend and the money I received for helping clean and paint her house was spent on her. In fact, her birthday gift(in June) is sitting on my desk right now and she is fully aware of this. For a while, we've been settled out of the honeymoon stage and we simply aren't as glued to the hip as we were before. The past couple weeks however, I feel like there's been a change.

For instance, the communication outside of school has slowed down greatly, as have the dates(but that could be caused by her new part time job). Again, whenever we do have a date, it's because I asked her if she wanted to, never because she initiated it. Last date a week ago was the kicker.
With her constantly signing up for scholarships and her mother on her behind about it 24/7, she had been stressed. I thought she was fine at the beginning, but I had misread the movie time online as an hour later, and she got mad at me. We went to the park to wait for the next possible time to see the movie, which quickly turned into me waiting in the car because she didn't want to talk to me and was just frowning at her phone, texting. About what, who knows at this point. We left afterwards for the theater, and there wasn't really any romance beyond that point. I tried putting my arm around her and I was refused, additionally during the first half of the movie she texted her friend. Again, about who knows what. I even reached out to the person I thought she was texting(during the movie, and you better bet she didn't see me do it, she didn't throw a glance the whole time), and I was told just to be patient and they hoped it would work out, and when I got the words You and DerLuftwaffe's Girlfriend are cute together, my heart just sank for the rest of the time. Now, throughout the date I had been asking her what was bothering her, in a soft tone, trying to help her, but this and other stupid things I had done such as missing the movie time made her even more pissed at me. At the end of the date, I told her I felt rejected and for the last time I asked what was going on. She told me that in addition to scholarships, she thought she had to baby me due to my actions, being bad at social cues, etc. and that I shouldn't be looking at her phone anyway(since I guessed right on which friend she was texting long messages to). She also told me that she was texting about just ranting to her about scholarship stuff, but I am a bit slow to believe that. I gave her a long sorry for my errors, and that I would try my best to man up and I said goodbye to her. No kiss. Needless to say, this bad date piled onto me showing more affection than I got out really got me thinking about the status of our relationship rather than just being blindly in puppy-love.

It feels childish to say, but after that I realized with all the things I've been doing, maybe I should be receiving more than I'm putting in, which is already quite a bit. I've been trying to think of new and exciting things we can try for dates, trying to reignite a bit of her affection by making out(last time was a little less than a month ago?) but I feel as if there is more effort from my end of this than hers, if any at all. As of late I have been the one to initiate conversations over text or come up with date ideas. I'm not sure what to think about this, as I have no idea what's been going through her mind during these past couple weeks, she hasn't acquired any new guy friends or anything like that to my knowledge. She's been eating healthier and started exercising a lot more since we've been dating, as well. I'm more solid on my thought that our relationship is more one sided than that she is disinterested.

Are my concerns legitimate? I'm a bit afraid to say anything because my thoughts might be bogus, and for fear of her getting similar thoughts of me not being interested, because that's certainly not true. How should I go about fixing this problem in our relationship? Oh, and prom is a month away and we've already bought everything for that. Can things last that long?

12549,Relationships,3ct6ni,"**Background** 


My sister prides herself on her stubbornness. She is a self-admitted grudge-holder and believes that that's who she is and other people need to deal with that. 


For example, about 6 or 7 years ago we went out to dinner with one of my friends.  My sister was trying to find something healthy on the menu and my friend teased her about calorie counting. My sister became offended, I think because she felt there was some implication that she had an eating disorder. My sister *still* hates that person even though they haven't spoken since.  In addition, I can't think of a time where my sister has ever apologized for wrong doing on her part. She either tries to justify her actions or just says ok,  or accuses you over overreacting, when you're explaining why you think you deserve an apology until you give up. 


Don't get me wrong, I love my sister. She is smart, a hard worker, and generally loving. Aside from regular sisterly spats growing up, we were very close playmates and confidants as kids.   I don't think she is a bad person or a narcissist (based on my visit to the sub). I just think she views stubbornness as part of who she is as a person. 

In addition, and I don't know if this is relevant but it probably is, my sister and I are half Asian. We come from an asian culture that is pretty big on keeping things between the family. 

I give all of this as background because it's starting to eek into the relationship I have with my boyfriend and the relationship I would like us all to have as a family. 


**More relevant background**


My sisters grudgefullness has extended to her feelings about my boyfriend.  Maybe 2 or 3 years ago there was an issue where I broke my phone. We are on a family plan and she had recently used my upgrade to get a new phone just before this. This resulted in her having a spare. We live in different states, so I asked her to mail me her phone but it was taking a long time to get done.  She was in school at the time, so I know that she was busy, however many of the times I sent her a fb message asking her what she was up to she'd say she was on the beach etc.  I expressed my frustration with this to my boyfriend.  He listened to me complain about it for a few weeks and then decided that he would send my sister an e-mail since my asking her--sternly worded or not--didn't seem to be getting anywhere. 


The e-mail he sent was very polite, in my opinion. It just expressed that he was worried about my safety (I live in a relatively dangerous city) and asked her, as a favor, if she wouldn't send me the phone.  He apologized in the e-mail for asking and offered any help he could provide to her in getting the phone to me. 


She found the e-mail incredibly rude because the phone issue was a matter between family and felt that he should not have gotten involved in anyway.  She has held a grudge against him ever since. 


**Build Up to Current Issue**


My sister has been interning near my city this summer. This has given us a lot of great time to spend together, but it's clear that when the three of us are together there is tension between herself and my boyfriend. 


To be fair to my sister, my boyfriend is an only child with some corresponding only-child tendencies.  He likes to do certain things certain ways, but usually will only push on the issue if it comes down to health or safety.  Both of them can be stubborn and that's  starting to clash as they spend more and more time together. 


For example, over the past weekend we all went out to eat dinner together and brought along our dog. In the place I live there are a lot of restaurants with dog friendly outdoor seating.   We were placed at a three-seat table in a corner with one seat against a wall, one seat with it's back toward the street and one seat between those two with its back toward the entrance to the restaurant. My sister immediately sat in the seat with her back to the wall, because she feels more protected that way.  My boyfriend asked to sit there in order to keep the dog away from the street area and the entrance, where servers would be coming in and out of.  My sister refused to move even after my boyfriend explained his reasoning. He let it go, but he wasn't happy. 


There have been a lot of little things like that. Another example from the past weekend involves the dog too. My sister is in vet school. When she first met our dog she did a pretend check up on her, and we were all great with that. Since then, however, she's kept poking at our dog in ways that obviously (you see the frequent yawns come in) annoy our dog.  We have asked her to stop because it makes the dog uncomfortable but she'll say things like I'm just giving her a check up and don't you want your dog to be healthy. 


To be fair to my sister, my boyfriend isn't perfect either. He likes to listen to certain things on the radio my sister can't stand, and isn't exactly amenable to changing over to her tastes--although I can usually work a compromise between the two of them. He is also a talker/explainer and likes to expound on issues well beyond the need to do so.  This can come off as showy and my sister doesn't appreciate it. 


Because my sister wants to keep family issues between family, I have tried to bring these things up to her in both soft and hard ways.  Any criticism she gets though she'll come back with her actions being an extension of just being herself or if somebody does something rude to me, I'm going to be rude back. 


**Actual Current Issue** 


My boyfriend is, understandably, getting sick of the interaction between them. He has stated that he's not going to sit back and not say anything to my sister anymore.  He thinks he should be able to talk to her like one adult to another and, it's true he should. 


But--and this is the issue--my sister will not respond reasonably and rationally. She will see it as an attack. It will be a full relationship meltdown.  A grudge forever and all time--no matter what issue my boyfriend tries to directly address with her. 


I'm worried about irreparably damaging my relationship with my sister. I'm worried that my sister's framing of this to my parents will harm their relationship with my boyfriend (they took her side on the phone issue).  I don't know how to mitigate successfully between the two of them and I know that direct interaction from my boyfriend to my sister will result in a nightmare. 


Any advice would be very much appreciated.

We have recently come across the opportunity to live together for a few months this summer (house sitting), and I figured this was a great way to see what it would be like if we moved away together, considering I will almost certainly have to move away for grad school in a year or so. So far, I have not been pleased. I feel like I've had to nag her anytime I want her to do her fair share of housework (and even then she often won't), so I've sort of stopped asking and just begrudgingly done it myself. She works less than I do, but it still almost always falls on me to cook and do the dishes and clean up the house when I get back. If I don't do any cooking or cleaning for a few days, she just eats like garbage and ignores the increasingly messy living conditions we're subjected to. It goes without saying that she is quite messy, too. 

I really love her though - we have a lot of fun together, we really understand each other, and we see eye to eye on a lot of important issues. When we weren't living together all I saw was the fun side of a relationship, but I know that any serious relationship eventually involves living together, and it suddenly seems like that aspect of the relationship is measurably suffering. 

I know I should talk to her about this in some way, but I'm not sure *how* to approach it. It's a touchy issue because I think a lot of this laziness stems from depression and similar issues. It makes it harder for me to expect her to help out, because I know it's harder for her to get motivated than it is for me. That said, I still feel like she could be trying more than she is.

I haven't said anything to her yet because I've been treating this as sort of a test, and I feel like mentioning that would temporarily change her behavior until the test was over. I'm not sure I really believe that people can permanently change.

I'm worried that if I stay in the relationship I'll slowly begin to resent her, and all of the things I really do love about her will be pushed out of the picture. So my question boils down to this: is love enough? How can I become more satisfied with this aspect of my relationship? Is it worth it to try to get her to change, or should I cut my losses and move on?

12552,Breakups,37cfax,"So for a bit of a preface, I have an anxiety disorder. It's bad. When we first started dating I had a panic attack almost every week... But then she started helping me and getting me through life... We fell in love and stayed together for almost two years.

I was a year ahead of her so I graduated first. The relationship was stalling and I felt like it was time to end it... But then at my open house I started to get sick. I was really sick for a week or two and she came and helped me and I realized why I loved her.

We were like any other couple... And we loved each other. We planned out how we were going to deal w/her going away for college this year and me staying close to home. Sure there were fights but we always worked through them... We were never vain and we didn't ever tear each other down.

Now she's graduating. So after her last day of school (last Friday) she went and hung out with one of her friends who is a notorious cheater. I was OK with this and didn't really care until I saw her snapchat story... She was at a bonfire and she didn't tell me. She's not the cheating type so I wasn't worried about that... But the fact that she didn't tell me really upset me

When I asked her about it she said that she didn't need to tell me everything and that she needs to do to these 'senior only' parties. I wanted to go too but if she needed space I'd give it to her... Flashforward to yesterday and she came over to watch the memorial day parade with me. We had an ok time but she kept saying her stomach hurt so she left right after. Then she didn't text/call me all day.

This is where everything goes wrong. She finally texts me back and says that she's nervous about summer, college, parties and me. I asked her why she was nervous about me and she wouldn't answer so I called... She said that she only wants to be friends and that she doesn't love me anymore... Even though she said she did before she left my house. I begged her to keep trying like I did when I was graduating but she doesn't want to... My sister thinks she wants to party and sleep around with no consequences. 

I don't know what I want to do... The only reason I was going to school was for her... The only reason I really had to better myself was for her and now it's all gone... I've been crying all day and my anxiety is back. I'm scared and I just want her to love me again... I put a rose on her car windshield and she was not very happy... She said that's not what friends do

12555,Dating,3azjtu,"Okay, so I'm in love with my best friend.

My aforementioned friend is in high school, same as me, but I never saw her my freshman year due to her homeschooling. We went to the same school, from kindergarten through 1st grade, but I moved a lot, so we never saw each other again until last year.

I started dating this girl, and unbeknownst to me, they were really close friends. I never really paid any mind to it, and I met her at my ex's house party. God, she was beautiful. She was dating one of my ex's friends, and we talked for a bit and caught up, for the most part. My relationship ended the next day, promptly after she told me that she didn't love me. That sucked, and it really hurt when she told me that she was having copious amounts of sex with her guy friends.

Now, while I was going through a seriously fucked up time, so was my friend. She had broken up with her boyfriend, and we started talking, again. We got really close, and caught on pretty fast. I started to develop feelings for her, but I never really told her. That lasted for a while, until my ex decided to take the initiative and spread lies about me to my friend. She didn't like us being friends. I cried... 
A lot.

Fast forward a few months, we haven't made any contact, whatsoever. I'm doing my thing, going to school, blah blah blah.

Then I hear that she might be going to school, this year, and I decide to make sure that we aren't enemies. I wasn't asking to be friends, but I just wanted to be cool with her.

She told me that she wasn't friends with my ex, anymore, and she regretted taking her side without talking to me about it. She told me how she's been thinking about talking to me, again, but didn't want to make me upset.

Boom, we become best friends. She's the only person I can really talk to, and vice-versa. She was talking to guys, I was talking to girls, and it was an all-around good time.

Then my feelings for her came back, way stronger than before. This isn't just a crush, anymore. I know her on such a personal level, and I'm attracted to every aspect of her. I decided to let them spill, and ask her out. 

She says yes, but then informs me that she has a lot of attention from guys, and since we don't see eachother that often, she wants to see how things play out for her before getting into a relationship. I understand, for the most part, and I back off.

She just ended it with this real cuntbag, and she knows how much I like her, but she says that she needs to concentrate on herself for a bit. Don't get me wrong, I get it, but I'm still so in love with her. I just feel like I've been waiting in line, and I hate that. I don't want to guilt her, or force her to like me, but I can't help but feel so strongly towards her. 

I just want to know where to go from here. 
I can't help but want her so much, and I would appreciate some tips.

12556,Infidelity,33yn8g,"The past 24 hours have been a mess for me. Last night, my roommate, his girlfriend and I went to a party for our friends' birthdays. All of us got really drunk and ended up sitting on the bed together and talking about college and stuff. Whenever my roommate looked away, girlfriend would rub my crotch and whisper sexual shit in my ear. I figured she's just drunk, whatever. She probably didn't mean it.

Well, walking back home, she kept doing it. She did it multiple times and kept saying she was horny and stuff, but I just tried to play it cool since my roommate was right there with us. I admittedly reciprocated, but that was the alcohol acting out there. When we got back home, she suggested a threesome, which my roommate immediately rejected. They ended up going to her room and I passed out in mine. 

I woke up around 4:15 to go to the bathroom and check my phone and I saw she had snapchatted me 8 times. I opened them up, and every single one was her naked, asking for pictures of me as well. Again, just figured she was drunk. Whatever. 

This morning she was texting me and asked if I remembered anything, to which I replied that I remembered all of it. She ended up saying that she wanted to have sex with me and proceeded to snap me more naked pictures of herself. 

We all went out to breakfast, and on the way there she said we should hang out together alone while my roommate is at work. 

I texted her after we left breakfast, and basically she admitted that she wanted to cheat on her boyfriend. She's gained weight since coming to college, and admitted her self-esteem is in the toilet and her self-image is shattered. She thinks her boyfriend has lost interest, and she thinks they feel distant, especially so the past few months. She eventually broke down and said cheating won't fix anything, and doesn't know what to do. I told her to come over when roommate/boyfriend is at work so I can talk her through all of this. 

What do you think I should do? I don't plan on having sex or anything with her. She's a great friend, and I'd be ruining their relationship, and the relationship I have with the two of them. Plus, my roommate is my best friend here, so that'd just fuck things up for me too. I think I have an idea of what to say, but some extra help would be awesome. 

Tl;dr - Roommate's girlfriend admitted she and him are having relationship problems, and she wanted to resolve them by cheating on him with me. Talked her out of cheating, but we are still getting together to talk about everything.

12559,Breakups,2c9h5t,"My currently Ex girlfriend and I shared a relationship for close to 10 years, the first 3 where long distance as she is from Germany and went back home after college. She was able to move to the US 6 years ago and I moved to the city she got a job in as it was only fair. We then got moved a second time and to eliminate any need for a visa we got married. For all purposes of the relationship we where married except in the eyes of our friends and family as we did not want to be judged as been married young. We bought and last year sold our home and we could not decide where to move to, I let her explore a state for three months where she could try to find a job where I knew it would not work out.

As time progressed I realized that her intentions to stay where for much longer so I broke up with her. She however wanted to stay in touch and as friends something I was not very pleased with but I still wanted to work things out with her. We had short relationships with other people and I felt like it was a good idea to give it a second chance even if was going to be long distance for a brief period of time. She wanted to give it a try as well.

We went to a couples therapist and we where advised that she is not connected to her emotional side and thats why she does not want to let me go. But wont fully want to continue a relationship that at this point means we would be looking at marriage. On a second session the therapist told me I need to look at the evidence and break up with her. I resisted for a bit but with more time, I saw her not trying hard enough to connect with me as I was. 

I decided to stop contact with her, I think I have tried everything, she did not want to end things but I just did not feel anything coming from her side. Should I keep trying or is it better to part ways?

One thing we both agree on, is that we are perfect for each other in the long term, we have the same hopes and dreams for the future, yet somehow right now she is busy with other things.

12560,Relationships,2p6m8g,"Hi, I would really really appreciate some advice on this. If you read on you'll understand a little bit why I don't really have anyone to go to to talk about this with because of the nature of the secret she let out. 

So I'll get it right out of the way: one of my fetishes is to watch my girlfriend sleep with other men. We have done it twice, once was a threesome and the other time we found a guy online and she slept with him. It has been a weird, strange, exciting, and transforming experience for me. Testing all of my limits. But all in all it has been a HELL of a lot of fun and I've discovered a lot about myself. 

So on to the past couple days. 

My girlfriend and I had agreed to keep this a secret in the beginning, however, things happen and we had discussed it together and ended up sharing (not the details) but the fact that we had dabbled in swinging a little bit and that these things had happened. I opened up to one of my most trusted friends (who is a mutual friend) and she did the same (mutual as well). Now, she had expressed that she wanted to tell the girls about this as well (also mutual friends, we all hangout in the same circle). I was NOT ok with this. I thought enough people had found out already and I really, really, didn't want it getting around that I liked to watch my girlfriend with other men.

So, and I'm really sorry this requires so much background but it's really important, my girlfriend's also been on this new medication for the past couple months that has lowered her alcohol tolerance quite a bit. We found this out because we would go out and she would do inexplicable things, black out, pass out, and act kind of mean towards me. So we discussed it, and she completely agreed that she needed to watch her alcohol intake from here on out because drinking like she used to was causing her to act out when she was too drunk.

And finally we get to the issue.

She went to hangout with her girlfriends two nights ago and she bought a huge bottle of liquor and they all proceeded to get absolutely smashed. At some point in the night she disclosed everything, not the gory details, but enough that I am totally uncomfortable with what she did. So she came home, told me about it, obviously I was pissed and I remained that way all day. I had been planning on going out with some friends whereas she was already really hung over from the night before. As soon as I said I was going out she asked if she could come with me... obviously I said I needed some space. 

Her decision was to go to the party I was probably going to where all of her girlfriends (again, mutual friends) would be.

I'm totally perplexed at her decision to do this (you know, she got too drunk, again, and really fucked up, but decides to go get drunk the very next night anyway). It put me in a really uncomfortable place where I didn't really want to go to the party anymore because she had all the sudden decided to go, and I also felt really uncomfortable around her friends because of the nature of the secrets she exposed. So I ended up going, it was alright, although I hardly acknowledged her the entire night, and I left and told her I was spending the night at my friends. I get home this morning, and she's no where to be found, and she knows I cant stand it because I get worried when she doesn't let me know if she's not going to be home.

I have no idea how to approach all of this. I'm totally shocked at her behavior. I'm also leaving the city to go home for two weeks in 3 days so I don't know how to resolve this in the next couple days.

He had moved in with friends, and then that blew up. He moved back to his Dad's, and that seems to be going well. It's cramped there ( 4 other siblings 3 bed room house ). He also recently got a part time job, I'd like to say 3 months ago? Sounds about right. 

We used to talk a lot, about practically anything. He would send cute messages and say really sweet things. He would also cook for me ( as I would for him too ) and I really appreciated it. We would lay in bed to rest and listen to music, we would just lay there together. It was so relaxing, He was PERFECT. I love him to the moon and back, and I miss this everyday. 

Now, I hardly hear from him. Texting almost seems pointless... it takes forever to hear back from him. He doesn't call much, and on his days off he will come over... but he either plays his video games or sleeps. I feel really alone in this all. I really miss HIM. To be honest, I've gotten really jealous these last few months too. I went from ALWAYS being around him to seeing him every few days. I wish I was one of the girls he worked with... 

anyway, I feel like we're loosing each other.  Maybe he has grown out of me and doesn't have it in himself just to leave me. :'( Oh I'm feeling low.

I've tried spicing things up... I send him cute texts, in return I get short responses. I've called, but it usually goes to voicemail and he texts me 10 mins later ( FUCKING VIDEO GAMES ! ), I've left cute notes and he doesn't show much response. It really hurts to think things may be over.


We haven't had much alone time lately though, but tomorrow after work (9pm) he is supposed to come and stay for the next few days (wed-sat). It'll just be us so hopefully we can spend some time together and get back on track. I plan on making him a nice warm dinner &amp; desert. I just want to make him happy, and  hopefully light his flame with me again. 

He hasn't said he didn't love me anymore, or that he wanted to leave. I can just feel that something isn't right. I've been crying/angry for the last week because of it.

And before anyone says anything -- I know it's his money. But his actions have set off some warning bells.

We live together. Neither of us works, but my main thing every day is looking, obviously. I do what I can to bring in what I can. I've been living off what I saved up before I moved out of state to be here, with him. We both share costs of most things.

Main characters: Jordan aka yours truly, my really good buddy Matt who broke the news, Stacy my girlfriend, and Ben the guy who kissed her, I've known him for four years. 

Been dating Stacy for around 5 months, closer to 4 at the time it happened. She knows that both of the TWO girlfriends I have had in my life both cheated on me, which I told her very tearfully one night.

So, hanging out with my friends tonight, they said they had something important to tell me. My friend Matt is the one who broke it to me. At a mutual friends birthday house party in the middle of August, I invited my friend Ben to the party cause he knew some of the people. There was quite some time where my girlfriend Stacy and Ben were hanging out, including one-on-one. I was getting upset cause she really didn't pay attention to where I was/how i was doing, even though I was checking up on her and wanting to hang out, but she didn't concern herself with me (not the first or last time that happened either). I felt (well, feel) completely ignored a lot with her. This isn't the first time the ignoring has happened either at a party/bar, but it's usually resolved at the end of the night.

What Matt told me is at some point at this party in August, Stacy came up to him crying, saying that when they were together, Ben kissed her. She bailed after the kiss to tell Matt, but I still didn't see much of her the rest of the night. I ended up cabbing home with her, Ben, and another friend (as other friend and Ben were crashing at my house), and dropped the two of them off there and headed to her place to sleep. Keep in mind that all we know about the 'kiss' was what Stacy told us. I don't know it at all from Ben's perspective, whether it was just him kissing her, or if it was potentially mutual. I'm considering asking him to fess up and tell me what happened that night. (If Ben is completely honest and tells me it was just him giving her a kiss to which she immediately bailed, and that's what ACTUALLY happened, I'll really appreciate it).

So a couple days later Good Guy Matt tells Stacy she HAS to tell me. Stacy told my friend it's not a big deal, that it wasn't important for Jordan to know, and that she didn't want to ruin the friendship between  Jordan and Ben. He brought it up to her again a couple weeks later, same excuses. We got in a fight on Saturday (more on that in a bit), and Matt thought that this *might* have been involved, and gave Stacy an ultimatum: tell Jordan about it tonight or he will. She doesn't, claiming the same excuses, and now we are here as he tells me tonight.

My main concern is how to address it to her. I want to do it ASAP, we got into a bit of a fight Saturday so we are already a bit rocky. Since the fight was over such petty shit, I knew that there's something else on her mind. Was this it, or is there more?

Please, more suggestions other than break up with her. I'm at a very alone point in my life and don't want to lose her. I need to have a mature conversation with her, and that's one i'm planning on having Wednesday or Thursday.

PS: Matt, you're never gonna see this, but thank you so much man. Whether Stacy and I work this out together and emerge better because of it, or whether she takes no sympathy and we break up, I'll be better off because of it.

About four month in the relationship his dog died, and some time after this his family found out that his mom was cheating and his parents got a divorce. His mom got back to their country (they came here about 10 years ago) and has been there since. He has gone a couple of times to see her and talks to her weekly, but he doesn't talk to me a lot about his parents.


After all of that, he got every time more sad and depressed. I have been supporting him completely, but I don't think I can keep going forever. I have been trying to remember that things will get better and that now I have to be strong, but after going to therapy three times he stopped going because he said it was useless and that he didn't like it. If therapy is useless, and he does nothing else to get out of this situation, how is it going to change? 


His dad is really sad too and it's not really helpful, and I his sister worries about him but it looks like it's not doing much neither. He has let go almost all his friends (he never go out or meet them anymore) so I'm the only thing he has now to keep going and to cheer him up. That means I'm not allowed to have emotions: if I get sad, or mad, or I'm just in a bad mood because I had a shitty day he will get really sad or get mad too. I can't discuss the bad things of our relationship because this will mean hours of crying and me trying to cheer him up. I try to be always OK and happy, and if I have to cry I hide it (we live together) but not seeing an end to this is overwhelming me.


Reedit, what can I do? This is affecting my college results (I didn't pass a single exam this year, and I really NEED to pass to keep studyingand finish college), I feel like I need to carry myself and him with any other help and it's more than I can do. I have thought (selfishly...) about leaving but I couldn't let him alone and without me I'm afraid what he could do. The last time we had a big argument he said he was gonna kill himself :( and I wasn't even thinking about breaking up, we just got really mad.

We fight over miscommunication mainly, as he says some things to me that are meant to be taken lightly, but I take them seriously due to the way he says them. 


These arguments get drawn out and when I try to explain why I am upset with what he has said, he says that I take things too seriously and need to lighten up. It is something I am working on, to say the least.



I am big on respect. If I say something that offends you, I will apologize for offending you out of respect for you. Don't take that as being a doormat, though. I think an apology shows respect for the other person, not so much admitting defeat. I was taught this as a child.



My boyfriend thinks I'm sorry are just words. I assume that is the way he was brought up. I understand that they are just words if there is no feelings attached to them, and I guess that's what I'm mainly concerned about this time around.



My main issue is that recently he called me a fucking bitch and refuses to apologize because it's true and that I was acting like one. Fair enough, but I told him how disrespectful it was and that I was insulted, and he told me that he would give me a lip service apology and not mean it because I just need to hear the words.



Unfortunately, disrespect like this turns into resentment for me and I do not want to resent him. I want to move past this but I feel disrespected. I can't make him feel remorseful or apologetic, and I'm starting to question if I can even be with someone who shows so much disrespect in heat of the moment fights and later refuses to reassess his behavior.

12572,Relationships,2k81of,"First post.  I live in Miami Beach; I met a girl from Austria here and we spent the whole summer together until her ESTA ran out.  Fast forward to mid-August:  She's back in Austria and has found a new job right away.  Unfortunately, although she was excited for the job initially, after just one day she realized she completely hates it.  Now, it has been two weeks and she says her coworkers are treating her poorly and her bosses have even asked her to work overtime twice without pay.  She wakes up at 7am each day to catch a train to Vienna, and stays at work until 6pm, then takes a train back home and finds no time for herself.  Needless to say, she has already begun searching for another job.

Since she's gotten this job, she has not been herself, completely down and exhausted every single day.  (She is normally bright, energetic, and lighthearted.)  I wish I could do something, and it's hopelessly saddening and frustrating to know I am so powerless and ineffectual.  I cannot even encourage her positively with my words because she so unhappy with her life that others annoy her these days because all she really wants is some time to herself.  And, not for nothing, her time is six hours ahead of mine, so this in conjunction with her work schedule, makes for less Skyping opportunities.

Still we have the ability to simply text one another to show our love.  Sadly, however, she is not responding with the love and energy she once showed.  Usually, she will respond 6-9 hours later merely telling me she is so exhausted, although sometimes she is not responding at all.  This is far from how we interacted in her first month back, when we used to respond to each other's loving texts without much delay, with gratuitous use of hearts and smileys, and we would never go a day allowing the other to believe we were not on each other's minds all day long.  We would enjoy our differential time-zones by texting each other guten-Morgen's and goodnight's.

Problem:  Now, I behave towards her as I always have, by her continuing request to tell her what I do in my day and sending her loving texts and photos.  I am worried that perhaps I should text her less frequently, although I have never been good at pacing myself methodically in this regard.  Obviously, I know it's possible to smother someone who is going through anxiety and stress and I want to avoid that, but I really fear a withdrawal would put distance between us and hurt the relationship, which would seriously sadden me.

Before she left to go back, we agreed to pursue this relationship in a wholehearted and headstrong fashion.  Not really knowing what a long-distance relationship of this magnitude entails, we decided to follow our hearts and, frankly, our goal is real love, commitment, and eventual marriage.  (I know it's crazy, but we love each other.)  She has been back in Austria for 1 month and 11 days now, and we have still about 2 more months to go before I have enough money so I can quit my job and go see her in Austria for a few months with a Visa Waiver of my own.  When I'm there, I sure all will be alright and we can plan further for our future then.

Lastly:  We finally conversed about the texting issue at the start of this week, and she says it is not her intention to put distance between us and that this is only her problem.  I assured her I do not want to be another annoying person in her life, that I am not like other guys and have committed myself to loving her and encouraging her peacefulness and happiness.  I warned her of putting distance in our relationship, though, but told her if she could only assure me that is not the case, I would make a greater effort towards being more patient and less sensitive.  I told her that I don't need much at all, advising her to merely send me a drop of love each day with hearts or kisses via text as that is almost no effort for her and it would settle my heart's contention.  She agreed to try to display more signs of love, but now 4 days have passed and I still feel the issue is the same.

I wish I was on her mind these days as much as she is on mine.  See, if I were, and all she had time for was to send me a happy face, I would not feel so worried about this.  I love this girl so much and can't wait to see her in December.  Please share your experiences and encouragement and give me some comfort and advice, Reddit.

A few weeks ago this girl from work told me she had a huge crush on me, which was pretty awesome since I've had a thing for her for the last few months. I never bothered with her though because she had a boyfriend at the time (They were together for about a year and a half). I later found out (a bit before she confessed to me) that he was emotionally and physically abusive and that she left him because she grew tired of him.

After she told me that we began talking and texting each other daily. Everything was fine but then she eventually stopped replying to my texts. When I would see her at work she would be super apologetic about not replying and she would tell me that she would try to text me later that night, she almost never did though.

So I decide to try to hang out with her at work a bit more often. We would take lunch and breaks together when ever we could. It wasn't just me making the effort to try to hang out either, she would ask her supervisors if she could take her breaks or lunch at the same time as mine. During work she would tell me all this nice stuff like how I would make her blush, how she would get nervous around me, how she had dreams of me, etc.

It felt like everything was going great until one of my co-workers told me that her ex was still in her life. That made me wonder if the reason that she never replied to my texts was because she was still seeing him. So I decide to take her out to eat after work and talk about it.

During our lunch she told me that they live together, that he's currently unemployed so he spends the majority of his time at their home (which is actually her parents house) and that she doesn't reply to my texts in order to protect me from him (we kinda know each other). She told me that they weren't together any more but he refuses to leave. I asked her about getting restraining order but she immediately dismissed the idea. We spent the rest of the lunch just flirting and talking about other stuff. However, since then she's been acting completely different. The following day I asked her to lunch and she stood me up. Since then she doesn't seem happy to see me any more, she just says hey and walks away.


I have no idea what to do, should I just back off and let her deal with her own stuff or should I try to talk to her about what's going on between me and her or her and her ex? I've been wanting to take her out to lunch again but I don't want to seem needy or obsessed or anything like that. Plus I don't want to get stood up again.

When my partner isn't around, I feel so much stronger as a person. I know what I want to do with myself, more in touch with my interests and passions. 

I don't know why this is happening. I thought long and hard about it, fearing that I missing out on some psychological or emotional abuse. But this is a man that will spend time with me even when I'm doing things that bore him to tears. He has no patience for cooking, but will help me out in the kitchen. He prefers league of legends, I like mario kart. He'll still play with me. He isn't close to his family, but he goes out of his way to build a relationship with my siblings and parents. He respects and adores them. We have our own book club where I get to choose the books. 

I think I might be intimidated by him, truthfully. He's very opinionated and has something to contribute on everything. He's one of those men that is just so well read and intelligent that they know a bit of everything and can thoughtfully contribute to conversations. He's an intellectual challenge at times and can be blunt. I get easily intimidated by his intellect. 

He pokes a lot of fun at me, though. Most of the time it's in good fun, and I find it hilarious in an endearing way. Sometimes he'll hit a sore spot, and I'll tell him, and he won't do it again. Ever. 

So he's amazing.

So some background: I've been seeing a guy for almost 2 months now. We met online and really hit off during our first date and, for me at least, feelings have been developing pretty quickly. He's literally everything I've been looking for in a guy and then some, and I really see potential for a future. Unfortunately he had to leave for the summer (only about 2 hours away) a few weeks after our first date until the end of the summer, and because of our conflicting schedules we were only able to see each other once this summer and it looks like we won't be able to see each other again until he comes back.

When we did see each other we were together for 5 full days and things were amazing. The first night we were together we were drinking and at one point I (pretty drunk) started crying and admitted that I liked him more than I usually like guys at this point and wanted something serious. I asked him if he liked me and he said yes and I said I know he was afraid of making long term plans because of the failure of his previous relationship (something we had talked about before) but that I liked him a lot and was willing to help him work through that. Things get foggy here, but at one point he started crying and we just held each other until we fell asleep. The rest of our time together was amazing and not awkward at all. The last night we were together we were drinking again and both ended up saying we loved each other, but it was during some roleplay during sex, so I'm not sure how much I should read into that.

Ever since we came back from being together, he's seemed a little distant (though I have an anxiety disorder and it's flared up for unrelated reasons and really think this could be coloring my perception) and when comparing schedules we realized we won't be able to see each other for another month, when he moves back here for fall semester. I'm really upset about it and while I know he isn't the sort to show emotion up front like that I find myself wishing he would express that he's upset more than he has. 

Like I've said before, I'm looking for something serious with him and have been upfront about this, but we both decided it didn't make sense to commit to each other before he left from the summer when we had only been hanging out a few weeks and wouldn't be with each other. The only thing is, I'm not sure *when* I should talk to him about becoming official and monogamous. I was thinking around my birthday, which would be a month after he gets back. Does that seem too soon? I forgot to mention he's graduating at the end of next semester, which is another reason he's expressed some hesitancy at getting to serious too quickly, but my reasoning is that if by December we've made it through a summer of distance and a few months together, we could just cross that bridge when we get to it. 

The problem is, I'm not sure exactly how to have this conversation and if my plan on when to have it is a good idea or not. Thanks in advance for you advice!

Anyway, last night she texted me that she doesn't think it will work out because I'm not there. That is literally the only thing, she would rather have somebody there who she can touch rather than continue a loving, long relationship that has potential. I'm trying to talk to her and she is telling me that although she loves me, she doesn't romantically love me as much anymore because of the distance. I've done everything right that I can control in a LDR, but the one thing I can't control backfires on me and blows everything up.

For most people this wouldn't be a huge deal, but she was my first everything. Before her, I was a scrawny, acne ridden kid who would rarely go out and be social. She is more of a socialite and we met in a class my junior year. She changed me so much. I'm much more outgoing now and being able to talk to her has kept my morals high at a college where I'm not social (not b/c I haven't tried, it just isn't safe because of crime). 

I want to transfer and continue our relationship, but everybody I've talked to says that isn't a solution. I'm afraid of relapsing back into the person I used to be, which scares me so much.

She changed everything for me, and losing that catalyst has me so scared for myself.

Is there any way to prove he has been sending pictures? I guess that is the thing about snapchat – you don’t know what people have been sending. I have now convinced myself he has been cheating but maybe I am just thinking the worst. I don’t know. I need advice.

12583,Relationships,23iic3,"Ok, just a little backstory.


For around 18 months I have been on a diet. I have lost around 120 lbs and I still have about 50lbs to go. This is going to be relevant later.


I don't really go around advertising what I've done. I think one of the reasons I've been successful with this diet so far is that I am doing for no one else but me. Again, relevant later.


I met this girl and we've been sort of going out, hence the quotes in the title. I haven't been with anyone else and I think she hasn't either, but I wouldn't call it official.


One night we were in bed and she asked me about my loose skin. I'm 1,75m tall (5'9''ish) 90kg (198lbs). I am overweight, but I seem a lot fatter than normal because of all the loose skin, so I guess she was curious. So I told her the whole story of how I've been on this diet, how it's still ongoing, etc, and she was really happy for me, congratulated me, all the good stuff you'd expect from someone that likes you.


But then, I showed her my before picture. And when she saw it, her immediate reaction was to put on a eww face and said, in the most natural of ways, ooh my god, you were so disgusting!.


This was a couple of weeks ago, and when she said it, it bothered me, but I didn't say anything. Every day it keeps bothering me more and more. Sure, I had a problem. I ate like a pig. I'm fixing it. But to call me disgusting, it just showed me a side of her that I honestly did not want to see.


In her defense, I am still overweight. I still have about 50lbs to go. I have a bit of loose skin so I definitely don't look good naked, and that doesn't seem to bother her, which is why I find it odd that her natural reaction was to call me disgusting.


Our relationship so far is as great as a one month relationship can be. We have fun together, sex is great, we get along well and we have very good chemistry, all the good things you'd expect for the beginning of a relationship that is going in the right direction.


Even with all this good stuff, I just can't get that comment out of my head and I keep thinking of breaking this off. And I honestly don't know why. The good outweighs the bad so much and it still bothers me.


Honestly, I need opinions. Am I overreacting? Am I just searching for a way out? Or am I right and she really is a bad person and I should get rid of her.

Thanks for reading.

This was a few weeks ago now. We took some space at first. Then we met up a couple of times and just started to meet up more and more. We've been hanging out every few days. He usually gets in touch most days. We've slept together a couple of times, although when we're together he's rarely affectionate. It's like having a friend with occasional benefits except there's a history. Basically, I guess he wants to see how things go. But to me, I feel like I'm stuck in a limbo waiting around for him. I'm so unhappy.

A couple of days ago I got very drunk and a male friend brought me home. We ended up making out. It was awkward - very much instigated by him, but I wasn't in a state to really say no, and I feel a bit taken advantage of. It made me realize that I do miss the affection though. I do want to get back together with my ex. I love him and want to make things work, but I just don't know how long I'll be waiting for. I can't wait forever in this situation, it's killing me inside. I guess because I can't move on, but at the same time we're not moving forwards. Also I'm now really conflicted because I feel like I've betrayed my ex - but is there anything there to betray? I just don't know.

We have gone out once and hit it off but we both are really busy with our professions and for a while it seemed like she wasn't really interested. I would ask her to come out with me on various outings, mostly casual, but I would always get a polite excuse. Not a big deal since I understand our line of work keeps us busy most of the time. 

So yesterday she invites me to go out to a bar with some friends. They pick me up, we go out and everyone had a good time. At the end of the night we all go get some food, I just stick to coffee since I wanted to sober up, then they drop me off at home. 

I get a call from her moments later saying she wants to see me so I go over and we talk in my car for a bit. One thing leads to another and our make out sesh turns into foreplay. 

Now this is where things get weird. So we get down to it and I can't seem to keep an erection. It's good for a while but then my 1up just doesn't want to cooperate. So we finish and there's the awkward goodbye, see ya later.

I try to apologize but that doesn't seem to get me anywhere, she mentions not telling anyone and that's the last I hear from her. Needless to say I'm feeling rather shitty about it.

Then he said he likes to live his own life and choose when and how he allows others to participate and he needs his comfort zone.  He also told me his ex was not affectionate and he is used to being the affectionate one in the relationship.  He also doesn't like gifts and whenever I do small things for him he tells me he didn't really appreciate it.  He has given me a short list of things I can do to show my affection.  He also doesn't like for me to go out of my way to do things for him sexually - he says he can do better himself but that he gets off from pleasing me.

I am a little disappointed because I'm coming out of a 15 year relationship that was horrible and I really looked forward to finding someone I could enjoy doing things for.  I want to pamper someone a little - I'm not overly warm and affectionate.  But I'd like to be able to rub their feet after a long day or buy something they might like at a store or try something new that they might like when we have sex without having to hear about their comfort zone.  I don't really want to have to stick to a list.  I don't mind feedback so I can do things better but a list is so limiting.  

I think this is going to be a deal breaker for me but I was interested in getting some other opinions.  I sort of feel like he just wants whatever he had with his ex even though she treated him really badly and that he wants me to treat him like his ex did.  Is this what dating is like in your 30s?

12588,Breakups,2tkw60,"So tonight me [23 M] and my Girlfriend [22 F] ended our three year relationship. We met at university and instantly fell for each other, she was the greatest person I'd ever met, every argument we had we always laughed it off, things were great for about 2 years. After we graduated from university she moved to where I'm from (a 5 hour drive from where she is from), it was a hard time for me because my grandfather had been diagnosed with lung cancer, so the pressure of looking for a house and worrying about him made it hard for the both of us, a day after we moved into our new house he passed away, resulting in months of me being upset. I got put on antidepressants because losing my grandad was such a massive blow for me and my family, we were extremely close. Things seemed to pick up from there, we seemed fine, and I was getting better. She was there for me. But I always had a feeling it got her down too, which made me reluctant to talk to her about my personal feelings. I since then got better, though the depression and my new job in an office led me to gain weight, which completely destroyed my confidence. 
.   this is where things went wrong. September of 2014 things seemed ok, I was starting my Masters again in university, though I have to travel 2 hours to get there. Money had always been tight but I don't think it resulted in us breaking up, I think it did put strain on it though. 
Out of the blue she told me she doesn't feel the same about me anymore, I was so upset but we agreed to try and work it out. 
.  So since then she's been nit picking at me, telling me she's nit attracted to me anymore because of my weight gain and that Im lazy (even though I go to university full time and work a part time job), I said aid try harder; I started working out and I have been trying so hard to get fit (which she said she sees that I've been doing well). 
.  Despite this she's still been quite nasty with me, I do everything for her, she doesn't drive so I drive her to work every day and pick her up, I buy her a lot of stuff, just because I was dumb enough to think shed like me more. 
.  After Christmas I went to pick her up from her parents home, It took 10 hours in the snow, but when I arrived she was just an ass, that's the best way to describe it, she never asked if ai was ok even though Id driven across the country in snow to get her. She carried on being cold and in the way home I confronted her about it resulting in an argument all the way home. 
.   We broke up that night, I went to sleep at my parents, the nest day I went to our house to get my stuff, but somehow we decided to give it a shot. Plus we have a puppy and it killed me leaving him too. 
.   She said she loved me but she's not attracted to me anymore, though she always says Im good looking. (this shattered my confidence. I've never been confident in myself anyway but this really hurt).
.    Anyway I though that if I made a massive effort to try and make her happy again.
.    We argued again and said we'd give it a month and go from there, I foolishly spent all my money on bills agreeing that shed pay for next months bills. 
. And we come to today, I'd spent the day cleaning the house and doing university work, when I went to get her she had a massive go at me for not having dinner ready (I'd planned to cook it after getting home) because its and hours drive. I confronted her about her attitude, shed been really callus for some time, barely making an effort. She always says she's trying to make it work, but honestly her attitude just pushed me away. I'd gotten sick of it. 
.   I said last night after shed yet again unloaded on me, so I was really upset that despite all my efforts (one night I'd prepared a rose petal path upstairs to the bath for her with red wine ready for her.) she still treated me like shit. 
.   I told her I cant carry on like this and agreed to break up, she says its unfair on me that she treats me like this, yet she doesn't know why she does it (I don't get that at all to be honest). 

And here's the help I need.. So I wont be talking to her ever again, I find it easier to just erase and ex from my life completely, delete all memories and photos. (I find this is the best way). 

I want to know how can I move on, I'm not upset now, I'm kind if relieved, seeing the future. But I know there will be days and night where my demons will creep on me, days where I'll miss the days gone past, and the massive what if for the rest of my life. She's the first girl ai committed myself to 100%, planned to get engaged this year too. 
.  I have a lot of stress at university too, I have a massive deadline in the coming weeks so I need to get my head sorted asap and just be ok.
.  Moving back in with my parents will suck, because I like my privacy (I've never been on facebook). 

So I just need some advice, what do now? I don't want the generic google answers, I've read the whole generic 'youll be ok crap'. I want real answers from genuine people.

I was hoping you could help me with a situation I am in. I [M26] am at a point in my 2 year relationship with my girlfriend [F26] where I need to decide whether to continue on or end it now. 

Here is an explanation of why I have to make this decision. My girlfriend, let's call her Lacey, has an 8-year old daughter and lives with her retired &amp; divorced father. Lacey's ex-boyfriend still visits their daughter but lives far away and has a new family. I live on my own in a 2 bdr condo I rent. In 6 months, Lacey and her father will have to decide whether or not to renew the lease on the house they rent together. It only makes sense that at that point Lacey and her daughter would move in with me and her father would be free to move wherever he likes (he has mentioned he would like to move to a location 2 1/2 hours away). Lacey is in school full time and works part time, but wouldn't be able to afford living on her own with her daughter until she finishes school, which probably won't be for another year. The reason I need your help is because I am not sure whether I am ready for this next step for two reasons. I am not sure whether Lacey is the girl for me and I am pretty sure that I don't want children. I need to decide soon because if I chose to stay with her and continue this relationship her father can begin making arrangements to move to wherever he likes. If I choose to end this relationship then they would most likely choose to continue the lease and live together. 

Do I stay, taking a chance on the relationship, knowing I would have to be in it at least for another year until she could move out? Or is it better to end it now and give Lacey a chance to find someone new, who might be a better fit with her child? Any advice would be helpful.

I came back after I got out of line and asked her for her number and she obliged and we started texting a few days ago. We asked a few light questions about each other and exchanged some face pictures so we wouldn't forget what the other looked like.


We have spoke briefly each day but haven't really gotten to known each other that well (nothing too personal about each other or anything too serious, just friendly conversation).

However, I am confused because a couple of nights ago and a recent morning, she sent me some especially attractive photos.


I made it unfortunately awkward by asking why I got such pictures and she just apologized and said she meant nothing by it and that she was just comfortable in her own skin.

On one hand, I am hurt that someone who seems to love me so much is not stepping up in this department, while on the other hand, I haven't explicitly requested that he pay a little more often. So a few questions for you: Is it fair of me to ask that he pay a little more than half the time? If so, should I be disappointed that he hasn't already insisted on stepping up his game?

12600,Infidelity,1zgrnk,"My girlfriend and I have been dating since November 7th, 2013.  She is going to Ireland in September for a wedding (we live in the US).  She went to graduate school in Ireland and while over there, she fell in love with a guy.  They had a very passionate physical and emotional relationship, but he doesn't believe in monogamy and plans on living his life in open relationships with women.  My girlfriend was crushed because he wouldn't commit to her.  They have stayed friends and she calls him her best friend.  

Before we started dating, she asked him to go with her to the wedding as her date.  I asked her if we are still dating, if I could be her date instead of him.  She then proceeded to tell me that he's already asked for time off from his job in Africa for that time period and that the wedding is going to be a reunion of old friends with a bunch of inside jokes I won't understand.

To make a long story short, I feel that between being back in Ireland with all her friends, getting drunk, and being with this guy, she is going to cheat on me.

What advice do you have?  How can I bring this up without seeming as insecure as I feel?  I'm open to suggestions.

12603,Infidelity,3fuamw,"withing the past few days, i had received information from an old friend, that my current GF had cheated on me with another much older friend a few months ago.l This information was, shaky, at best, but irregardless I took seriously and wanted to do a little digging. Well last night, while my S/O was sleeping, i went through her text messages and found some mildly incriminating information. There were no blatant discussions about previous events, nor any talk of betrayal or hatred of me. there was however quite a few i love you messages here and there for the past few weeks. I regret now not being able to check the dates and to see how far back it went, but considering how much she texts others, it couldn't have been more than a month (while the event as told to me happened much earlier this year) I have made absolutely no moves, no hints, no nothing. last time something like this happened i flew off the handle (Words were said, absolutely no striking or hitting of absolutely any kind) and this time i want a much more calm and collected approach. He will be coming back from the military in a few weeks and will be staying for a month, that's when i will be doing most of my sleuthing and digging. Again, as slow as i can take it, for i have no true concrete evidence so i don't want this blowing up in my face. She has exhibited none of the signs of cheating that many will show, as a person she hasn't changed much recently, nor had she started any changes if she indeed had been physical back in the past. I hope this is coherent, and i hope i catch all spelling and grammar errors before i submit. i'm currently shaking with rage ATM because i no longer have to keep up a facade since i'm at work (US security guard post). Any help comments or advice greatly appreciated, i will be on for the next 7 hours.

I am going to do little things, ask innocuous probing questions here and there, if i safely can in going to look at her phone again.

12604,Dating,3dy2um,"So I met this wonderful gal through a mutual friend and we enjoyed each other's company on a night where we hung out with our mutual friend. On that night, we were about to part ways and it turned out we parked close to each other. So I walked her to her car and stopped and chatted which then led to her inviting me to a show the following night and asking for my number. She called my phone right then and I added her as a contact. 
The following night I asked her where we should meet at. She replied that she wasn't sure if she was going. I was cool with that.

A few days later I ask her if she would like to go out for lunch and she says yes. So we tell each other what our schedules look like and she asks if a Saturday would work and I said yes. So Saturday comes and about an hour before our scheduled time she says she is yard work that is taking a lot longer than she thought and asked for a rain check. I was bummed out at first, but then I remembered that yard work typically takes a longer than normal so no harm done. 

Another few days pass and I decide to cash in on my rain check before I was to leave out of town for a week. So I ask her what her schedule was like on a Tuesday. She said she had work and had plans with friends afterwards and asked if I wanted to grab some coffee at 8 in the morning before she had to work. So 8 in the morning on Tuesday it was. 

Tuesday came and I found myself waiting outside of the cafè, half an hour after we had planned to meet up and then I receive a text from her saying that she has no time to eat because she got up late, and she is not a morning person. Then she sent another text saying that she felt like a flake, and that she needs to manage her time better, and she'll see me around. 
At that moment I felt weird and drove back home to nap in it and I told her that I understand life gets in the way of plans and told her that she was not a flake.

Two weeks have passed since and I feel strange about it. A part of me saying that I should just try again because she is shy. Another part of me is saying that she is simply not interested.

12605,Relationships,3h9pei,"This a situation I never thought I would find myself in, and it's hard for me to understand why my boyfriend would do this.

I met John about two years ago. We fell in love quickly. I thought that after a while he would introduce me to his family. We passed our one-year anniversary, and still I hadn't met his family. By this point, he'd met most of my friends and family, but I still hadn't met many of his friends and none of his family. 

I finally asked him several months later if he was ever going to introduce me to his parents and siblings, and he told me that he couldn't. He explained that his family did not approve of our relationship because I was too much of a hippie and clashed with their traditional values. In short, they had told him, he said, that I was not welcome in their house. I was devastated by this, but after my boyfriend told me that he had really fought with them over the issue, I fell even more in love with him. I didn't care so much about whether his family liked me as long as I had him. I didn't even care that he still went home to visit them even though they hated me. 

After that I didn't bring the subject up again until I got pregnant last September. Since I was afraid to talk to them, I asked my boyfriend if he would let them know and tell them that I'd really like for us to be able to work things out so that their grandchild could have them in his/her life. My boyfriend told me later that he had told his parents about my pregnancy but they still hadn't changed their minds. I was extremely upset by this and carried it with me through the rest of the pregnancy.

Then, in June, I had our baby son. I kept thinking that at some point they would come visit or send a card or gift or something, but they never did. I finally got so upset at them for ignoring my son that a few weeks ago I found the number of my boyfriend's mother, father, sister, and brother, and sent them all a very angry message.

They all sent me messages saying that they had been told by my boyfriend that I didn't want to met them because, based on what he'd told me, I said they sounded gross. I told them that I had never said anything like that and had been wanting to meet them for the past two years, but my boyfriend told me that they hated me. They also told me that they had no idea that my boyfriend had a child, or that I had even been pregnant, and that they would love to me him ASAP.  

The good news is that his family are coming to see my son soon, and they've been sending so many gifts and supplies. We're now talking directly, and from what I can tell, they seem like lovely people.

As for the bad, I confronted my boyfriend about this after I felt capable of concluding that his family wasn't lying about knowing, and he has now admitted that he lied to all of us about the situation. He told me that he did it because he was afraid that his family would like me more than him after they got to know me. He also said that part of it was due to him being ashamed of how I dressed and fixed my hair in comparison to his brother's wife. 

He's been very apologetic since everything came out, but I am having a hard time getting over the fact that he lied to me for so long, especially when he saw how much it hurt me to know his family didn't want to see our son. He says he wants to work things out, but I don't know if I can trust him.

12606,Dating,31u0m5,"So I’m not even sure where to start with this, and I’m not even sure what questions I’m asking, so bear with me. There is a tl;dr for everyone below, and Tom is not a real name. This is a throwaway account.

Long story short, I like a guy. Tom, why not? Tom and I met at school last Spring, and I quickly befriended him. We got on absurdly well. Tom is ten years older than I am, and he was in a committed relationship when I met him. From the start I knew he loved his partner very much from the way he would talk about her, and this made me happy. Tom and I spent a lot of late nights together in the lab, usually just talking about nothing while working on our separate projects and sharing things with each other. We’d also go out to dinner about once a week and eat together, which was very fun.

I really loved Tom. He quickly became one of my closest friends and confidants, and he helped me through a horrible relationship that I was having with another guy in our same social group. Over summer, we hung out nearly every night after I got done with work, working on a local club project with another friend. We would also spend Friday nights together, staying out late and often ending with me falling asleep over at his house and then waking up late and driving home.

He would teach me how to do practical things, like wire a house or jog pipe, which I really loved, since no one had ever bothered to teach me stuff like that.

Tom was also very affectionate and touchy, but not in a way that was unwelcome or inappropriate. He was very gruff about showing affection, with rough hugs and hair-tousling that were clear ‘you are my friend/younger sibling and I care about you’ gestures. Occasionally I would see his partner and the three of us would hang out. I liked his partner—she seemed really nice, and I thought it was really cool of her that she was okay with me hanging out with Tom so much.

I am not very smart.

After Summer was over and school started up again, I still managed to see Tom a lot, even though I was in school and he no longer was. We would hang out every Tuesday and Thursday night, and I would teach him calculus, something he’d never been too good at.

The nights would usually end with us lounging around on my couch, just talking about nothing, me mostly complaining about how my chances with the boy I’d been having problems with were rapidly reaching a ‘this will never happen and he finds you repulsive’ point. One night, when we were talking, he dropped this on me:
“You’ve been really good for me. Also, me hanging out with you has made *Tom’s partner* so jealous that she actually wants to hang out with me again.”

I took pause at this, mostly disturbed by the fact that his partner had even been jealous of us hanging out. I told him I hadn’t known that she’d had a problem with us hanging out at all, and that he shouldn’t be hanging out with me if it was causing trouble. He insisted that, no, it was a good thing, and we continued to hang out.

About a month later, things had started to get slightly awkward between Tom and I, mostly because I had finally gotten fully rejected by the boy I was supposed to be crushing on and had to face the inappropriate feelings I had developed for Tom. He had gotten awkward too, though I didn’t know why, and he began saying things like ‘If I were single, I’d be trying to date you right now,’ Which is never a good sign for the ‘just friends’ label.

And this is the part where you start rolling your eyes, if you haven’t already done so.

Instead of telling Tom to fuck right off and go back to his partner and that we shouldn’t see each other any more, I told him that, no, he wasn’t single, so he shouldn’t be thinking about that and could we just go back to math please. He did, though he kept putting in awkward comments about ‘how disappointed he would be when I got a boyfriend because he wouldn’t be able to hang out with me anymore’. I kept trying to remind him that he had a partner and that he should probably be hanging out with her, but he told me that she didn’t want to see him, so I decided to keep hanging out with him, because I still loved Tom very much and he was a very dear friend who I loved spending my time with.

Of course, as you know, and I know now, this was a terrible idea. Finally, after a few more late-night awkward-compliment couch conversations, he offered to be my first kiss, something that was important to him and not important to me. I had no idea how to respond to this, since I’d never actually been kissed by anyone or dated anyone, and after the last rejection I’d suffered, I was feeling poorly enough about myself to figure that no one ever would want to kiss or date me. I was relieved and flattered that someone would be willing to *take one for the team and bring himself to kiss me.*

I have a few self-esteem issues.

At this point, Tom had told me that he was very sure that his partner was cheating on him, though I still didn’t feel right about how our relationship had progressed, especially now that I knew that us hanging out and being as close as we were made her angry and jealous. I liked his partner and thought she was a nice person, and that she didn’t deserve to be lied to, no matter what she’d done. I told him that. Also, I thought that Tom shouldn’t be stooping to her level by cheating back and should instead break up with her or work it out. 

Did I tell him that, though? Of course not. Instead, I thought about it for a while, and finally reasoned that this was Tom I was thinking about. He wouldn’t lie to me or try anything weird. If I could kiss anybody and have it just be a platonic pity thing, it would be him. So, a week later, I agreed to kiss him. He kissed me, and it was fine. I thought that would be the end of it, first kiss, done.

I was wrong. I was very, very, wrong. One thing led to another and we were soon having full-blown makeout sessions at my apartment. The guilt about the entire affair was killing me. I couldn’t eat or sleep, and I lost twenty pounds over the course of a month. After the second makeout session, I told Tom that he had to tell his partner what had happened and that he had to own up to what he’d done, and that I couldn’t do this anymore. On a more selfish note, I didn’t want to be Tom’s ‘side chick’, or whatever they called it. I made it very clear to him that I was not that kind of lady, nor was I to be treated as such. He told his partner that he and I had kissed soon after, which is when she admitted that she’d been cheating on him with her friend for the past four months. 

So they decided that they weren’t happy together and decided to break up, right? (A note, All of the stuff that involves Tom and his partner comes from his mouth, meaning that it may not be reliable, and most likely has a subjective spin to it.)

No. Unfortunately, things just got worse and worse. Tom’s partner, who decided that she wanted to be with Tom now that he was making out with someone that wasn’t her, decided to start having sex with him again after a six-month dry spell. They tried to work things out for about three months, insisting things were getting better while things continually got worse and they continued cheating on each other. Finally, Tom broke up with his partner. Cue Tom’s ex-partner losing her shit and Tom being a waffling pansy who can’t stick to a decision. She accused him of abandoning her and of lying to her. The lying part was true, since it took him about two weeks to tell her that he’d kissed me. She also told him the fact that he wanted to date me made her sick, since I was eight when he was eighteen. She suggested that he just fuck me as a side chick and then get back together with her. She told him that she loved him and that she was sorry for everything that she had done.

Meanwhile, I was caught in the middle, trying to support Tom as a friend and trying not to 1) end up as ‘that rebound girl’ and 2) trying not to get in anyone’s way, since I’d already caused enough trouble by being an idiot.

I liked Tom. I still do now, but holy shit, the amount of drama he caused by absolutely refusing to make a decision based on ‘not wanting to hurt anyone’   (which is fucking horrible logic—the more you drag something out, the worse it is for everyone involved) was insane. 

I tried to stay out of it as best I could, but the whole horrible thing came to a head when, about a month after Tom and his partner had broken up, she showed up while we were hanging out at his house and started yelling at him and throwing things. I left him to work it out with her, because that isn’t my problem. He still wanted to remain friends with his ex, who I still feel is only friends with him because she wants to get back together.

Tom has made it clear that he would like to date me after he has time to recover from this past relationship, but I’m not sure if I should date him, seeing all of the drama that he went though with his ex. I still love Tom dearly, but I don’t know if he’ll ever get over his ex or realize that she’s going to be a burden on whatever relationship (friends or not) we have for a very long time. Every time we hang out, even now that they’re not dating, she turns into a crying, raging mess and he tries to pacify her by avoiding me for a few days and telling me how much he cares about her and loves her before he blows up at her and wants her out of his life before the whole cycle begins again.

**So my question to you, r/relationships/ is what do I do next?** Do I walk away from the clusterfuck? Stick it out and hope things calm down? Drop Tom and run? Just stay friends? Do nothing and mind my own goddamn business?

I know I don’t want to date anyone for a long while after this, including Tom, mostly because seeing a relationship fall apart in such an ugly, manipulative, and horrific way was awful to watch.

Anyway, if you made it through that horrid, confusing mess, thank you. If not:

tldr: high school sweehearts. he cheated. we broke up. then we got back together in every way except in name. then we cut contact. met up again this summer--i'm catching the feels. he is completely over me. what to do? 

We started dating in 8th grade. We dated throughout high school. Tried the whole long distance scthick when we both started college in different states. Didn't work out so well--communication issues mostly on his part, codependency on my part, and incompatibility both ways. Nevertheless, we decided to stay together for the next year. Sophomore year, things were getting better but for the wrong reasons. He studied abroad and the time difference meant communication grew more and more sparse. I joined a sorority and started getting more involved on campus. We were clearly growing apart but both of us were too scared to break it off--after all, we grew up together and were best friends, same friend group, told each other everything and did everything together. Then during finals period, I found out from a mutual friend that he fooled around with a girl at the club earlier that spring. To be honest, I didn't even believe it at first. But I was convinced that I needed to break it off just because it wasn't working out. Of course, while I was making that phone call, I had to ask him about what had happened that night. And lo and behold, he had cheated on me. And so I broke up with him and promptly cut contact. We didn't talk until after we were both back at home for winter break which was about a month later. 

We met up during winter break for a reconciliation of sorts. Unfortunately, both of us weren't over each other yet so we ended up spending way too much time together, falling into old habits, and hooking up. When we both went back to school, we tried to stay in touch. But I ended up falling off the deep end--just a lot of partying, drugs, and meaningless sex to distract me from my heartbreak. So we ended up losing touch for a while. For a long while. By the end of summer, I was pretty confident that I was over him. I hadn't thought about him in months. I no longer felt anything when he popped up on my social media feed. As a result, when he texted me to meet up this summer, I thought this would be a great opportunity to show him how well I was doing without him. 

Well, I was wrong about that. I have always had an issue with my pride, and this time I clearly overestimated myself. We started spending more and more time together. And lo and behold, I end up catching the feels, again. Except, this time he doesn't. He is friendly but never oversteps any boundaries. As soon as I realized that I was in the danger zone, I talked to him about cutting contact again because I clearly was still not over him. He agreed although he was disappointed. We mutually agreed to not talk or meet in person until winter break, that is if I were to contact him first. 

I think we both handled the thing very maturely. The problem is, I haven't stopped crying since I spoke with him. It feels like I'm breaking up with him a second time, except this time I'm the only one who's hurting. Now I know that in a way my situation is pathetic because he is the one who cheated on me and yet I'm the one who's still pining. I myself feel pretty pathetic right now. I have no doubt that he regrets cheating and still cares for me. But this still doesn't make it easier. 

I guess my question is how do I get over this person who at one point I truly loved and cared for? Any tips or advice would be nice. I just need to move on with my life because I know we're never going to work as a couple.

12614,Breakups,2z2rl8,"Wall of text, but this story isn't complete without some sort of preamble...

So two years ago I meet this tiny, very shy, very cute girl at a friend's house party. She kinda kept to herself and no one really seemed to try to talk to her, so I talked to her just being friendly. At some point after the party died out it was just she and I on a couch talking about things we're interested in, and which things overlap. We hook up that night (which she has always insisted was a total fluke because that was the first and last time she's had a one-night stand).

After that I go about my business and ask her to lunch because I'm really attracted to this girl and she's only in town for a short time. Us meeting was a total chance encounter and there's something special about this person.

While at lunch I intended to pay for her meal, she declined saying she wasn't hungry. No big deal I guess. Later that day she tells me that she doesn't eat because she's bulimic. She goes on to tell me that she has Borderline Personality Disorder. She has a very low self-esteem, she self-harms regularly, she doesn't do well meeting people or making friends, which is why meeting me was so special.

At this stage in my life I was very selfish with my time and felt that any time spent around someone who brings misfortune and unhappiness on themselves will only harm you as well. So I kinda got turned off hard.

Another reason meeting her then and there was special is because that summer I was geared up to move only two months later.

So I move states away and at some point we do keep in touch through fb chat. Mostly just being friendly and sharing music. I always had a feeling she still liked me. She made it sound like meeting me was a huge deal and how much she really liked me. I had several other things going on in my life and (while I always maintained a crush on her) left it alone. I always had a feeling that one day I would want to be with her.

Throughout our friendship we talk like friends. For instance she'd tell me about a boy who is interested in her and how nervous she is in social settings. By her own admission these dates would never go anywhere because she doesn't open up to anyone easily and is very anxious by default.

Jump to winter of 2014, we're still talking and being friends. We start talking more often, even calling each other which didn't happen often. I had finally reached a point where I felt I could express feelings to her. She's only dated one person ever. Is very aversive to the idea of romantic relationships. We start talking daily, it start hinting at having feelings for her. She and I make plans for her to drive and stay with me for christmas and some days. She drives from 20 hours away by herself and she was shy with me again at first but I do my best to try to make her at ease. I tell her I really like her, I've always had feelings for her that I just didn't want to act on until now. She likes the idea of dating but is afraid it will only end in pain. I say nonsense! (I'm a very positive, gung-ho you can always turn a shitty situation around kind of guy). I tell her when we met I was sort of a dick and would've been too much for her sensitive ways. These days I'm a lot more empathetic and I would be a great boyfriend to her.

It took some convincing but once she returned home she asks if I'm her boyfriend. I say yes of course, dummy.

A little before new year's eve we are officially dating long distance. A friend of mine was in a long distance relationship for about a year and they now live together. He tells me that to make a LDR work you need to talk every single day to that person. I tell her and she seems pleased having someone that cares about her to talk to everyday.

So we date and talk everyday. I've always been good about dating a girl but never making her the center of my universe. Being stern when someone disrespects you. 

Everything starts out fine, we're happy. Eventually her poor self-esteem starts showing up. She says she's unsure of how I feel about her because she really just doesn't like herself. She needs to hear me tell her nice things; that she's not ugly, how much she means to me, that she's not fat (which by the way she is the tiniest, skinniest person I know).

At first this puts me off because I've never had a girlfriend NEED to hear these things often. And I mean often. Almost every day. But I feel like she is perfect for me and that I can help her with her problems. We can overcome them together and date forever. I'm in love with this person, so I'm happy to help them in any way I can.

What I don't know is that all the things I'd say when I'm reassuring her are also cementing the idea of her being perfect for me in my own mind. This is the opposite of how I've handled any relationship prior. I've always been the one being loved. I wouldn't have it any other way, but this girl is the exception. I feel good about making it clear to her that she's the only girl I want and that if we weren't dating I still wouldn't look for anyone else.

The entirety of our friendship has been founded on our first impressions of each other. I'm a relatively popular person, more so at that time. She very few friends but only one who she really consistently talks to. She often tells me that I'm too good for her, and that I've always known that I'm better than her. It's flattering to hear but I want her to feel good about herself so I always deflect these statements.

I cannot pinpoint when it happened but it becomes normal, expected behavior on my part to take on for her. Anything at all. 'Oh you went out with a friend and are outside the venue feeling anxious? Sure I'll tell my friend to pause the movie and I'll go somewhere to talk to you'
Then there are the 5-6 hour long arguments that never really seem to reach a resolution. In my experience an argument with any level-headed person should be resolved promptly. Not with this girl.

*Also I need to mention that I'm pretty possessive in relationships and get jealous easily. She is a tiny, adorable, submissive person by nature and having low self-esteem sets her up for liking attention from guys, but trying to bow out from these things. She just likes knowing when strangers think she's not ugly.

She frequently mentions how so-and-so at work said she's adorable, this person wants to cook dinner for her, this person said he wanted to fuck her under his breath. Whatever, I'm a cute guy and get plenty attention from girls but I'm completely devoted and am flattered but indifferent toward the attention I receive. 

I start feeling anxious about how she acts when I'm not around. I start researching BPD and find that cheating and lying are typical. I bring it up and she insists that (due to a childhood experience) she is actually very sexually aversive. This makes sense why she often shuts down during sex. But I still feel like she could very easily be cheating and still talking to me everyday and I would have no idea. This all happens when she wasn't answering calls/texts on Valentine's day. I come to the conclusion that she does have a boyfriend from town and a LDR (me). It takes a lot of convincing (I'm very stubborn) but she gets me to realize I've been wrong. She's not that kind of person. I leave it be, and promise to just trust that she won't fuck me over. She has only had four sex partners and I was the second. Now the fifth.

Sometimes my jealousy flares up but I'm good about shrugging it off and telling myself I'm just being stupid. (My stubborn jealousy plays a very crucial role in the end).

Anyway, now we're at a point where it's just normal for her to talk over me, not hear what I say. It's pretty much all about her. Which is totally fine and slightly amusing to me because when else does she get to feel like this? I try so hard (too hard in retrospect) to be the best bf I can and to never do or say anything that might set her off into one of her panic/self-harm episodes. I just kinda let her verbally abuse me when she gets bad. Something I never tolerated from anyone.

CUT TO THIS PAST WEEK (if you're still reading, thank you)
I make plans to fly out to where she lives and stay for my spring break. This is partly to prove how much she means to me because it's the first time she's ever had someone come visit HER instead of the other way around.

I show up the first day and it's great. She shows me around the town, takes me here and there and we go hiking.

While hiking she makes a comment about long-haired guys with no shirts being nearby. I'm high on a pot cookie and feeling very uncomfortable. We go somewhere to sit and I'm not saying much because I'm fuming. Earlier that day while walking through town she says I don't get as many stares from guys when I have a boy around. It sounded to me like she meant that it bummed her out. 
She says the long-haired guys comment was to mock them. 'Look at how cool the white boys with dreads are' kind of thing.
She says that the lack of stares comment was that she felt safe being around me. She doesn't like attention paid to her. 
Sure.
Then while trying to comfort me and my jealousy, she calls me the wrong name. For the second time that day. The name belongs to a friend who moved with her out to the midwest and is someone who she has never been involved with, liked, or done anything physical with. Even when they lived at a hotel for a few months and shared a bed. They're just friends. But in my mental state I come to the conclusion that she's been lying to me all this time.

She and that friend (or someone else) have been hooking up and she's been playing me.

We get in the car and she's more upset than I've ever seen her before. I'm still saying tell me the fucking TRUTH she claims she's been 100% faithful. Now she's out of control, red in the face, almost demonic, shouting at me, banging her head against her headrest, etc.

And then she exclaims I don't want to live anymore and guns it full speed down this mountain. I'm shouting for her to stop. I pull the e-brake and exit the car. Plenty of onlookers to witness this all happening. I'm mortified. She's crying and says she'll be more careful. Sure enough she gets mad again and starts driving recklessly. I'm faaaaaaar too high to be able to handle the situation. I coax her into calming down enough to not wreck. 
I tell her I want to stop somewhere to get a drink. I really just wanted to get out of the car and make her give me the keys. I try to get the keys from her and she starts making yet another scene in front of people in cars RIGHT NEXT to us. Again, I'm the most embarrassed I've ever been in my life. I don't ever get embarrassed. She does on a daily basis.

She takes me back to her house, where she lives with girls that she doesn't talk to or even look at when she manages to leave her room. One of these same roommates stood up for her on the phone on Valentine's day when I didn't believe she'd been home all night. But I digress.

We're in her room (this is still the same day my plane landed) in the basement of the house. She and I argue ALL NIGHT. She pleads for me to believe her, she bangs her head against the wall (I was aware that she does this, I'd just never seen it). She grabs scissors and is pushing me and very angry with me. I seriously think this girl is going to hurt me. 

We calm down enough to sleep in the same bed. I wake up to her making herself pretty in the mirror, which she does everyday (I've sat with her on skype a lot). She wants everything to be fine.
I'm still reeling from the first day and I'm still convinced that she has been fucking someone else. I be as nice and as terse as I can to not set off another incident.
I've already decided I'm getting the fuck out of here. I gather my things and tell her I'm taking a cab to a motel. She wants to drive me, and says she'll give me my space but doesn't want me to leave and is crying. I get to the motel and just decide, fuck it I'll just fly back today.

So I do. She thinks I'm at a motel. I tell her in between flights that I've already set off for home. She say's that's okay [petname].

I cannot believe this girl! I get home and am an emotional wreck. I clean the house like never before, play a lot of guitar to distract myself. I'm trying to piece everything together and I'm now feeling like she tricked me every step of the way. I feel like everything she's ever told me was a lie. She tailor-made an image for herself in my mind (apparently this is typical of those with BPD).

I inevitably text and call her to find out some answers. Throughout the week I waiver on my beliefs. She lied about everything... no I'm just crazy and stubborn! Before I came in town she was anxious and said something about being afraid that I'll break up with her after I stay with her for a week and head home.
So now I feel like al that really happened was she manipulated me into breaking up with her.

She doesn't feel safe being alone in her room, which she rarely leaves so she takes a plane back south to visit her mom and the few friends she has who live there.

We play this back and forth texting game of we can work it out, I miss you, yadda yadda. She claims that she's been crying, unable to sleep and has worn my jacket everywhere she's been while in town.

I talk it out with a friend and she helps me realize some things about how insecure I've been and how mentally ill this girl is.

Today I call her and tell her that, while I still have strong feelings for her, I'm not in a good place right now and would rather have nothing to do with her. She says she still wants to talk and like each other. I say I lost myself. I've never EVER let anyone influence my emotions the way this girl did. We agree to go back to not talking and maybe, MAYBE still talking down the road.

After all of this I still love this girl deeply. I wanted so badly to help her overcome some of her obvious difficulties, but now it seems like all I did was develop some of my own.

It pains me to have to sever ties. I'm still deluded enough to think that instead of being my usual heavy-handed self, the reason it all went wrong is because I basically let her walk all over me. I want to continue dating her but usher in a new phase of my normal, 'not putting up with your shit' attitude.

But I'm at a loss. I know that I pushed a lot of friends away while dating her, didn't do as well in school. But I was super happy, confident and motivated.

I've decided to just let things be. Not talk to her, redirect my focus back to school, friends, hobbies. But I still want her. I still want to redeem myself.

------------------------------------
If anyone can offer some insight, maybe a similar story, just anything to help me better understand what the fuck just happened in these 3 months.

12617,Infidelity,1xblac,"I'll *try* to summarize this:

I caught my boyfriend receiving sexts in the summer, after a year of dating. Broke my heart. He begged me to not leave, saying he got caught up in this girl sending him unsolicited pictures of her new nipple pearcings, and it went too far (as in he was enjoying it, as per text messages). He had always been the model boyfriend: kind, thoughtful, considerate, loving, affectionate, list goes on...). Since then I've forgiven him, given him a second chance. And while a small part of me wonders what things he's been doing, I've learned to trust him again. 
Until last night. 

Found texts on his phone from a classmate confessing her feelings for him and it went like this 
 Her: I just want to know an answer if you want this or not. If not, I want to be able to be stress free and focus on studying for this next two weeks. I want to know if you're in this or not

His Response: Of Course I'm still in it. I just pretty much spent the last couple days in bed from being sick. I enjoy your company and would like to hang out in the future, but in all honesty if you're looking for something serious I am going to be very busy this semester and may be leaving for work come summer so I won't have a lot of my time to give to you :(

Her: haha I expected as much. I am very open to see where this goes. I like you. I enjoy being with you. Yesterday when everything went wrong you were the first person I wanted to talk to

His Response: Awe:) Well I will definitely be here for you to talk to as much as I can, And yes it's probably best to see where this goes



Heart break round 2. He's not upfront about anything when I ask him aside from saying if you read some texts where I crossed the boundaries, and didn't wisely word things, that's the only thing I can think of

to paraphrase, after mulling over whether or not to dump his ass,  seeing him cry in front of me for the first time in front of me, and me having a really hard time on just up and leaving something that is otherwise virtually perfect, I decided to stay

Now I feel like I need advice on how to lay out boundaries, and do it fairly.  I don't want to be the crazy girlfriend checking his texts, or snooping, but I also feel like at this point I've earned more of a perspective on an area of his life that would otherwise be private. How do I reasonably lay out expectations to learn to give him one last, and very , very finally chance?

EDIT: I know I sound like a pathetic, sorry doormat. If I was in your shoes I'd think 'wow what a silly blind loser'. But by nature I'm a fiercely loyal gal. In this case, to a fault. SO I believed in exhausting all resources before giving up on the relationship. Cheating is like murder though. You've either murdered someone, or you haven't. You've cheated or you haven't. And once you've done it once, you become better at it and feels less remorse with each try. Knowing this... I still can't help but try.

12620,Relationships,2vbb68,"note about duration: We got together 2 years ago. The issues I'm describing below in part 2 (feeling 'swallowed up,' among other things) caused me to gradually shut down over the course of our relationship, and I sought relief in singlehood, so I left her last July, after ~18mo together. We had been engaged for 5months when I broke up with her.

I spent the last 7 months trying to get over her, and build a new life as an emotionally self sufficient person. It has been incredibly hard on her, since she devoted her whole heart to me and I simply walked out, for hypothetically better ideas about myself. I wasn't there for her when she would reach out to me. I felt cold and distant.

I've been mostly miserable about the breakup for 7 months. Depressed and drinking. I've gone to counseling off and on. I was happy to reconnect with friends, have casual sex, and look at my future as only being obligated to myself. I felt like I was starting to get to a good place with it, but I hadn't fully processed the breakup because I didn't feel safe enough to scream and cry in my housing situation. A month ago I moved into my new place and started to feel at ease to begin the deeper processing of the breakup. But I still hadn't started it yet.

A week ago we had brunch together, and reconnected for the first time since the breakup. I gradually let my guard down since I was beginning to feel better about my life. We spent the entire day together, enjoying the connection so much, and ended up kissing and getting really physical (no sexual contact though).

I went home feeling awesome about it, that we could connect casually and honor our affection without the obligation of relationship.

The next day she asked about my sex history since the breakup. I told her I'd slept with 2 people. She withdrew (understandably).

Therefore I was shown both the connection we used to have (via intimacy and kissing) and what I had done emotionally, shutting her out and distancing myself. The contrast sent me into four days of panic attacks and nausea, the likes of which I've never experienced.

Partly it seemed like this was the deep processing I needed, and partly it was oh god, what have I done, I shouldn't have left her, I should have sought other options panic. 

Over the course of the week she's been a tremendous friend, helping me cope and offering kind words. I've stayed home from work feeling sick and crying, visited two counselors, took the best care of myself I could manage. When I was in a particularly bad place she would spend time with me, which was soothing to me, and I would calm down and sort of regain center. Her capacity to love me seems unbeatable.

I've done the most extensive soul searching and mental reprogramming of my life this week. I eventually came to a place where I know that she's my One, and I understand the changes I need to make internally, in order to function heathfully in our relationship. But things keep changing...

The time we've spent together has been completely spontaneous. Holding boundaries has felt wrong. We are so drawn to each other and just want to share connection and affection. Last night we got together again. I was helping her move some things, and we had dinner, and then we got spontaneously physical again. We ended up going to further physical/intimate boundaries. We haven't had sex in the last 7 months, but last night it was like we made love intensely through kissing and hugging. 

Today I'm completely torn apart again. Back to crying and pacing around my home. The contrast between why I resist her and why I'm drawn to her is unbearable. What's happening to me?

**part 2**
I'm a withdrawn/introverted personality. I can be outgoing/energetic when I'm in a healthy place physically and mentally. 

I'm not really sure what kind of personality my SO is, but she shows both outgoing and withdrawn qualities, IMO.. I tend to think of her as an outgoing/extroverted/assertive type.

I love and adore her (and she loves me unconditionally, moreso than I'm capable of, it sometimes seems).

My problem is I feel swallowed up and overwhelmed by things I don't like about her, about half the time we are together, and during some of the time I think about her, too. I feel incapable of holding my own boundaries and bringing my own energy to the table a lot of the time. I feel too focused on/put off by the qualities in her I dislike when she shows them. And they aren't even bad qualities! They are very likeable ones, they just seem to rub me the wrong way, or feel too rough or aggressive to me. Ways of talking/ranting, ways of wanting to goof around, etc. So I feel bad about even saying anything. They aren't bad qualities at all. She doesn't control me or manipulate me, she's just very vivacious and in my face with games/dancing or talking about friends/work, etc. Sounds like a very fun person, and she is! So what is my problem?

I think partly I've become emotionally dependent on her.. maybe this is the part of me that feels pinched when she's displaying qualities I don't like? 

At other times my heart overflows with love for her and I want her forever. We have an incredibly sweet connection when our energy/mood is matched, and our physical and emotional love/affection is heavenly. We have dozens of like interests and can hold great conversations at times. I've been planning on marrying her but this nagging feeling seems to consume me more and more, and drives me insane with questioning. Why is such a miniscule issue such a big deal?? Is every marriage like this?

As far as I can tell, she just loves spending time with me and barely notices if I feel put off by anything she's doing. She has immense love for me and seems willing to do almost anything for me, but also seems a lot more centered in herself than I am in myself. She seems to operate with a lot more confidence and energy, while I secretly feel tossed around by circumstances/environment. It's not like she's constantly bouncing off the walls.. At times our moods match perfectly and we can sit in candle-lit silence and just smile at each other, stare into each other's eyes, have a calm conversation about life or love or whatever.. etc.. So it's absolutely a mix.

I am having a lot of trouble with my perspective. How do people in other intro/extro relationships operate? Have I picked the wrong person? Why do I feel this way about someone I love so much? How can I stick to just loving her? I know it's just my perception because the way I feel shifts back and forth about it, without her behavior being any different.

I'm reading *Passionate Marriage* by David Schnarch and it's helping a lot. The concepts of differentiation, getting out of emotional fusion, and holding onto myself appeal to me tremendously.

But I'm ~120 pages into the book and it seems to barely hint at my current predicament from time to time. He seems to talk mostly about verbal validation about issues of conflict, not so much about one partner driving themselves insane internally with tiny issues and hangups. Is this just a form of emotional fusion?

I'm somewhat panicked about this issue. I thought I was done crying and freaking out for the week but it started again this morning after last night's intense intimacy. 
   
**tl;dr**: 50/50 mix of feeling gushing love and nagging discontent over some personality traits. Really bent up feeling trapped with things I don't like, and heartbroken at the thought of saying goodbye. How can I stay out of the thoughts I don't like? 

**[edit]** I just realized part of the pinch i feel when she's being vivacious is that I feel guilty that I don't feel the way she feels. I feel guilty/ashamed for feeling lethargic or pensive or romantic when she wants to get up and dance. I feel pinched like I'm supposed to get up and dance and have fun and enjoy life. I feel like a bad person who doesn't enjoy life because I'm so quiet and lack impulses to dance/sing/play/revere.

I have been looking for a roommate for several months and have found a great potential new roommate (Let's say Kyle). He seems quiet, mature and professional. During the summer I have begun taking private pole dancing lessons (fitness-focused mainly...I wear workout clothes to dance) and have really become hooked. During the time that he was deciding on whether or not to take the room, I got a large tax return and treated myself to a 25th birthday present - a new pole. I use one of the rooms in my house as an art studio and I'd like to put the pole up in there as it does not fit in my bedroom. Kyle only pays 1/3 of the rent and I pay 2/3rds since I take up 2 rooms.

I don't know much about him, but a brief facebook check shows that he seems to be in a very committed relationship... Do I have to tell him about my pole dancing before he moves in? Is it *more* awkward to bring it up? He finishes work at 6 and I finish at 3:30 so I would probably only dance while he was at work. Would it be rude not to mention it? Would you be pissed if your boyfriend moved in with a pole dancer without knowing/telling you?

Thank you in advance for your advice. Paying rent for the whole apartment by myself has been expensive and I really don't want to lose Kyle as a potential roommate.

I'm sorry if this all comes out as rambling.. I'm really upset right now and would mostly like to know if my reaction to this has been overblown. I'm so incredibly hurt by this, but maybe it was a reasonable question to ask? I don't know, please be the judge. Also I'm sorry if anything doesn't make sense, English isn't my native language.


I met my fiancee while we were both earning our masters degrees in Europe. She is from the US and I'm from a developing country, let's say Afghanistan for our purposes. We met on the very first day of orientation and hit it off right away. Meeting her was absolute magic and I was practically in love by the end of the week. It's a truly amazing feeling to meet someone from the other side of the planet, from a completely different background and experience than you, who just understands you so completely. We would talk for hours and hours and kissing her for the first time was the happiest moment of my life up until that point.  Cheesy, I know, but we're soul mates. 


The program lasted two years and at the end of it, we both stayed in the country to work (she had a job right away, I was allowed to stay for one year to find work). We've been living there for another two years, so dating four years at this point, living together, spending holidays with family, everything… And started talking about getting married. Even though we love where we are, we decided we wanted to raise our kids around family and if we were going to get serious, we should move back to one of our countries. It really wasn't an option to move to my country, so we began the process of moving to the US, at least mentally. I proposed to her about 6 months after, and nothing in my entire life compared to the moment she said yes. Everything was in line, we set a date for our wedding in the States and started figuring out visa issues.


For the past few days my fiancee has been upset about something. She's been a little on edge and I finally confronted her about it yesterday. I just held her hands and asked her to please, please tell me what's bothering her. It was so obvious to me that something was wrong. She was just looking at me and started crying and said, Would you still be marrying me if I didn't have a US passport? I was completely in shock by this question and I asked her what she meant. Are you just marrying me for a green card? 


I was so hurt and angry I couldn't even form a proper response. I started crying too and demanded to know why she would ask me such a thing. We had been talking about getting married and moving home to raise a family forever! Moving back to my country was completely out of the question, for me, my wife, and my future children. It's not the environment my family should live in. I was so angry I said to her over and over Is this what you think of me? Is this what you think our relationship is?… Eventually I just stormed out. She didn't really say anything. I ended up leaving the apartment and went for walk and when I came back she was trying to apologize and explain to me that it was cold feet and random irrational fears she was having. I could barely bring myself to listen, though. Nothing has really been repaired between us.


Reddit this woman is the love of my life and we had such a powerful, instant connection, is it wrong to be so hurt that she would even suggest this could just be for a visa? I have a job in this country, and could get permanent residency in just a couple years! Why would I need to marry her just for a ticket to the US? I just feel so betrayed.

I could see that she is really really interested and I would be too if i wasn't leaving in 12 days for the army and she knows this too but continues to pursue.

12624,Breakups,1whaoe,"Dear people, I'm sorry I have to start with this cliche statement: I dunno how should I start, so allow me to be straight to the point. I'm not good with words, and English is not my mother language.

So I met this guy through OkC, he is the happy go lucky type while I'm a pragmatic one, stated it clearly on my profile. So we dated and it's been good. It's a long distance, but his town is just one and half hour flying-away. It's been like 4 months and we flew toward each other three times already. He has this so-called bff, a couple whom he knows since teenage years, basically they are his confidantes.

Tonight, I just knew through his bff that how he wishes I can look better. I'm fully aware that I've never been the prettiest girl in the room, and I don't put much effort on my look but I never allow myself to appear shitty either. I'm a working professional in a creative industry, and so far people even ask me for fashion advice and stuff to buy. Perhaps it's just his fashion taste is too high (he does tumblr-ing a lot, and shopping at Mr. Porter while I'm content with Forever 21, Uniqlo, and Zara).

What hurts me more is he once said (in their very lively group chat): 1) All his exes are high standards 2) His feeling to me is somewhat different. Sometime he said he doesn't miss me, even interchangeably loving me less and more.

Heaven knows how disappointed I am when I heard that.

He's not in good situation at the moment, and he even asked me to leave him, saying I better look for better guy. I consider it's as an insult toward our relationship because I'm not that kind of girl. I'm always willing to accept him and believe things gonna change, and we can work it out. I can't do much since we are in LDR and I have to struggle with work, family matters, and what-nots but I always try to be nice and supportive for him. To me grading someone high and low is so degrading. I can't believe he did that to me. I know his ex is hot and she's like trophy wife you saw on movies, I have very good looking ex too, but I never brag it unless he asked, and yea he really did.

I confronted him with two questions on the aforementioned topic, he confirmed both with yes. Immediately asked for a break up, and already cut everything off. Deleted him from social media sites, trashing all the messages, even uninstalled Avocado on my phone. His bff still been trying to contact me though, telling he doesn't even look sad, just confused, and as this message is being written, I believe they are dining out somewhere. 

So people, I would appreciate if you can leave your opinion. What should I do? Am I dating a jerk? Should I reconcile once he is asking to? Have you ever been in similar situation? If so, what did you do?

12625,Relationships,1otud7,"So there is this girl who i have known for about a year now, i run a club with her in my university. I always thought she was cute, but never really talked to her seriously until a few weeks ago when we started getting really busy with our club events, and i was talking to her every other day. We got along really well, and started talking more. At one of our events, she sits on my lap, and i know something is up. Later that night she texts me, saying she doesnt know what it is about me, but she hasnt felt like this about a guy since she met her boyfriend, three years ago.


About me : i JUST got out of a four year relationship. 3 of the four years were long distance, and it had been going down hill for a long time. I was still in love with her but it was coming. Im talking about early september recent. So thats done, i was pretty sad of course,it was my first real relationship, first sexual partner, first girl i loved, all of that. It sucked. still sucks. Been really busy lately, doing things for myself (overcoming depression, becoming busier etc) and it really wasnt that hard. I was doing well.

Her: dated this guy for three years, she tells me she wants to marry him and she is super confused because she hasnt been attracted to another guy since she met her boyfriend, especially a white guy. 

So heres whats been going on. After she texted me, i told her i thought she was really cute, and things sort of snowballed from there. We talked all night, and it got pretty hot and she guiltily told me the things she would do to me if i was there, explicilty. Told me all her fantasies, things like that. She wanted me, bad. I REALLY wanted her too. I leave for a bit, come back a few hours later she tells me it was a mistake and it shouldnt have happened, and we cant do it again. Next night, we talk all night again and it happens again, but this time WAY more kinky, the stuff that makes you have dreams for years and years. Then she tells me to delete it, we cant do it again, she has a boyfriend who she loves and doesnt want to hurt.

Next day, talk all night again. Im talking like, 8pm-5am kinda thing, we are talking about everything. she loves to talk to me, i love to talk to her. And i cant stop thinking about her. she told me that she thought about me when she was fucking her boyfriend, and she doesnt know what it is about me. But, she also started to change the way she spoke to me. It was almost like i was getting friend zoned, she wasnt talking to me like she was ready to jump my pants at any second anymore. She seems like she just wants to be friends now.

So we are still talking all night, im telling her i think shes cute and i like her, shes telling me she thinks im hot and things, trading pictures from when we were younger or whatever, and we get to the point where im telling her i cannot stop thinking about her, but she tells me she couldnt see us dating or holding hands or anything.. its purely sexual i guess? I dont really know. So that kinda bums me cus im really getting into this girl now, and i ask her to tell me that if i dont have a chance, and she isnt into me, to straight up tell me so i can go get over it. And she says, YOU DONT HAVE A CHANCE tells me that she enjoys our friendship and talking to me., im sad, so i kinda stop talking to her for 5-10 min and she tells me that she didnt say the other part, and i told her that ive never met a girl who has driven me insane the way she is doing to me right now. i say something to the extent of id kiss you if i couldand she says, accidents happen, and then says she shouldnt have said that, etc etc. and is still super flirty with me, like we didnt miss a beat. 

i dont know what hte fuck to do, ive nevr EVER thought that i would cheat on someone, or do anything with someone who has a boyfriend but jesus christ i want this girl. Id date her if i could. Its only been a month since my past gf so i dont know if its some weird emotional thing but i cannot get her out of my head. I dont know if she is playing me or what, but i think she genuinely wants to be my friend too. Ive asked her to come to concerts, coffee and w.e else with me, and shes said yes to every one. Shes never been to a concert.  Ive probably missed a lot, ill add to it if i remember. its almost 6 am. Sorry. Had to get this off my chest because its driving me fucking insane. She keeps saying things like youll find a nice girl someday, but like, thats the thing i really dont give a shit about any other girls right now and i definitely didnt until she started talking to me like this. Should i just stop talking to her? Should i stop flirting and just stay friends? Should i continue, and try to make something happen, to show her that we could date? I dont know how her relationship with her boyfriend is, but can it be that good if she is saying all these things to me? I think she feels endebted to him or something for helping her out of depression. She sends me snapchats at least twice a day, just of faces smiling at me saying things like, i was cold today so im wearin a scarf ;)

I was totally smitten when I first met her, she lit up every room she walked into and really was a head turner. Not only that, she knew who Carl Sagan was, liked classic rock, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and a bunch of other geek-y stuff. She also had the same birthday as Albert Einstein. She literally walked out of my dreams. 

She convinced me we were soul mates, that she had a dream of marrying a guy with my name (which means 'eternal'), that she thought I looked like Robert Downey, that our signs Pisces and Capricorn are the perfect fit. blah, blah, blah. I've never had a girl be THAT into me. It was intoxicating, I was hooked.

Only one problem, she was fucking crazy, had little empathy for anyone, and had cheated on a few of her previous boyfriends. Her own brother warned me about her narcissism after a year of being together, of course I didn't listen though. Overtime, I also discovered she was only a little interested in science, but she played it up around me.  She pretended to be into bands that I was into but only knew like 2 songs, same thing about books, movies, and games. It was a pattern that extended to everything, it was always everyone else and never her that was the problem. 

She lies basically about everything BUT she looks exactly like the girl of my dreams ON FACEBOOK. She can't cook to save her life, her parents pay for everything including her Benz and all her clothes, she wants to get breast implants even though I told her how lovely her A-cups are. 

I really did try my best to love this girl, help her love herself so she didn't lie so much...but nothing got her to realize she wasn't the center of creation and that being 'a 9/10' doesn't make you better than every other girl.

Not sure what I am looking for or if I am even looking for advice. I think I just need a place to write this all out and receive some feedback about my situation since I can't think clearly with all these emotions running through my head.


So.. back story. I dated my ex for 4.5 years. We met at university in our first year and dated ever since. While attending university, I had a lot of school-stress going on while also balancing working a part-time job to pay my tuition, rent, gas, insurance and bills on my own. I had to juggle work, school and being in a relationship but I made sure to manage my time well to make time for all aspects. 


Then comes third year and my grades really took a huge hit. I know I wasn't doing well. My GPA was so low and I was really disappointed in myself for letting my grades sink that far. I was required to withdraw from the university and work back on my grades at another institution in order to transfer back in. I was embarrassed that I let my grades get that low (I am very hard on myself). My parents were disappointed as well (I had a difficult time telling them this..it took me days to prepare myself to muster up the confidence to tell them). But they understood and encouraged me to work my way back into the university. 

I was scared to tell my ex-boyfriend, but no where near as frightening as telling my parents. I grabbed the courage and told him what happened and I was really hoping for some support since when he failed his classes I was there to comfort him and encourage him when he attempts to take the course again. But instead, he dumped me saying he couldn't date someone who dropped out of university or with a GPA that low. I was deeply hurt. I cried all day and night. I felt horrible about myself as a person and what he said really did convince me that I was stupid/an idiot.


A couple weeks later he came back and apologized and we talked about it. He wanted to work on it and support me into getting back into the university. I took him back. We broke up one other time after that incident. The other breakup was when my phone died I asked to borrow his phone to call my friend when we were out. While I was punching the phone number in, his text message notification popped up and one of his close female friends wrote, If you're not serious about her then why are you with her? You said she's not what you want.. then why are you dating her?! I was hurt. I am well aware that I am not the most physically attractive girl but I do consider myself average. I never once doubted in him and trusted him so I never looked through his phone or his Facebook...basically he never gave me a reason to not trust him. I didn't even bother calling my friend with his phone after and asked him what that message was all about. Immediately, he broke up with me because he said I invaded his privacy. I apologized profusely for reading his messages even though I feel like he was shifting the blame on me. We got back together again.


We rarely fight when we are together though.  He was my best friend and I was his. But I always felt something was off in our relationship. While we were together, I was always the one to pay for dinners/dates since he never had a job (and never got one when we were together), drive him home (he doesn't have a driver license either), paid for everything when we go on vacation. But it frustrated me sometimes that he wasn't motivated to find a job or get his drivers license because I was starting to get exhausted with driving and paying for everything. But I put those thoughts aside, and told myself that everyone goes through life at a different pace.


Flash forward half a year later, I manage to get my grades back up and was able to transfer back in. When I got back in to the university, my ex wanted to take on a volunteer position and asked what I thought about the opportunity. I encouraged him to go for it and he did. He introduced me to a friend at his volunteer place and we instantly clicked. I love meeting new people as I am a people-person. I love getting to know people more and having stimulating conversations with the new people I meet. I have good relationships with all his friends and best friend. I actually met the female friend who texted him in our other break up before I met him. We were close also but after that incident, I didn't speak to her again. She and my ex have this bro-sis friendship because they know each other since they were 3. I knew this and I never tried to stand in between them as I know that their friendship was longer and I trusted her and him. But I was taken by surprise when I read that message because we were close friends and that really damaged the trust I had with my ex. I know they didn't do anything with each other because she has a boyfriend who she is super loyal to and they have dated for a long time so I know she and my ex didn't do anything together. At least I'd like to think that way.


So the first semester I got back in, I got to know his friend (from volunteer) that he introduced me to really well. A couple months later, his friend finally messaged me and told me that he couldn't keep pretending to not know anything any more and told me that my ex was cheating on me with some girl that also volunteers with them. I was devastated. I was so upset I had no idea what to do, what to think and who to talk to.


I didn't even want to go to class after I found out. I didn't know how to confront him about it or if I should even tell him that his friend told me. After thinking about it for a week (and avoiding him by telling him I have a lot of school work to do so I wouldn't have to see him), I finally stepped my foot on it and broke up with him when I caught him at the volunteer place with the girl so I wouldn't have to expose that his friend told me.


His friends and best friends soon find out that we broke up and they all knew because he posted a picture of him with the girl and changed his relationship status to in a relationship with [girls name] a day after we broke up. They asked me what happened and I told them things just didn't work out and he found someone else that makes him happy. I never told his friends about him cheating because I didn't want his friends to think of him as a bad person.


The first three weeks of the breakup was really painful. I had no motivation to go to school, but I knew I had to and I can't drop out again. I didn't call in sick for work because I didn't want to let the break up get the best of me and screw me over. Work kept me busy and occupied so I saw work as a means of escape. After work and doing my school work, I would stay in my room all day listening to Beyonce and watching He's Just Not That Into You, while eating icecream and cookies. Typical breakup scenarios girls do. I wanted to call my girlfriends but I didn't want to bother anyone so I just kept everything to myself. I didn't want to tell my mom because I didn't want her to worry.


I maintained NC really well as I also read a lot of post-breakup-self-help books and all of them said to not talk to your exes. I followed that advice. He did text me a couple times but I never opened them and I never read them. I didn't answer any phone calls, facebook messages or emails. I knew that in order for me to get better, I have to completely cut him out of my life. I wanted nothing to do with him.


Now its 7 months after our break up, I am feeling a lot better and was just really happy with myself and where I am. I am doing better in school and I also picked up an amazing job. I am taking up a lot of activities that my ex never wanted to do like JKD, rock climbing, guitar lessons, archery. I didn't jump into a relationship right after the breakup since we dated for 4.5 years and I wasn't anywhere near ready to open up to someone else again.


Then this happened. I got a text message from a number I didn't recognize. I opened it and surely, it was my ex. Either he got a new number or he was using someone's phone. He texted me asking me if I could talk to his best friend to stop posting things on his facebook. I thought that was weird because I distanced myself from his friends because I didn't want to strain his relationship with his friends or make them takes sides. I didn't reply him but I messaged that friend afterwards and asked what any of this has to do with me? Or why would he go lengths to message me to talk to his own best friend?


His best friend told me that he's been acting like a douchebag and has cancelled last minute on their hangouts with their other guy friends to go out with his current girlfriend. He would also bring her out with them sometimes without telling them and it pissed them off when they wanted to just have an all guys night.


It was then his best friend found out on Facebook that my ex posted somewhere how long he has been dating the current girl. He did the math and realized that they dated before breaking up with me. His best friend was cheated on before so this triggered him to react that way and he really liked me as a friend. He posted mean things on my ex's wall like You should be ashamed of yourself. Dating since September? wtf. I thought that was a bit dramatic and told him to calm down and that I am over it. I also thought it was immature of him to post things like that on Facebook. I thanked him for standing up for me and told him that I have put it all behind me. He eventually stopped but he also deleted my ex off all his social networks. I was really surprised because I never thought his best friend would react that way..seeing as they were really close.


My ex texted me after and blaming me for turning all his friends against him. I never texted him since our break up so he assumed that I just ignored his text and didn't try to help him mend his friendship with his best friend. I talked to his best friend and said that what happened between me and my ex is between us, there is no need to involve other parties. He said that it didn't matter and that what he wrote/said to my ex is his own choice. He said that I owe my ex nothing and that I don't need to try to repair their friendship. He said my ex is no longer my responsibility and that I have to stop caring/babying him around. He also said that if my ex wanted to repair their friendship, he would speak up himself instead of texting me to repair it for him.


His friends started to ask me to come to board games nights/pub nights to hang out but I always decline because it just feels wrong to me and I feel bad if I hang out with his friends and them not inviting him. Even his friend from the volunteer place who told me about my ex cheating, texted me out of the blue and told me he doesn't hang out with my ex anymore and invited me to hang out with him and his other friends.


Even though I am overwhelmed by this support, I feel confused, upset and also bad. I talked to my girlfriends and they all said that what my ex's best friend did was his own choice and that I shouldn't need to worry about it - he is not longer part of my life. But I still feel bad and I still feel like I need to repair his friendship with his best friend.


I am not sure what to think, feel or do...it just doesn't feel right for me to not do anything.

I’m currently a college student and met my current boyfriend about a month into the school year (about 11 months ago). We started dating 7 months ago and things have been awesome, I love him to pieces and I know he loves me. At the beginning of May, we entered a brief long distance relationship until September, as we live in different countries (me, US and him, Canada) and can only see each other during the school year for the time being. He frequently tells me how much he loves me and that he’s never cared about anyone as much and how he can’t wait to start a life together after graduation, so he never really gave me a reason not to trust him. Recently, however, I realized that he has been telling some huge lies about his ex-girlfriend. 

The first time he mentioned her was sometime before we started dating. According to him, they dated for a while (he never told me how long) but he broke it off before he moved to college because he did not want to do long distance with her. Apparently, she got super upset and unfriended him on Facebook and deleted all their pictures together on social media. He called her a “vain, conceited bitch.”

Flash forward to one day early on when we’re dating and he’s feeling jealous about a hookup I had months before we started dating. He brings up that his ex is a part-time model and how “just naturally gorgeous” she was and how every time he left her side at a bar, he’d come back to find her surrounded by men. Apparently “she was very good about it” and never gave him a reason not to trust her.
 
Flash forward again to a time when he’s really drunk and we’re talking. Someone mentions how unattractive it is for a girl to be stupid and my boyfriend says that he doesn’t agree necessarily, he focuses more on personality. His ex comes up somehow and he begins talking about her, telling me what college she goes to. I ask him if he would ever date a girl that was just plain airheaded and he said “if she looked like my ex, I would.” 

Final flash forward to our winter recess. He lives in Canada and I live in the US so we both went back home (I couldn't travel with him because my parents wanted me home). He went on vacation with old high school friends (not including his ex though) to Europe. While on vacation there, we were talking late one night when he mentioned how dumb his friends were. When I asked what he meant, he said how his ex had posted a selfie the night before on Instagram (he sent me the picture) and how his buddies were scrolling through his Instagram account on his phone (I don’t have an Instagram, for the record) and posted a rude comment (they are familiar with his girlfriend as they all went to high school together). Apparently, he had to do some “major damage control” afterwards. I eventually found his ex’s Facebook profile (they’re not friends though), and sure enough, she’s fucking flawless. Strangely enough, she’s “married” to my boyfriend’s best friend on Facebook, and they have a few intimate pictures together.

None of these incidents really got to me at all until this summer. Again, I couldn't travel with him because my parents are rather strict and want me to be close to home. His parents are much more lax so he’s able to travel a lot. About a week after classes ended, he and about 15 of his high school friends went to Europe again. He had told me a few weeks earlier that his ex-girlfriend would be going as well since she’s also close with that friend group, and I was pretty confident in the strength of our relationship and wasn't bothered at all.

One morning while we’re messaging and he’s in Europe, he brings up how silly one of his friends is. I ask why and he says one of his friends named “Jess” had snapchatted two pictures of herself earlier that day to his friends, including his father, which made for “an awkward conversation.” He sends me the two pictures and sure enough, they’re of his ex, whose name is definitely not Jess. I brush it off as weird that he’s not using her real name, attributing to the fact that he doesn’t know that I know who she is and doesn’t want me to find out for some strange reason. 

Another day, we’re talking and he says that “Jess” wanted to say hi in “the creepiest way.” He sends me a pic of his ex looking down at the camera doing a duck face. I assumed she had playfully took his phone to take a selfie of herself to send to me so I laughed and said to tell her I said hi back.  That same day, he sends a picture of a bunch of girls (including his ex of course) who appear to be partying with him (he’s not in the picture though) to my sister, who he keeps in touch with (they’re friends). A couple of days later, he sends me a picture of his ex girlfriend doing a smoke trick, saying that he wants to try that one day. At this point I’m getting pretty irritated because out of 15 of his friends, the only person he has spoken about and sent me picture after picture of was “Jess.” He also mentioned her numerous times throughout his trip, saying that he has to drag her everywhere to translate for him because she speaks the language there and how they play beer pong together and chill and “turn the hotel upside down when they’re bored.” He also mentioned once how pathetic guys in the clubs there were because they would go up to Jess pretending to be modeling agents just so they could take pictures with her. 

Now this all had me rather fired up but it was nothing compared to when I found his ex’s Instagram. I scrolled through her pictures and to my shock, I found out that not only has he liked nearly every picture (including those after we started dating and until very recently) and not only does he follow her but she doesn’t follow him, but every single picture he had sent me of her was taken months before he said it was. The first picture he sent me over winter break was taken two months before that, and there were no rude comments under it or anything comparable to what he said happened. The pictures he sent me and my sister this summer (including the one where she was supposedly saying hi) were taken months ago, some of them 8 months ago, some of them 4 months ago, some of them 6. None were taken a month ago when he was supposedly in Europe with her. He had pulled random old pictures off her Instagram and sent them to me, passing them of as her being on vacation with him. Needless to say I was devastated and utterly confused as to why he would do this. I never brought it up to him because the brief long distance is difficult enough as it is and I would much rather confront him about this when I see him in person in a month.

What should I do? He’s clearly still hung up on her. I’m not even sure if she’s his ex or if he’s lying about that too since all I have to rely on is what he has said about her. She might just be a girl he was obsessed with in high school, given his behavior. I have no idea what to think, I love him and care about him so much and I know he feels the same. He's an amazing boyfriend besides the fact that he constantly tries to make me jealous and has gone to this extent to lie to me about this girl. This has hurt me so much and made the long distance even harder as it shattered my trust in him and I am constantly doubting him.

We live in different parts of the world but we share a common background. I recently came to my parents' house, where the girl currently lives, for the Christmas holidays.

We finally met on Dec 30th. It was one the best dates I have ever been to - we had a great time and I could clearly feel that we both were enjoying each other's companies. Once I came home, I gave her a courtesy call to make sure she had reached home safely. After that we have exchanged a few text messages. I didn't ask her about meeting me again in those texts. I didn't want to appear desperate so I did not text her too much either (about 3 text messages since then).

Yesterday, I noticed that she uploaded a picture with some guy - which sort of alarmed me. Now I am too uncomfortable with asking her who that guy is. She did mention during the date that she is not seeing anyone else and she broke up with her ex about 6 months ago. 

I really liked this girl. I won't say I'm in love with her but I do really like her and would like to spend more time with her while I'm still here and get to know her. 

Should I take the picture that she uploaded as a signal and assume that she is not interested in me? Or should I just ask her what's up with that picture?  I'm sure she was aware that I would see that picture - almost felt like she uploaded for me to see :/

Few hours ago, my decision was to just forget her and move on and not to embarrass myself by trying to talk to her. HOWEVER, I don't want to end with this mystery. How do I ask her and what should I ask her?  Although I am okay with letting her go, I secretly wish I could meet her again.

We also support each other a lot. I support her with her confidence and self-image issues, while she supports me with my anxiety issues. I was shocked that we'd made it like this, because her and I come from different philosophical backgrounds. 

Thing that concerns me is that on most of our dates, we don't have the 1 or 2 hour long conversations that most people talk about. In the beginning, we did have a phone conversation that lasted almost five hours! Now, though, We'll talk to each other, but most of the time we'll wind up ending the night in bed with a movie. Still: every night I've had with her has been amazing and so far I don't have any intention of leaving. 

We still text each other a lot. I do mean A LOT... and it's almost always about how much we miss each other and sometimes dips into dirty things... which I am 100% ok with and it always gives me something to look forward to.

One side of me is like: so what? Maybe not all couples have to be super talkative about everything. Another side is like: maybe all relationships are like this--this could be the average level of talkative-ness. Another side yet is like: it's your relationship--if you're happy and she's happy, who cares? But the last side of me is the scariest... If you two aren't always talking about something, that means the relationship is doomed and you don't really like each other.

12635,Relationships,2ttxry,"Hi All,


First of I would like to really thank anyone that reads this. I have tried to get advice from friends and family but it is inevitably always biased and I don't feel that I'm doing my girlfriend justice without been able to be objective so I really appreciate any advice I could get from you all.


We have both been in a loving relationship for 3 years now and honestly I adore this woman in a way I could never fully explain. She has made me and is the reason I wake up in the morning; she is my motivation personified and without her I would be a wreck of a man.


So with this said you might be wondering why we argue so often and I'm starting to constantly question it myself. It all began as most things do as small nagging thoughts and annoyances but as time has gone on and the prospect of sharing my entire life with this woman becomes more of a reality the small things have become big things and it's ruining us.


It seems every time we argue (admittedly most of the time its about sex or infidelity) my girlfriend either lies about what has happened or acts oblivious to her actions.


We have never slept with anyone else during our time together but we both had loose ends as single people when we met. I was a bartender so had been casually sleeping with people when we met and she was in a casual relationship with someone.


For the first month of our relationship she continued to text this guy about sex and meet ups; stringing him along as a backup which doesn't bother me (we all need a rebound just in case and we were only dating). The thing that annoyed me was that she would do this when we where spending time together under the guise of needing to speak to this dick who still had a dvd box set of her's and wouldn't give it back. the fact that she sent texts with rows of kisses made me a bit dubious and frankly how does one spend 6 hours a day for 5 weeks talking about a dvd? 


Now I'm not saying she's cheating on me I just want to set the scene.


About a month into our relationship we went into town for drinks with her family, she acted weird all night and towards the end was actually walking from bar to bar hand in hand with another man she had just met that night leaving me to walk awkwardly with her step dad. We finally got to the last pub and as I was sat next to the bar drinking a scotch and contemplating my leave whilst she was up against a wall with her hand on his waist whilst he stood leaned it stoking her hair and flirting. obviously we had an argument and she left with me. We got over it but it has always been something I remember and it has always hurt me that even after saying sorry she always clung on to the fact that because she never kissed or fucked him it wasn't cheating and at the end of the day she only did it because She was mad when she found texts on your phone from other woman...well yeah we where a month into the relationship and I had seen other woman before you! at least I was honest about it and had stopped texting them, up until that point she was still texting the above.



Well this is how all our arguments go down. Instead of just telling me  Yeah i was texting him about fucking especially now at the three year mark (as it has come up once or twice) when it makes no odds to our relationship, she insists on lying about it or acting oblivious as if she cant remember and its the same with the man at the bar, after 3 years she still can't admit she did it with out adding things like...it's not like I fucked him or just plain it didn't happen that way or if you didn't like it you should have said something which annoys me because in my eyes it shows that she doesn't have any respect for the fact that it hurt me and that she still doesn't really see anything wrong with what she did even if she does have to say sorry.


Now yesterday was a big argument and I feel bad for some of the things I said once the conversation had just dissolved into interrupting each other and slagging the other one off. She came back from work and all day I was thinking about fucking her, like I was really full of energy. The second she got through the door I pulled her into my arms and took her upstairs, I told her about the fact that I had fantasized about her all day and explained what I wanted to do, she seemed to reciprocate my feelings but every time I got hot and bothered she would put her head on my chest and just sit there cuddling. This happened for an hour; she would kiss me get me hot then stop and cuddle (or I would kiss her). After all this I mentioned that we where late for an appointment to see someone and she bounced out of bed and got dressed super quick almost relived about the fact that she had fended of my advances.


Now this got me pretty upset because it's happened a lot lately, Don't get me wrong we have sex often enough it just seems like half the time if I make the move she just gets me hot and then stops, and I get to the point where I'm sick of initiating just to be played with. I decided I would ask her what the problem was and that if she didn't want sex could she please just tell me because at the moment it feels like she's just using my lust to tease me and that it wasn't fair to play that game; all I got was the ever present almost scripted -


Pause 1,2,3
I'm sorry 
followed by the usual dumb act that is really starting to get to me  
I didn't realize you wanted sex or whats wrong with me just wanting to cuddle?


....well first off I had actually told you in plain English I wanted to get intimate and secondly there's nothing wrong with wanting to cuddle if I know it's not going anywhere but what she's doing is leading me on; Right?


She doesn't see a difference and say's that if she had said she wasn't in the mood I would have forced the issue even though this almost never happens. I say almost - don't want to lie, in three years I must have forced the issue a on occasion, it's not as if I can say I've never gone 


I'm sure I could get you in the mood ;]


But its a case of it been 3% of the time verses 3 years of straight up -


OK Hun fair enough no worries, so how was your day then... 


Not once have I have forced sex, what would be the point I don't want to feel like I've badgered someone into intimacy that takes everything I want out of it away. I want to feel like there doing it because they enjoy it.


I know I'm rambling but I can't think of a better way of explaining it. Yes it's a small thing and yes she said sorry straight of the bat but I don't want her to just say sorry because its always the same like she's been given her Que and she's just saying it to shut me up. I'll try and explain what hurt me. She says sorry and then immediately follows it up with an explanation as to why she's not accountable or that she didn't realize and if I don't accept that then ultimately it's my fault anyway. If I get angry and tell her apologies shouldn't end with and explanation that nulls them she cries and then I feel like a bad person. 


So in short after something that could have been a quick conversation we end up having the same old argument, the only argument we ever really have  - 


I said sorry 
yeah but you don't even know why you said sorry
I do know why and genuinely I am sorry but here's why it's not my fault and I'm not accountable


So long story short, its not the sex or the stuff at the start of our relationship that's bothering me it's the fact that it's always the same argument over and over and if i'm tired of it now what will it be like in another 3 years. I feel as if even though we always make up I can never really get over anything because I never really get real apologies and it just makes each subsequent argument that much worse. I need to solve it but at this point I can't tell whether she is been manipulative or if I'm a narcissist and just been pedantic.

12636,Breakups,2cgaq5,"Sorry if I screwed up that title at all, I'm not on here much. 

So my girlfriend was away on vacation this past week and just told me that last night she kissed another guy. Basically right now I'm feeling numb. Trying not to think about it too much. Very surprised, but also feeling like maybe I shouldn't be for a couple of reasons. 

Anyways, she was on the 6 hour car ride home when she texted me we gotta talk. Basically she wanted to tell me in person, but I pestered her to just tell me through text because I wasn't going to be seeing her for a few hours. We've discussed it a bit through text, mostly her saying sorry, thank you for being so good to her, she's resigned herself to me breaking up with her blah blah blah.

Anyways, I'm not sure *what* my next move is (likely breaking up with her, but admittedly I'm conflicted), but I'm sure that I want to discuss it in person. However, this brings up the problem of where we can discuss this. Definitely not her place because her family is there and lord knows I don't want to deal with them anymore, probably not my place because my family is here, plus its where we always used to hang out and do all sorts of promiscuous things that I definitely don't want to be doing with her instead of discussing things. 

My first thought was that we could meet for lunch somewhere and talk about it in sort of a neutral place. I was even thinking of doing a restaurant near her place so that I wouldn't feel obligated to invite her back with me. Only problem is that I know when we discuss this she is going to **cry**. She already cries a lot, even over minor stuff, and even though I'm kind of disgusted with her right now, she obviously regrets this and is going to be crying a ton when we talk about this. 

Basically my concern is that I don't want to be in a public place eating lunch while a vulnerable looking girl cries unconsolably across from me. For one thing, onlookers could get a wrong idea. For another thing, I don't want to have to console her. I don't feel I owe her that anymore. 

So these are the options as I see it right now, from least to most likely to happen:

*Her Place:* **LOL FUCK THAT**

*Phone:* At least then we could both be in private and I wouldn't have to worry about junior getting any wrong ideas and muddling the situation further. I'd much rather do it in person.

*My Place:* My family is here and I already told them she cheated on me. I don't want to put them through that awkwardness, and also if we found ourself in private, like I've mentioned, I don't want to cave in to any sort of physical intimacy I know I would regret. 

*Starbucks/Sandwich Shop:* No accidental intimacy, no awkward families, neutral place, but onlookers would probably misunderstand crying lady.

So... those options don't look great to me. I've also considered waiting it out a while so that she won't be as likely to cry, but I don't think she's gonna start feeling any better about it at least until we talk it over so that's probably useless. Also I just want to get it over with. 

Looking for any advice or further suggestions on this. Also I've never been cheated on or broken up with so any advice on that would be nice. A shitty thing is that we're both going off to college late next month and were planning on a clean, mutual breakup. She couldn't even last that long. 

Also, I know I'm young but this was a pretty long term relationship that we both put a lot of effort into, especially regarding trust and communication... So... This hurts. Thanks in advance.

12637,Relationships,246dme,"TL:DR: Opened relationship of 5 years, boyfriend lying about interactions with people and keeping secrets. Unsure about future. 

I (F 24) in a relationship of 5 years with my boyfriend (M 25) am in a weird place, and I don’t have anyone to talk about it with. I am having trouble running it all through my mind in a sensible way so I figured I would write it down even if it ends up being a bunch of nonsensical ramblings and no one reads it, at least it will be out there.

My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. Over a year and a half ago we had a super rough area and almost broke up, we went to couples counseling and worked through some issues. It was a few months later that I decided I wanted to join the military and started getting in shape and working towards that goal. Problem is as I started thinking about the future and what being in the military meant I thought my boyfriend and I’s relationship would probably end when I went to OCS because it would be such a long time with such little contact and he has a high libido so I thought it wouldn’t be fair to ask him to remain in a monogamous long distance relationship. Because of this train of thought it caused me to have really non-committal wording when talking about our future and ‘us’.

 I have known I was bisexual since before I met my boyfriend and have posed opening our relationship a few times through the history of our relationship so that I could be with women and he could fulfill his sexual wishes when I was not up for it as his libido is much higher than mine. He was always ‘not ready’ for an open relationship and thought he couldn’t handle it. That changed in December when he took a trip to see some internet friends. He visited them for a week, and when he got back he asked me if we could open the relationship because he had come to realize he was bi and thought it was a good idea now. I was fine with it, as I had offered it before, I was slightly wary as it was only once he had now met some people who were really straightforward and blunt about wanting to have sex with him. 

I knew he wanted to explore his sexuality, as do I, so I was very accepting of his wanting to open the relationship. I have also been fully open to him having sex with other women because I know I do not always fulfill his sexual needs as we for a long time had opposing work schedules and I had enough stress that it kinda killed my sex drive for a while. I learned later on after a party we attended that he got really drunk at (I went home from because I had work the next morning and the hosts said he could crash there since he didn’t want to leave when I did) that he expressed to people at the party that he was hurt that I was so ok with opening the relationship, that he took that as me not being terribly committed to the relationship. 

 I talked to him about it and how he shouldn’t have been surprised as I had asked about opening it on multiple occasions before. He said he understood and it was just drunk talk. Well a few nights later he went to dinner with an old friend and told him we had opened our relationship and stuff, when he got home he told me that that friend had apparently told another friend about our relationship opening and she had texted him asking if she had a shot with him and everything. Again, I was fine with this as I don’t hold a huge amount of meaning to sex, I think it can mean a lot, but that it can also just be a physical thing. Well since then he has had quite a few people that he texts and talks to about having sex with them and getting with them.

In March he visited the internet friends again, he went down figuring he would have sex with two of the three friends and that the third was a possibility, but not a certainty like the other two. Well this is where things, from my view, started to go haywire. On this trip he slept with all three of the friends which was not an issue for me at all until later. I was happy he was getting to have new sexual experiences and feel highly desired sexually as I know he has some issues with his ego. Well, while he was gone he didn’t talk to me much, which was weird because every other time he has gone on a trip or I have gone on a trip we call or text each other every night to say how our day was and just check in with each other and see how we are doing. I tried to brush it off as him just being busy with his good friends and there being a time difference. 

Well, when he got back from the trip things were bad. I picked him up from the airport with a friend of mine because the airport is a two hour drive away and I didn't want to make the drive alone because it is boring and I always have trouble staying awake if I do the drive alone. Well, after picking him up he was not as affectionate as he usually is which made me instantly think there was something on his mind. I knew there was something really wrong though when on the two hour drive home he didn't talk to me and he wouldn't hold my hand, which he always does on road trips, he instead spent the two hours texting other people and staring out the window.

 I wanted to have a talk with him when we got home, but I had to be up for work in less than six hours, so I figured I could wait until the next evening when we would have time. Well the talk didn’t happen the next night, because he spent the night talking to his friends on Skype and I was too much of a pussy to interrupt and say we needed to talk. This happened a couple nights in a row (I am really non-confrontational). I did try to make plans with him to spend time together which he agreed to saying a friend of his would like to have dinner with him, but he would rather spend the evening with me. Well when the evening actually came, he decided ‘last minute’ that he really should spend time with his friend. So he went out with his friend and didn’t get home until after I was asleep. 

It was after he left for the night with his friend that I sat at his computer to watch shows on hulu. On his desk was a letter from his brother who was in bootcamp at the time so they were only communicating through letters. Well I looked at the letter because my boyfriend had talked about how their letters mostly consisted of talking about things that gave them nostalgia and talking about their childhood. It turned out a part of the letter was a response to my boyfriend talking to his brother about how he was developing feelings for someone else. I know it is snooping, but it got me really worried, so I looked up the letter my boyfriend wrote that this would be a response to. 

Well the letter in question talked about how great sex was with the people he visited, how he wasn’t sure he and I would be together after we move, that he thinks I am not terribly invested in the relationship and that he has developed feelings for the female friend that he went down to see and slept with. Now to be fair, before his first trip down he had told me he had a crush on her, but after he got back from the first trip he said that he didn’t anymore because he realized ‘she was kinda dumb’. Which was apparently a lie. He also in the letter described that the sex with her was ‘the best he ever had’. 

Now I should add that when we opened our relationship we made the rules that we had to be safe, always wear protection and that we had to have full disclosure of everyone we slept with and if either of us asked questions we had to answer. 

Well after reading the letter I spent a day wallowing in my own misery before I confronted him about it. We had a huge blow out talk about how he didn’t think I was committed to the relationship and how he thought I was just going to break up with him when we moved apart and that he felt like the relationship was one sided and he did all the work in the relationship. It was during this talk that he accused me of never having talked about our relationship with any kind of committal language saying that we would be together for a long time or that I wanted to be with him for a long time. Well, it was about a week before his second trip to seeing the internet friends that I had actually ordered a ring for him and was going to propose to him. 

One thing that should probably be said as a history of our relationship and me is that when we went to counseling, one of our main issues, is that I don’t say things out loud very much. I express my feelings by doing things for people, doing favors like making him dinner, buying him something he needs but doesn’t want to buy himself, that kind of thing. I have worked on it since our couple’s therapy, but I still have issue with it and don’t express my feelings verbally very well and try not to be confrontational. He knows this is an issue for me and was touched that I had planned on proposing. The ring actually arrived the day after our big blow out and I showed it to him and he wears it and says he wants to marry me and be with me, but I am not so sure anymore.

12638,Breakups,2cer41,"So my bf and I have been together for only a few months, but the entire time he has been really keen on the idea of moving things forward, and he told me I am the kind of girl he wants to marry. I should also add I am a visitor to his country and in order for me to stay after 2015 we need to get a de facto visa (live together for a year, etc.) He brought this up after the first month or so and was very confident in doing it (yes, its fast but we had 6 months before we had to make the decision). He even brought up marriage if we couldn't go the de facto route, and repeatedly told me he used to be afraid of commitment but he wasn't at all with me and that I was his perfect girl. Everything about taking the next step was his idea, and he was so confident in it. It seemed a little fast to me, but his confidence was able to eventually win me over.

At the beginning he treated me like gold, I met his family and friends, and we spent lots of time together. But over the past week or so he became very sarcastic and saying rude comments towards me, but brushed them off as his personality. He still continued to talk about the plan he had concocted for my new visa and our relationship's future, and he told me every day that he loves me. 

Then the other night he went out drinking with a friend and sends me a text message saying he wants to be alone and do his own thing, that he misses being able to do his own thing. He wouldn't speak to me on the phone, and every question I asked him was met with a completely rude one-or-two word answer. He said he wants to slow down and that he still loves me but it isn't enough. I still have not spoken to him in person. Why would he say he wants to slow down when everything about moving forward has been his own idea??

12640,Dating,1n18zs,"Hey guys, first time posting here, seems like I've found the right place so I'm just going to dive straight into this. I'm in university and two years ago a girl transferred into my class from the year above me. Noticing that she didn't know anyone I made an effort to befriend her and to integrate her into my class. From then on we've been really great friends and we get along so well. Now we're going to get into the tricky business..

3 years ago my one and only real relationship ended, it was the only time I've been in love, and it's the strongest I've ever felt towards someone, I've been single ever since simply because I've never come close to feeling the same to someone else, but this is starting to change. When that relationship ended I felt so drained/empty that I just became an emotional rock; hardly anything/anyone got through to me and I shielded myself from feeling exposed to someone but this girl is breaking through. 

See during the 2 years I've known this girl I was well aware she had a boyfriend and I made sure to keep my distance and didn't want to become anyway involved. But as I found out yesterday they broke up during summer (I didn't find out because I was away and we weren't chatting much). Ever since she told me I've found when we're around each other I feel that bit more infatuated by her, there's so much more physical contact (nothing sexual, just touching + very mild intimacy), which I don't know if you would call flirting, there's mess fighting, grabbing, footsie in lectures etc etc.. 

I don't know what do to. If these are signals I don't want to miss them. If there are no signals and she's just playing around (not in a bad way) I don't want to make the mistake of assuming these are signals when they're non-existent. I've suggested meeting up to watch some breaking bad marathons, go see films and she likes the idea of it. So am I being blind? Should I take this slow and let it play out? I don't want to live with regrets, I don't want to find out that she's met someone else and that I've ruined my chance to make a move (if there ever was one). 

Does anyone have any advice? Thank you so much :)

12642,Breakups,1kszs0,"First, this is from my phone. I just moved into a new place, so no interwebs yet. Second, I'm cross posting from advice to see if anyone else has input. 


Backstory: I met this girl through work, we'll call her Kay. Kay and I were friends of sorts for a year or two, then one night after some drinking, we got into it hot and heavy. From there, it was sort of classic boy meets girl, girl boinks boy, boy and girl fall for each other. Anyways, we started dating and moved in together after about a year. Things sort of started going downhill shortly after, in my eyes at the time anyways.


Without going into to much detail, she always seemed to need my help with little things that I didn't think she should always need help with. Things like sending emails or making calls. It seems kind of silly in hindsight, but it got to me. And why it got to me was because I harbored so much stress from work. See, we're both grad students and that takes its toll.


So I got really stressed, she was stressed, and things went downhill. I wanted out. Not only that, but I was going away for the summer and not sure if I was coming back. I broke up with her in a really awful way, but because we lived together, we were forced to interact. Eventually, we got back into what was pretty much a relationship right until I left.


About a month or so into my summer internship, I started to de-stress and realize that I potentially made a huge mistake. It hit me like a ton of bricks as to how she must have felt through all of this. All I wanted to do was go back and comfort her and tell her how sorry and wrong I was. But I kept my mouth shut. I wasn't sure if it was regret, love, or selfishness. The anxiety got so bad that I couldn't sleep.


Now that I've returned, I apologized and tentatively, very tentatively, asked what she thought about this. We are still friends and she said it was better to get over me when I was gone and she doesn't want to go through that again. I get that, 100% no doubt, I get that. But maybe I made a huge mistake here. Maybe it's worth going back after here. Letting her know what a fool I was to let someone as beautiful and great as her be pushed aside for work and stress.


I don't know what to do. I'm so worried that I might be doing this simply because I'm alone, but I truly miss HER. I don't want to hurt her again, but on the other hand, I want to show her that I do love her and can raise above all this other crap now. And I'm certain I can do that. 


I'm going by to pick up some things tonight and I'm going got talk to her about it. I'm going to explain how I've felt and how I feel, and see if she might want for take things slow and try again. So, convince me that I'm either an idiot or that it's worth a shot. 


tldr: Met girl, fell in love with girl, lived with girl, shoulder way too much stress which caused me to break up with girl. Think I made a huge mistake and going to ask girl to give me a chance to show her that's the case.

When she broke up with me, she said that I wasn't the same with her. Well, in that point she was right, i don't be the same with anyone until i got sick. But what she said was only bulshit. First at all she was needing  to move out to another city and she was interested in another guy. 


So i only said her: it's ok by me, get out of here, go straight home or wherever  you want, don't call me more, talk or come back.

We broke up about a year ago (after a long period of being on/off) and before that were dating for about 2 years. Since we spent so much time together and have a lot of common interests, we decided to try to stay friends (occasional friends with benefits) which has mostly worked pretty well; we see each other during college vacations, as we're at different colleges, and have helped each other through a lot of personal problems. A couple of months ago he suggested getting back together and I turned him down, but things seem to have gone back to normal friendship since then.


However, about a week ago we had a very big argument and he doesn't seem to want to be my friend anymore. Background information: a while ago I read about a website where girls can find 'sugar daddies' to provide them with an allowance, shopping, etc. in exchange for some kind of relationship. I recently decided to look into this because although I have some savings, I didn't see a problem with the idea (or at least finding out more about it) and it would be useful to have some more money for travelling during the vacations, living expenses at college and maybe even building up my savings. I haven't gone through with anything yet but I've skyped and chatted with a few guys who seem nice and not too far away from me in age and am considering meeting up with them (I have a number of safety measures in mind).


I haven't told my mum yet, I don't want to make her worry especially when I haven't even really done anything yet. I told a few of my female friends and none of them saw a problem with it as long as I was careful to be safe. I usually tell my ex everything so one night I mentioned that I was chatting with a guy I met through the website and explained what it was. My ex reacted VERY badly, saying he was judging me and that I was a whore (or words to that effect) even though I told him I hadn't and wouldn't have sex with any guy I wouldn't be interested in if money wasn't involved. Besides, the guys I was talking to said they only wanted to meet for dates for some company when they were working away from home. He then said he had nothing more to say to me and stopped talking to me completely.


That was about a week ago, and last night we started texting (I was quite drunk but I'm not sure if he was). I brought up the issue again and he still had the same opinion and said it was 'weird as fuck' that he couldn't believe I was resorting to that, that I had changed and that all I did anymore was 'stupid shit'. He then blocked me on facebook, snapchat, etc.-- everything but whatsapp. 


It felt terrible both times being told those things by someone I used to love and still really care about. But I'm unsure whether he actually has a point because I can honestly say that before that I had no problems with the idea of having an 'arrangement' like that with a guy. It didn't feel like I was 'resorting' to anything-- I don't need money THAT badly-- just meeting guys I like and in exchange getting money to make college go a little more smoothly and be able to afford to travel and have experiences I wouldn't otherwise be able to. 


I doubt he'd talk to me again, at least not for a while, even if I did tell him he was right and stop what I'm doing. But he felt so strongly about it, and he was such a good friend of mine, it made me wonder if I actually am making a bad decision. I don't really see, though, why he would stop being friends with me for something which doesn't hurt him, me, or anyone else (so far as I can see), even if it does go against his morals (I had no idea up until now that he felt this way).


TL;DR: My ex-boyfriend and best friend judged me for what he considered a poor decision, insulted me and stopped talking to me when he found out I was considering finding a sugar daddy for some extra money. Should I trust my own judgement or listen to him?

12645,Relationships,1vkzwa,"Ok so over the past month or two I have come to the conclusion that guys and girls are unable to be friends. I now believe that friendship between the two is an unofficial type of dating with zero pressure. You get to know each other so well until one if not both develop feelings for one another. This is how the friend zone is developed as one party becomes complacent with the friendship while the other wants more. Here is how I've come to this conclusion:


Over the last summer I became close with two girls. One I dated and one I became best friends with. These two girls were best friends until they had a falling out and now my best friend refuses to talk to the girl I dated. Now over the summer we all were in the same friend group and hung out a lot. I dated this girl for a little over two months and it was awesome. It was my first real relationship and we had so much in common and had so much passion for each other. She eventually called it off as it was going to be my first year in college in she stated, being a year older than me, that she understood what happens in college and doesn't believe a relationship would work. I was willing to give everything to her but it just didn't work out. 


Now during this time I became really close with my best friend. We talked about everything and she was one of the only people I know that I could tell anything to. Now we go off to college and we text everyday with the occasional call mixed in. I went to visit her at school and learned a lot. Now her roommate kept badgering me about if I liked my best friend when she wasn't there. I kept saying no cause at the time I didn't. I also met this boy who she's obsessed with but he has a girlfriend. She has told me that she would do anything with him but not while he has a girlfriend. 


Now I go back to school and realize I have feelings for my best friend. These feel very different than with any other girl as I have a deep desire to care for her over just wanting sex from her. I realize just how much I care about her and want her. We get back for winter break and I tell her I have no feelings for my ex, which I didn't, and she tells me she doesn't want to talk to her because she hates her now. 


Now we go into the city with two of her friends for the day. Her and I hang out about an hour or two alone which was a perfect opportunity to tell her I liked her but I just didn't and I regret it. A few days went by and  I didn't know when I would see her so I decided to tell her over text which was stupid I know. She seemed a bit surprised but was very unclear about it. She said she needed time to think and we should talk about it later. Now the whole break was confusing. 


Her roommate was having people over her house for New Years and they kept pushing for me to come but I could not cause of my parents. I really wanted to and told her but it just did not work out. Then she was going into the city with friends and invited me. It turned out to be three couples and then her and I. Her roommate was there and kept badgering me about it. I was a bit mad over this as I felt like I was under pressure to do something but confused at the same time as I had no idea if I was supposed to make a move.


The next day I texted her saying we needed to talk and suggested an idea which she agreed to which was to meet somewhere after I got out of work. I text her when I got out and found out she went with her family to the place we were going to meet. I was a bit upset cause she knew I suggested it but she still went with her family. I felt like she was avoiding the conversation as she had stated she is not comfortable with these types of talks. I push for us to meet up for the entire week and we finally set up a time. 


We met and she was a bit unclear over what she wanted. I told her straight up that I cared for her and would date her and do everything I could to make it work. She said she liked to go with the flow and did not seem too fond of a relationship right now. We talked for a long time and she said she liked me but liked being single and going with the flow.


I said that is fine cause I can not force her into a relationship and we parted ways. She texted me an hour or two later with a long text saying she was glad I was honest with her. She said that she would act the same but she understood if I was unable to. She said we are friends and nothing more and she was glad we were back to normal.


Now things are not back to normal. I refuse to be friends with her or any other girl. I want her so badly and have realized that if anything happens between that guy who has a girlfriend and her I will lose it. 


What is also strange is that this situation has caused me to want my ex. It is strange cause I feel like it would work cause we did not end on bad terms and we had so much in common. I want the passion we had back during the summer. I also feel bad for her cause I feel most people abandoned her when she was going through a rough time. I feel like people do not understand her (even I do not) and she is afraid to open up to anyone. I want to help her and be with her but I also want my best friend so badly. I do not know if the feelings for my ex are just because of my current situation or something else. However I truly know that I want to date my best friend and would do just about anything to have her. I wish these feelings came a year or two later so she would be more open to the idea of a relationship. 


Now I'm not sure how to play this out. Texting with my best friend has become strange and I do not know how to handle it. I want to keep in contact with my ex because I want to help her and support her. I know if my best friend does anything with the guy that I will try and get with my ex. What also makes me nervous is that I feel like I will lose it eventually and just go out and look for one night stands when I am not like that and do not want that. 


I just need some advice over how to handle my best friend and what people think would be the best way to try to win her over. I am not ready to take no for an answer from her and I am willing to take steps to show her how much I care about her. I am just not sure how to do so at this point. 


I also could use some above over how to handle my ex. I want to support her but am not sure if I want to be with her. I want to talk to her and get her to open up but I do not want to lead her on cause I know I want my best friend. I just am not sure of how to handle her. 


Lastly I would like people's opinions on whether guys and girls can be friends. After developing feelings for 2+ girls who were my friends, I have began to realize that I am unable to have girls who are friends. I obviously like them as I choose to be around them it's just for whatever reason I choose not to make a move and try to date them. I eventually come around and realize that I want to date them and try to but end up in such a complicated situation. This is why I am strongly considering only having guy friends and never considering a girl to be my friend until I have found the girl I will spend the rest of my life with.

12647,Relationships,1ivdwe,"My boyfriend has told me in the past that I'm the one and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. But we have had some problems in the last 5 months, so we hadn't really been consistently happy in awhile. That is, until this month, which has been great again. I feel like we are on the right track to having the same amazing relationship we did before. Based on him telling me I'm the one, I've always assumed that those 5 months were just a rough patch, and that our true relationship was just waiting to re-emerge. And it has started to, which is really encouraging.

I'm moving to a new apartment on August 1, and I asked him if he would want to move in there with me one year from now. At that point we'll have been together almost two and a half years. His response was, I don't know. I don't want to guarantee that. I don't want to commit to something and then back out. I then asked if he could even say it was a possibility, and he still said he didn't know.

On one hand I understand his response. Because of the shakiness of the five months before this one, he still doesn't know if things are good enough to live together. On the other I was really embarrassed for even suggesting it, and after he left I cried. It wasn't like I was suggesting now - just a year from now. I guess people don't like to plan that far in the future... but it wasn't a definite plan. It wasn't even a conversation I intended on having, it was just an excited thought I threw out while we were looking at pictures of my new place. 

I'm sort of crushed. And I hate to admit that it bothers me that I can't bring this up again without looking needy and stupid. I have to wait to take this step until he asks me. I don't like that this seems out of my control now. I wish I never would have asked. 

The thing that bothers me the most is I chose a job in this city for him when I could have picked other places that I would rather live, based on the fact that I thought this relationship was the one and that I would do anything make sure we were together. So after I've gone out of my way to be with him, it stings to hear that he can't even entertain the idea of possibly living together in one year. Ultimately I guess I'm more invested in this than he is, and that is painful.

I have a heavy heart right now about our relationship. I would really appreciate some words/guidance on how I can try to get past this and not make it such a catastrophe.

On that note, I'll start. My boyfriend and I have been together since last September, and had been dating since the March before. I'm currently a junior in college, and he graduated May 2013. The majority of our relationship has been long distance. It's not the best situation, but we are not terribly far from one another and have so far made the best of it.

We text daily and call/skype every now and then, but, of course, it's not the same as seeing each other in person. We know each other on a deeper level than I know my friends, and I feel comfortable with him. Still, I feel as though something is missing, and I can't tell if that something would be fixed if there were no distance, or if there is some other block in our relationship. 

This past Friday, I drank too much and ended up hooking up with one of my best friends at school. I cried immediately after and am upset about the situation, but he (let's call him Nate) has been understanding from what I can tell. I have yet to tell my boyfriend (let's say Mike), though I know I should. It's not the first time I've hooked up with a friend while drunk but, last time, Mike didn't take it as seriously because I'd hooked up with a female friend rather than a male and I don't identify as bisexual (I'm just a horny drunk). The reason I'm more hesitant about it this time is because Nate and I have history and I don't want Mike to be upset. The weekend of my first date with Mike I also went out with Nate, whom I'd had a crush on and vice versa. I'd decided quickly that I wanted to pursue things with Mike rather than Nate, and after awkwardly telling Nate this we are now good friends. We get along well these days, but back then he made it clear he was not a fan of Mike. 

I can't tell how I feel about the whole situation. I'd be lying if I said I'd never wondered what would've happened if I continued to date Nate either instead of or in addition to Mike. I worry that I'd been too quick to count out Nate simply because I was an inexperienced freshman looking for a fuck buddy. My relationship with Mike was heavily physical from the start, where Nate and I never even kissed (until this weekend that is). I don't want to throw away what I have with Mike just because I *might* still have a crush on Nate. On top of that, I don't know if I'd be as confused about it if Mike were still in the same city. To my hormones, Nate may just be the more convenient option. And, even if I did decide to pursue something with Nate, the months after I rejected him in favor of Mike were awkward and full of tension between us, so it's very likely he's not interested.

There's more to my relationship with Mike and friendship with Nate, of course, but I just wanted to type some of it out to help unscramble my brain. Also, for context, Mike and I have been in a monogamous relationship for the past year. When we first started dating, we'd both been seeing other people (including another friend of mine that Mike was incredibly jealous of). He's also my first boyfriend, so I'm kind of making up being a girlfriend as I go along.

Me and my girlfriend broke up the other day and i'm torn up inside. It was the best relationship i have ever had with somebody, and we are trying to make the breakup as painless for each other as we can. It is just so hard. Nothing went wrong, we just kind of fell out of love with each other, and one day realised that we had lost what we once had. I am struggling to tell people. She is my best friend and in the course of our relationship we have both lost some friends (long unrelated story) but have still been there for each other. I am at a loss for what to do. I feel I have no close friends to talk to anymore. I am mainly just struggling to let go, and I know that clinging on to what is no longer there is just destructive in the long run. We still want to be friends but i don't know how to manage it. It was the best relationship i could have ever imagined, she is beautiful inside and out and we built the relationship on being completely honest and open with each other. I'm not sure if i'll ever experience a love like this again.

12650,Relationships,2wiv5s,"A little background: This is the first relationship for both of us. We have been together for 2.5 years, live together and both are scientists working in the same research institution. This has worked well so far, and we have been able to create our own space, and have our own interests, etc. 

We are both applying to graduate school for next year - albeit in different fields - and this is where we have been running into a rocky place. Both of us got accepted to many programs, but only overlap at one school. Where you go to graduate school is obviously really important to where your career heads, so I have been thinking about the pros and cons of each school that accepted me, and the work I would be doing at each place. She is firmly putting our relationship ahead of everything else, and says she is only considering the school that we could both attend together (and presumably continue dating at). Conveniently, this is also her top choice, whereas I am still trying to figure out where it stands for me. 

This puts me in an tough situation, where the onus is on me to decide whether or not our relationship continues. There are a few wrinkles there as well, as she is really happy with our relationship, but there are a few things that bother me. None of them are deal breakers, I don't think, but she is kind of putting me in the position to choose whether we spend a significant chunk of time together, so I feel that I need to weigh them in. The main one is that our sex life is pretty lackluster. Not for lack of trying, but she has a very low libido, and doesn't want to try very often. It's something that I have talked to her about, and that she is taking more seriously, but it bothers me that it's still an issue. There is other smaller things, like her family we would be moving closer to, that give me pause, but overall I really adore her, and we work together well on a lot of levels. 

That is what is making this such a big decision; part of me is worried that I am locking myself into a relationship that I am not entirely happy in (she has let me know that if we decide to stay together, she wants to get married), and the other part is worried that I won't find someone that makes me as happy as she does. I feel rotten for being so selfish about my future, and I really don't want to upset her, but this decision has been eating at us for a while. I feel like it has been just as cathettic writing this out as any advice I might receive, but thanks in advance for any insight you have to give.

My GF of 1 year has been staying at my place now 70% of nights. She keeps telling me she wants me to stay at her place more often and I make an effort to do so on the weekends.

To give you an idea of the differences in apartments:

My apartment is a large completely renovated top floor with sky lights and a large living area.

Her bedroom is barely big enough to fit her bed and her and her roommate share a single small bathroom that looks dirty no matter how much you clean it.

_________________________

Now the problem here is that both of our leases are up soon and we talked about it and decided that we're not ready to move-in together (to not each have our own places).

My roommate and I are looking for a new apartment and the one that we're looking at is a huge townhouse (3 bedroom + den, huge deck, private back yard, large incredibly nice kitchen, gas started wood burning fireplace, the works).

My GF is going to law school and will be taking on a lot of debt and as such will most likely be in a small 1 bedroom / studio apartment again with older appliances, no counter space, limited closet space etc.

She wants us to be splitting time 50 / 50 between her place and mine but she still wants us to spend everynight together. I've told her that if she's not ready to fully move in together than I don't understand the desire to be spending every night together and that if she wants to come back for some hanky panky (or just cuddling) after hanging out in the evening she can come back to my place, or alternatively if we're hanging out near her place than I could go back to her place those nights, but that I don't necessarily need us to be at the same place every night if we're not living together.

She has told me she would never move in with a boy + his roommate so that when the time does come for us to move in together she wants it to just be the 2 of us. I'm okay with this but since we're not at that point yet, and because I'll be paying quite a bit for a very nice apartment, I would like to spend more than 50% of my nights there. If that's not going to happen, then I don't think I can justify paying for the place.

I dont know how to have this conversation with my girlfriend in a way that will make us both happy and in a way that doesn't come off as me saying, NO! I want you to just move in with me or we can see each other less often than every night.

Basically me and long term girlfriend split up over 2 months ago after seven and half years together. Still going through the motions and moving shit out of my house but we are still on speaking terms and determined remain friends (whatever that means.. I mean is it even possible?)..... However this isn't really the issue at hand though. What happened has happened and I'm determined to move on from this point of my life as is she so that's all good.

My main problem is there has been a girl who I've known as long as my ex-girlfriend from my old school days who I've ALWAYS liked but we were never exceptionally close or hang around in the same circles etc. 

One night this week I got slightly drunk and it inspired the confidence to send her some messages on Facebook. We talked, it was great, I mentioned the breakup and she seemed to sympathise with my suitation regarding the breakup however skimmed right over it and asked me basically straight up out for a drink sometime. 

Now it might sound like a bit of an overreaction but you have to bare in mind that even though I would probably talk to this girl if I saw her in the street I'm not very close or in any of her friendship circles so I was shocked, I didn't really know what to think, how to react etc. 

She is in a relationship currently with a guy I've never met before and I have no idea how that relationship is currently so internally I'm asking myself questions over and over about what is going on and what should my own reaction be.

Anyway, I said fuck it yeah lets meet up on a certain day and soon afterwards said day arrived. We met up alone and she was beautiful, I got butterflies in my stomach just walking up to her, it was ridiculous. I felt like I was at school again.

We went to get a drink together and we hit it off really.. talking about each other and getting to know each other.. it was going well..... like too well. Laughing at each others jokes when they weren't funny well and well fuck I don't know she was just beautiful. It's the old fucking cliche but I did feel like there was chemistry there and it didn't feel fake and it really hit me that this girl was just really wonderful.

But then we were joined with some other friends of hers which changed the topic of conversation completely. I guess I was annoyed by this and I think she looked annoyed, as well as she kept apologising to me for them being there. I genuinely didn't mind in the long run cause I actually had a really good night with everyone and we all went home our separate ways having a good night.

Yes OK so we could argue it's early days and maybe I'm jumping to huge conclusions about my feelings - but I did feel like there was something going on between that possibly implied the more then friends zone.. the body language and the way she reacted to me. Why would she ask me out for a drink on my own? We've barely spoken in possibly 5-6 years....

however on the flipside of all this, I'm quite confident  about myself that I'm NOT prepared to fuck up someone else's relationship and happiness...

So what the fuck do I do now?

Do I just act Mr. Casual in the friendzone and just carry on the way I have been doing, or do I tell her how I feel about her? I feel like I'm fucking 15 again or something, it is stupid situation.

My boyfriend and I have been together for just short of 7 months now. He has a 4 year old boy and a 9 month old boy. He just confirmed that the 9 month old is actually his after known incidents of infidelity on her part at the time of conception. The baby was conceived just before they split up and their divorce will be final in the next month. He will have visitation/partial custody (not sure what the legal terms here are)  of the 4 year old and will be seeing him for two days ever week or every other week depending on the court decision. 

About us... 

In our time together we have become close incredibly fast. Both of our previous relationships prevented us from talking about our feelings or having any ability to improve ourselves without being held back. That being said we were both ready to be able to talk and trust. I would say, without a doubt, that this is the healthiest, most supportive relationship I have ever been in. We rarely get angry at each other and when we do, are able to resolve our issues quickly and calmly. We both agree that we have never been able to be more open and honest with anyone else.  

The current situation... 

As his divorce becomes finalized he will be seeing his 4 year old son more often and wants me to meet him when I'm ready. The child's mom lives with her boyfriend and the boy has been asking his dad if he has a girlfriend like mommy has a boyfriend. The child seems very eager to meet me because he understands that I make his daddy happy. I had reservations about meeting him and still am pretty terrified even though I know that he is a really good kid. He's not a trouble maker and doesn't need constant instruction. By all accounts he is very easy going. 

I don't have experience with children and am scared to have this responsibility. My boyfriend and I have discussed this at length and I am much more comfortable now than I was a few months ago. He has assured me that I can wait until I'm ready (how will I know that?) and that my role/responsibility will be only to the extent I want it to be.

12656,Breakups,29xrfo,"**History:** After my fiancee (together two years) was killed by a drunk driver in October 2009, I spiraled into a dark depression full of drug abuse and lonely self-harm. I tried to join the military in August of 2010, just wanting someone or something to take control, but some of the places I'd travelled combined with my history of arrests and drug offences made that impossible. So I contacted my family (no parents, just an amazing grandfather, lots of aunts and uncles, and a brother) after being gone for four years and they helped me re-enroll in university. But by November I was drinking my way into being kicked out (again) and ultimately tried to commit suicide. My brother and the rest of my family saved me and in my recovery, I discovered (through a multitude of doctors) I was (and always had been) bipolar and narcoleptic.

**Meeting:** In Fall 2011, with treatment and a new outlook on life, I returned to university and killed it. I was a new person, but it took me some time to start dating again. I met Madison through OkCupid in April of 2012 and we immediately hit it off. The sex and our chemistry were amazing - we spent a week in bed together and she moved in shortly after. Madison became a pillar for me in dealing with bipolar, narcolepsy, and other issues. For the first time in years, I felt hopeful of the future. It wasn't all roses, but she kept me alive...

**Last year:** By May 2013, my career and life were skyrocketing. I had more job offers than I knew what to do with, had started my own company, and couldn't seem to shake (or didn't want to) a super-long manic period. That summer changed my outlook on my own future, but at the expense of spending less time caring about Madison. I graduated this past December and immediately started working for a great company, travelling quite a bit and depending on Madison less and less.

**Now:** We moved into a newer and much nicer apartment in April and Madison graduated in May. Her lack of ambition or self-enthusiasm has been the core of many of our arguments, something we do more often than not. Sex has become a chore for me, something I perform just to keep her happy. The amount of attention she wants is just not something I'm willing to give. She (finally) got a job offer that requires her to move four hours away and I have no intention of following. We both know this breakup is coming, but neither one of us seems to have the courage to make it so.


**Today:** Madison has been away for a week and I've been out of sorts. Finally today, I decided it was over. I've been boxing up all her things, putting them in her car, and plan to remove all traces of her from my life before she returns on Tuesday. She has a place nearby to stay and already planned on moving back with family next month for her job. What I don't know... is how to tell her. I've promised to pick her up from the airport on Tuesday, but she won't be spending the night here...

Madison is an extraordinary girlfriend in many ways, but I just don't have the time or patience to give her the attention she wants or deserves. I need to focus on myself, my career and health, without distraction. I still care for her, but I don't love her any longer.

So I met my now ex off of OKCupid in August of this year. We hit it off surprisingly well; sex was great right off the bat, we had a lot in common, we made each other laugh, etc.


We continued to date, and became official in October. We spent tons of time together, going out for dinner, meeting her and my friends/family. We even had a good talk of how our dating/blooming relationship seemed different from others we had, and that a spark was really there. I was getting ready to really settle with her.


In November, she had to go on a business trip in Ottawa and was gone for a week. The next week she was on a trip to Jamaica to see family. We managed to stay in touch by phone and Skype, and had good, lengthy conversations just about everything, and we seemed fine. We even planned a trip to see her friends in the States for this past weekend.


I was sick the following week and we were unable to see each other, but again everything seemed okay.


This past weekend, we went out to see some of her friends in the US. I got along well with her friends; we saw a hockey game together, took in some sights etc.  She was a little less affectionate, but she usually acts like that if we are in a group of friends, so no radars went off there for me.


I come home after work today, we had the talk over the phone. She said she just doesn't feel the same way she did at the beginning and can't explain it. She claims there was nothing I did during the trip. I prodded her a bit more, and she said  I got used to the 'single' feeling while we were apart for November and we are at different stages in our lives, both seemingly vague answers. I tried to press for more specifics, but nothing.


She told me she spoke at length about it with her roommates(both of whom have track records of picking apathetic, selfish, generally abusive boyfriends) and came to this decision. 

I feel the roomies put some pressure on her, because it just doesn't feel right how abruptly this ended. Could it be because I'm still establishing my legal career? I'm going to college for paralegal studies PT, working FT as a legal assistant, I will make it. Is it because I don't have that amazing job yet, and I can't give her a nice house? I felt really close with her, and things were going so well. It just seems it came out of nowhere, and she didn't seem genuine when she was saying what she was saying.

12661,Dating,3cy88t,"I've known this girl for a while now, and it's only fairly recently that I've actually started to take an interest in her. A few weeks ago we started messaging on a fairly regular basis, and I recently asked her if she wanted to meet up for a meal/movie sometime. This is where the problem occurred.

She said okay, but she wants to wait until she finishes work (she works at a school, which breaks up for the summer in two weeks). The thing is, I'm not sure I could cope with waiting that amount of time without doing something stupid. A couple of times before I've gotten myself worked up into a sort of frenzied state where I feel I absolutely have to tell them how I feel about them, often without any direction, sort of like I really really like you.This has never gone well for me, so obviously I'm trying to avoid it.

What I don't know is how I should approach the situation. I want to tell her that I'm really into her, but I also don't want to pressure her; she clearly had a reason for wanting to wait two week, either because she's not all that into me or because she legitimately feels she couldn't fit it into her schedule.

First of all i would like to say that my overall grammar use isn't all to great, i'm from belguim. 

Lets cut to the case.  
I'm in this very akward position with a girl, you may call her my crush.  We talk often online via chat because thats the only way we can talk to each other. We're both 2 very shy individuals. 
Whenever a fresh day starts i wake up with my goal being go up to her grow a pair and to start talking! I have good conversation in mind but then when i arrive at school... 

I arrive at school lessons start (she's not in any of my classes) 
The only times i really see her is between brakes. And she's almost always with friends, i just can't seem to rak up the nerve and go up to her and talk to face to face with her while she's with a group of friends seems wierd right? I'm always looking for perfect oppurtunities but i just can't seem to find one. The day passes and i haven't made any progress.


Now when i come home i start chatting with her. We have enough chat text to cover a whole book. But i just can't bare chatting on facebook anymore. I want to take things easy by first taking to her briefly and then asking her out. Would it be the wrong call to ask her out before i have approached her at school even tough we have chatted thogether for over a year now?

12666,Relationships,3d8xla,"This may be a long post, so buckle up.
Here's the current situation:

My girlfriend has been acting somewhat suspicious with checking her phone recently. She used to check it to where if I glanced over I could see what she was doing, usually nothing particularly interesting. (Should be noted I did not make a habit of this and usually just ask.) Recently, however, I've noticed that she has been putting effort into hiding it while I'm around, or just looking at notifications and ignoring them, which I thought was weird, but no big deal. Later on I was using her phone to post a snapchat of her (kind of like a message using mostly pictures, for the uninformed) and noticed that there were a couple guys she had been snapchatting an awful lot lately (this info shows up next to people's names when sending snaps). Number 1 I immediately recognized as her ex and number 2 I didn't recognize. I found it odd since she hadn't mentioned anything about either of them, so I asked. She said one of them was a coworker at her new job (who she pointed out was ginger in a tone that suggested she thought his ginger hair was unattractive, important later) and that her ex (who she has before said she still talks to infrequently since they are still on good terms) was asking about relationship advice. 

Then skip to a conversation about how I asked because she had been acting weird about it lately and she hadn't mentioned either of these guys before then. This led to her saying she was sorry for being so secretive and assured that both of them were just asking advice on relationships. She then (I'm assuming in an attempt to regain my trust she felt she had lost) promised she wasn't hiding anything and offered to let me check her messages. Well, I feel kind of shitty for admitting this, but I figured if she was willing to let me look, I may as well. This is a list of what I found:

1) her ex is now single

2) apparently she has been talking (messaging) him a lot more than she has me to the point where he asked how we were doing (relationship-wise) something along the lines of how are you and your bf doing? When do you guys hang out? We've talked every night this week lol to which she gave a vague answer and then said I was clingy. I find this weird because we've barely talked since she has been working all week. 

3) a guy from when we first started dating and obviously had a crush on her started messaging her again. It made me uncomfortable that she seemed to be humoring this guy and I let her know and she showed me it was mostly just basic conversation (ie how's your day going, etc.), but I did note he was obviously trying to impress her. Anyway, the recent conversation went like this: hey, this is ---. I'm so tired. What did you do to me lol what? I didn't do anything to you I know, I'm joking I know noticed you really wanted to kiss me yeah, I did, but didn't know if you wanted to lol after this she didn't say anything until the next day she apologized saying she fell asleep (not sure if true or not).

And finally 4) the supposedly unattractive ginger is listed in her contacts as Name The Attractive Ginger but I found not texts between them, and a single phone call (aside from all the snapchats).

The story she relayed to me about (3) is that she saw him at a funeral they both attended and he noticed him staring at her lips. She then gave him a ride home because he didn't have a car. I forgot to mention the ginger thing to her, she did say though, that she didn't want me to know about their problems since it was supposed to be on the DL and she doesn't want me advertising their problems. (which I still don't think justifies hiding that she was even talking to them)

Anyway, we talked for a while and I let her know it makes me uncomfortable that she didn't say anything along the lines of no, I'm not interested, I have a boyfriend, sorry. On top of it being a guy who i had previously let her know he makes me uncomfortable. And again with her talking to her ex, from what I read in their convo's he seems to be gauging whether or not she's interested and is getting (at least in his eyes) positive results. She says it's because she doesn't want to come off as harsh. Another thing that made me uncomfortable is the way she explained the kiss thing. She basically said she thought this guy was attractive and definitely would like to have kissed him, but, since we're in a relationship, she didn't. To be fair though, neither of us were completely sober during this conversation.

I honestly don't know what to think. Am I overreacting? May be worth noting this is my first relationship, so I'm new to this and her dog passed a day ago and she was very upset, so I really don't want to confront her again until she's not as shaken up. Sorry for the long post, any insight, input, etc. greatly appreciated.


Tl;dr: girlfriend acting suspicious with phone activities, come to find out she was hiding that she was messaging her ex, a coworker, and a guy who has had a crush on her for a while. This makes me very uncomfortable, but she refuses to be assertive due to not wanting to come off harshly.

12669,Breakups,3cwrq2,"So I've been on a few dates with this really cool girl over the last couple of weeks. She's not exactly what I would consider ideal in the looks department but incredibly sweet, caring, and cool. She's a gamer ( a big plus in my mind), works in a similar industry as I do, loves to go out and have fun at bars but is also cool with staying in and doing nothing (which matches me to a tee). 

I brought her to my friends 4th of July party and she really liked all my friends ( and vice versa). I was excited about the potential in this girl once I found out how well she fit in with my friend group. We are definitely sexually compatible as well, so things were going great in my head. And then we hung out last night and it got weird.

Her friends and my friends met up at a local pub last night for drinks and dancing. I was excited to see them all but by the time I got there (around 10:00pm) her and her friends were all wasted. Like, Woo-girl wasted (which considering they are all 21 isn't really a surprise but whatever).

Anyway we were kinda talking and dancing and having fun but she kept asking me what was wrong. When I kept telling her there was nothing she asked why I wasn't kissing her/hugging her/holding her hand/etc., (I should note now that I'm not the biggest PDA guy and we had never really done that stuff before last night). She would also come up to me and tell me that she really liked me a lot and the dance away to see her friends.

Now I'm not saying that I minded the attention from her, but I started to get a weird vibe about where she thought we were heading. I just got out of a long term thing and am not looking for another one, but up to this point we hadn't really had a conversation about it.

So we all went back to my place and her and I went to bed. While we were laying down she told me again how much she liked me and enjoyed being with me and (here's the reason for my post) I kind of blurted out that I didn't want anything long term. She really did not take that well, she started to tear up and say that it was Ok and that if I didn't want to see her it was fine by her.

I then spent the next like 30 minutes trying to awkwardly explain to her that it wasn't like I didn't like her, just that I didn't want a long term thing. I try to be as open and honest with people as possible and didn't want to lead her on or anything. I was just telling her how I felt about us.

She grabbed her friend, grabbed a cab, and left my apartment in tears. Now I feel like a complete asshole for telling her what I felt about the two of us. I guess my question is, did I do the right thing? I felt at the time like I was sort of ripping the Band-Aid off in a way. Like, I don't want to lead her on for a couple of months before telling her how I felt just so I can keep getting laid. I'm sad that it looks like its over between us but I'm not sure if I did the right thing or not. Please let me know what you think so I can avoid being a complete douchenozzle in the future.

12674,Dating,3b0ogg,"I recently started a casual relationship with a guy. We have more of a FWB type of relationship and have been seeing each other for about two months. We ended up having sex a couple of times and have talked a little bit about our sexual fantasies. During one of our conversations, we were talking about whether we watched porn and I mentioned that I sometimes enjoyed watching gay porn. He actually seemed very excited about that but we kind of left the conversation at that. 

A few days after our porn conversation, I left on a trip to New York for two weeks and we text each other during the time I was gone. The texts were normal and there were no problems. I got back from New York about two weeks ago and we hung out earlier this week. However, lately he seems to be getting really pushy for more intimacy and for a more serious relationship. I have made it clear that I want to keep our relationship casual and that I am not interested in anything serious with him.

However, today we hung out at my place for a little bit and before he left he handed me a USB drive and told me to take a look at it when I get a chance. That struck me as unusual but I looked at the USB drive anyway.

12675,Relationships,3a6xoe,"We have lots of times where we end up in arguments like these, and It's always a problem for me to realize who is at fault during them. An example would be this morning, where I mentioned that I would like to go to a park with her today. She asked which park, and I suggested a certain park which I believe is a really nice park, although she has told me before that she does not like that park.

 This would have been fine, if the reasons she had for disliking it weren't silly, in my opinion anyway. A few months ago, a dead body was found in that park, which is a big reason why she does not like going there. I can understand that, but I believe it's common sense to also understand that it is unlikely for that to happen again any time soon, and that she does not have to worry about it, considering that tons of people go to that park every day. She has also mentioned that she does not like the kind of people who go there, saying that they are reckless. I, however, have never experienced seeing people like this at the park, so I also believe it's common sense to realize that her experience is not an experience that often happens there, and she should not worry about it. 

I don't mention any of this to her, however, because I am aware that even if I do, her opinion won't change. She can be really stubborn like that. So I started to really question her about it because I really wanted to understand what was so bad about it, but she took it in a way where I was being annoying to her and she called me a child simply because I was trying to understand her point of view. Understandably, I realized that I WAS being annoying with the constant questioning of, Why don't you like the park? It's a nice park! you don't have to worry about it. But I still feel like the way she reacted to my annoyance was uncalled for. She started having a really bitchy attitude, and in response, I became visibly upset over it. This is where she starts complaining about the way my face looks as if I have no right to be upset over her bitchy attitude. I then told her that I don't think I would want to go to the park anymore if this is how it's going to be, she then said something along the lines of, then go to your house and do nothing there like a disgusting slob and that really hurt me.

 Whenever I confront her about the mean things she says to me she always tells me that she's kidding, but it feels like she just says that so she won't end up looking like an asshole.

12676,Relationships,3bjs09,"I guess our story is not unique. Our relationship has had problems from the start, mostly because we met at a time when my confidence and self-esteem were low, and he wanted the stability of a relationship without the work. However, there was something about him - he was just kind. And completely oblivious to his own issues. We clicked on many levels and started dating.


TBH he treated me horribly, and while I called a lot of it at the time, I stuck around. Cheating, lies, excessive drinking (and he's a mean drunk), you name it, it happened. In hindsight, the treatment was even worse. My view today is much harsher, probably because all my work on myself over the years has actually fixed my self-confidence and all the things that come with it. 


Fast forward to today, and at some point in the last few months, I had enough. I checked out. There have been times when I've *hated* him. I hate his drinking. I hate that I can't trust him when he's been drinking (which is all the time). I hate that our sex life is mediocre and that I have to do all the work (I never get an orgasm unless I take the reins). But on the other hand, every so often I see the guy who I know is hidden in there. He's kind, and he's generous, and he just wants everyone to be happy. Every so often I get a glimpse of that guy and I wonder how to get him back full-time.


But when we hit that point where I had enough, I wound up having an affair. Typical story: A guy signals interest. Guy is married too. I figured it was just fun flirting until he actively pursued me. I held off for a little while, assuming it would die down, but after a good pursuit cycle I wound up in bed with the guy. I don't feel overwhelmingly guilty, mostly because it lit a fire in me. I can do better. I can be happier. And honestly? I feel a little like I was owed this. I'm a horrible person.


Honestly, it was nice to have that whole interlude again. The period where you can't stop thinking of each other, etc etc yawn. We saw each other again once more and it definitely wasn't as good as the first time (typical). And now, the other guy is pulling back, which... is fine. It hurts, like all breakups do, but he doesn't live near me and I really can't imagine keeping an ongoing affair, well, going. Plus I can't keep using it as an escape from my marital problems. I reiterate: I'm a horrible person.


So now, back to marital boredom. Except something has changed. I finally, after a couple months, told my husband (who was basically checking out and telling everyone that we were going to get divorced) to just leave, if that's what he wanted. And that leverage seemed to be what brought us back together; things have been great in the intervening time. We're clicking in the bedroom again, on an emotional level outside the bedroom, everything. But I still feel like I'm missing something because I don't get the little satisfactions from him. He doesn't tell me I'm pretty or that he misses me. He doesn't do the little things that people in love do. So I now feel like we're old friends who have sex. And that's not what I want in a husband. I want the little things too. 


I'm in therapy to figure my shit out. Still a lot of work to do there.


Now what? It's not horrible. It's not good. It's certainly not stable. Should I tell him about the (ended) affair? Should I seriously consider divorce to pursue happiness? Should I ride out this wave to see if it'll last?

12677,Relationships,31nchu,"My wife (33/F) and I (29/M) together for 3 years, married for 6 months have always had some communication problems that we recognized but have not been able to work on very much. I feel like I'm at a point where I don't recongnize myself anymore in this relationship and I would like to invite some outside perspective. We met in Ethiopia when she came to visit her friend there. It was awesome! She ended up staying there for the first 2 years of our relationship. I had a good job and was able to support us both. Then she got pregnant and we decided that medical care was better where she was from so we decided to move to the USA. She moved first and I was supposed to follow as soon as I had my papers sorted. But in the middle of all of this planning one of the saddest most shocking thing I could have ever imagined happened. Our baby didn't make it. She passed away at birth. At this point the embassy fast tracked my paper work and I was able to be by my wife's side. This happened in June 2014. I have now been in the US for 10 months still grieving my daughter, unemployed and fighting my family to get their hands off of my marriage which they don't approve of for reasons that I think are absurd (race and religion). 

I am tryin to be very brief so very long story short it's been a lot to handle since I moved here and I am somehow trying to move on and get myself together. Trying to find a job, meet new friends build a new social life in a new country. My wife also started working and is now supporting us financially. The problem is I am starting to see a whole different side of her. She just doesn't want to talk about our relationship. I can only imagine what she must be going thru on her end but all we do for the few hours after she comes back from work is eat dinner in front of the tv and go to bed. We haven't had sex in over 3 months and the times we had sex was when she wanted to. I guess that is the least of our problems as I understand that we have to work on grieving our baby and reignite the emotional connection we had. I always try to start the real conversations and I am met with complete shut down. All She says is that she's doin fine. That's it. This Saturday she Shhhshed me cuz I talked in the middle of her favorite tv show. That's how sad this relationship is right now. Its so sad it's funny. 
I am so on edge and weed calms me down so I am smoking some now. I have been smokin on and off since 2008 and it has never been an issue in my life or career ( I have a masters degree and just started working on my second one in January, had really good jobs til I moved to the US, lived and travelled in Europe for 3 yrs). She now is demanding I stop smokin weed. She knows my relationship with weed and she was okay with it although she had here reservations. She says she has matured more and she doesn't want to deal with drugs at this point in her life. She avoids discussions about this and many other aspects of our relationship. She says she loves me but I just find her asking me to see things in her way and be someone that she wants me to be. I don't have much of a support system since my family has pretty much shut me out and I find myself feeling really depressed and at times very aggressive and angry towards her which is NOT who I am. Have I lost her? Am I trying too hard? Do I need to change to make this work? I want this to work and I will do whatever it takes to get thru to her and see that there are two people in this marriage and it's okay if we r different in some ways as long as we can find a middle ground.

So continuing from the last post, I have not seen anymore of the behavior I mentioned previously with her sneaking around and she has stopped seeking attention from the dating site or the wechat nearby, and has generally stopped talking to most of the old flames from those avenues. The friend I mentioned before, that I am familiar with, I don't feel threatened at all by and I don't see any problem with her keeping contact with him but not like I could do anything about anyway if I wanted to. This fellow and I aren't best friends, but he is close enough to respect me and knows she is dating me; she will vent to him about our relationship-- Thankfully he is a good friend, who I trust enough to handle this information, but some of the things he has told me she has said to her has really rubbed me the wrong way. So far I think I have handled it well, but here is the gist of what she had vented to him about when I was away for those couple days and how I addressed these complaints since I have returned:

* I am her 'little boyfriend' and that she endures me like taking care of a child
* I have spent too much time with her, or have been too clingy
* Penis is very small (wtf ...)
* She felt like she wanted to break up before I went back home, then followed it up with I plan on breaking up with him over the summer in china

Now these were all pretty shocking, in my mind because most of the complaints never actually existed as problems as far as I was aware:

* I have always carried myself as someone older than I am, she always commented on this and would say things like your mind is older than mine, you have the mind of an old man and I have a fulltime CS job that pays well enough to support both of us. I never whine, or complain about things, I always take things with a grain of salt (which maybe I should be with these complaints), I am always calm, patient, and respectful to others and the environment, my habits are on point, never play video games or drink too much, exercise daily, and keep a balance between my attention to work, her, the dog, and always clean up after myself no matter the situation.. Most importantly, I always lead her and push her to keep up with her piano practice. I don't see why she has any reason to feel like she is a mom, if anything I make her feel like a little girl.
* It is true we have spent nearly every day together, but this has *always* been at her request. I have gotten away for those couple days after insisting that I need to take care of things and that I would return when I was available-- This did not make her happy, she is always nervous whenever I mention leaving her or doing something without her. I approached this topic with her, mentioning that I might be leaving town for a while and asked her how she felt about that why you are asking this?, you don't want to be with me? and I responded I love spending time with you, but sometimes I feel like you need your space despite what you tell me and that we should communicate about the way that we feel, not just about the way we *want* to feel and I still couldn't really get any genuine reply out of her except that she didn't like that I talked about this.
* This *really* shocked me, for one I am 16-17 cm when fully erect, which has never been too small for any of the girls I have been with, some of them being wider and deeper than her: I find it extremely hard to believe that she actually thinks this since every time we fuck she complains that it's too deep! It could very well be the case that she prefers a wider member (I haven't really measured my girth, but I know it's above average), or that she prefers to be penetrated deeper despite those complaints during sex- I really don't know. Maybe she just likes the 18cm+ packages and thinks anything below it is too small for her, I really can't say and there is no way to approach this topic elegantly or without making myself look insecure or weak.
* I can understand this, at times I think I was a bit selfish- like when we went to pick up my visa I asked her to come with me and she reluctantly accepted. She hated Chicago and generally felt like I didn't care about how she felt despite her obvious feeling towards this. However, I can't account for the 'plan to break up' since when I talked to her about needing space, I also mentioned that if we don't properly communicate about her feeling then whatever she buried will come back around and remain as an unsolved problem. I said I could feel that she wanted to break up before and during the time I was away, and that if she wanted to end things we could do it peacefully and still be friends.. Meaning, I would still go to China with her and have a good time. She replied that she didn't feel the same way that she did when she was upset and that she loves me and wants to be with me and thinks I am worried that I might break up with her-- I am on the fence about whether I should've said this at all, which probably means I shouldn't have, because I needed to reassure her that I wasn't worried, and that the intention of bringing this up was to let her know that I just want her to be happy.

So now we are fine, she is happy and I am happy enough. I just want to get some criticism on how I could've handled this better, or if I should just break up with her. Some of the things she said were just plain spiteful and untrue (like that comment about my penis, and disrespecting me with the child/little boyfriend comments), I can't really dissect accurately why she would do this, but if I were to guess a reason it was because she was mad at me for being selfish..
   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend has some complaints and comments about me to a mutual friend through text message about me while I was away, friend shows me these out of respect, and I approach her on a couple of the complaints but remain silent about the rest-- defending myself on those topics will only make me look weak or insecure.

i'm not bragging. our finances are mostly joint and we pay very little money to rent a room in a friend's tiny house which is ultimately shared among 4-5 people. it's not terrible, but it was intended as a temporary arrangement, and i hated the loss of independence in going from an apartment that was *just ours* to a place where i need to hide to get some personal space (plus all the other standard roommate complaints, dishes/food sharing/etc.).

12681,Breakups,27w08k,"A year ago I was in a bad place in my life. I was 18 and just moved out of my physically+emotionally abusive parents' home, living by myself. I had been pretty sheltered as a kid and when I met him I'd never kissed or had sex with anyone, drank or smoked, or really got close with a guy. I don't know if I'd call him abusive - he never assaulted me physically or sexually. Often I would go along with what he wanted to do because I wanted to make him happy. Sometimes he would pressure me into doing things I didn't want to do, like mix drugs or find a girl for a threesome. Once or twice he made up stories that would make me question my sanity (he would tell me a lie that I believed to be true as I was often forgetful from drinking or smoking) without realizing the effects that these lies would have on me.

Despite this, he did a lot of good things for me too. He helped me build up my confidence as I was still a very self conscious teen. He convinced me to start seeing a therapist. He gave me advice on coping with my past abuse as he went through the same thing, and worse. We went through so many of my 'firsts' together. I felt comfortable telling him things that I can't tell the other people in my life. I was able to open up to him, but towards the end he felt worse and worse about everything we did and couldn't see me anymore.

It's been 6 months and don't think about him as much as I used to, but sometimes I get the urge to see him again. I've tried to get him to see me but he won't. I understand why, but I want to figure out how to get myself to detach from him. The thought of sex with him still turns me on like nothing else. I keep thinking about how different of a person I am from last year, about how I want to give it another chance, about how much better it would be now that I know myself and my boundaries better.

We spent time together 3 or 4 times a week last semester

Since mid December, she started taking ages to reply to my texts and this led to me really missing her.

We had an argument about it, she says she doesn't see replying to people instantly as important and prefers taking to them in real life, but I was convinced that taking 20 seconds out of your time to reply and make the other person happy really isn't difficult, which led to her getting defensive over it.

Anyway, I just accepted this and figured once we get back to uni things would be back to normal.

So we meet the first night back (last Sunday) and have a good time. Then she says we have exams so it's best if we don't see each other until they finish.

I say we can just revise together, eventually I convince her and we did this Thursday, once again I felt happy and I stayed over and she seemed really into it.

However, we made plans to revise together on Saturday... she blew me off saying she was ill, then Sunday she said I could come over... blew me off again as I was walking out my door saying she was ill again.

So I figure she's just stressed and wants to do work for exams, she says she's still looking forward to Wednesday (yesterday) when we finish and can spend time together at last

Well our last exam was yesterday and we'd planned to get absolutely hammered together, we do this, she stays over at mine, but then after we have sex she gets up and goes to leave

So obviously I'm not happy, after not spending time together for so long, we finally have a night free and she doesn't even want to stay over.

We have a long talk, where she says she gets anxiety around when around people too much, but I bring up that she's constantly hanging out with her friends. 

She then starts saying she feels she doesn't deserve me, how all her friends are always complaining about their boyfriends not replying or wanting to spend time, and then she's got a guy who wants to, but she isn't returning it.

She says she wouldn't want to get with a guy other than me, but she feels really tied down in a relationship this young (she's never been in one before) and feels I should start looking for a girl who likes spending as much time together as I do, and that it really gets her down when I get upset over her not spending time with me. I tell her I don't want to find anyone else

She stays over and we had a fun time, then I asked her this morning when she next wants to meet up, she says maybe Sunday.

Now I mean, after 1 month apart over Christmas and then the stress of exams, I was looking forward to nothing more than spending time with her during the few days break between final exam and lectures restarting, I just couldn't believe she didn't feel the same way, I didn't say anything about it though, because I didn't want to cause an argument. I'm just really not sure where I stand with her, because when we're together we have so much fun and enjoy it, but then after she leaves it's like she doesn't want to spend any time with me...

She broke up with me because she thought we didn't have anything in common and that I was an asshole. I've been seriously looking over myself and the relationship for the past few weeks. I love her so much. I can't even start to get over her no matter how much I try. When I see her and hear her voice almost every day, and know that she doesn't care about me anymore completely crushes me. 

I've been writing down things I don't like about her as a coping method but its hardly working. We started dating last September because we had a lot in common. There was mutual attraction. We started out as best friends. I had a a HUGE crush on her and apparently she had one on me too.
The year of dating was mostly great but I let my friends influence me and I started acting like an asshole and often didn't want to show her affection in public. My ego got too big and I don't blame her for wanting to end the relationship despite the amount of times we wrote each other long, sweet paragraphs about how much we loved each other. I'm probably holding onto false hope that she still has strong feelings for me and is just waiting for me to change. Or maybe she's easily moving on and looking for another guy. I nearly cry at the thought of her with another guy. I'm so insecure about it because I honestly thought we were destined for each other.

She told me numerous times that she thought I was her soul mate. I don't see me being happy any time in the near future. I miss her so much. I relied on her a lot for my emotional needs and now I can't talk to her at all about any of my emotions. I don't want to bother my closest friends about it because that's all I've been talking about for the first couple weeks and I still do. I live far out in the country out of the city where it takes me 40 minutes just to get with my friends. I feel like that was also a reason she wanted to end what was between us. I am going on a 10 day trip in 2 weeks to Italy (I'm excited about that) I plan to sit her down and sincerely apologizing for messing up as a boyfriend, being too grumpy and depressed, not being affectionate or romantic enough etc. I also want to talk to her about the greatest times we had together to trigger nostalgia in her. We were both very lonely before we found each other. She always fantasized about finding a boyfriend then I came into her life. She said so many times, that I was the best thing to happen in her life. I love her so much and not prepared to let go of her forever. I believed we were meant for each other, and honestly, I still do. I need to show her I changed for the better, that we have a lot in common, and create more attraction between us.

Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 years. My first, her first. She had a sexually violent experience in her past that I helped her get through, we had an unwanted pregnancy that we got through together, and basically most of our adult life experiences shared.


She is a wonderful girl with an amazing personality, and until recently I loved her with every fibre of my being. For the last 4 years she's been pressing me for engagement, firstly mostly because she had massive insecurity issues which we talked about, were duly noted, and disregarded; and now the engagement is a MUST because her dad is an alcoholic who is slowly but steadily pushing himself to the grave. 


It must be noted that until the last 10 months we were having a long-distance relationship and were both at university. We are currently on a break from uni and are both going back to our studies in October. It is for this reason that I didn't want to get engaged. I tried explaining again and again my views (I want to finish uni first, I want to be independent and able to support us both before I ask her to marry me, and our relationship got in the way of my studies multiple times), but it fell on deaf ears. There were multiple guilt trips, in the sort of you are dragging me along and I feel like you are only using me, why don't you want to get engaged, unless you plan to cheat on me as soon as you go back to uni, this is the logical next step in our relationship, you've been lying to me saying you want to get engaged etc). I have told her that I want to get engaged eventually, when I am ready for it as well. I have my values and I want to stick to them. It seems my values and rules are ridiculous and I have to disregard them for her.


She put an ultimatum in place about 10 days ago. Either you get engaged to me or you will break this relationship up. I refused 5 times, and I got tears and pressure and things like why are you breaking us up, this is so stupid, you know what the right response is and you are making the worst mistake of your life and so on. I initially thought she was just really after the engagement but yesterday she said something that made me question her sanity. She said what's the point of living if I'm not with you? I'd rather be dead. When I told her not to talk crazy she said you know what the difference is between me and the rest of the world? I won't `try` to commit suicide. I will just do it. I was furious and told her that this is blackmail, and she just responded with it's blackmail to you, but it's fact to me.. 


I caved in, after 10 days of no sleep, barely any food and constant thought and said I'll marry her. Her demands are that I ask her dad (which I respect) first and ask her before October. I find myself constantly in thought, frowning and worrying about everything. I'm not ready for this and I'm pushing myself into it. Her words were nobody is ever ready, they just try it out. I set down some ground rules, i.e. if it gets in my way, it's off, if it doesn't work, it's off and if it messes me up in any way it's off. She agreed but I doubt she listened..


Since I agreed she's been her old happy self again like she was before this whole ordeal, and says things like We're finally going to be fiances and I'm so happy you've decided to get engaged to me. I have been in deep thought all day long and it annoys her because we are supposed to be happy and excited for each other. I used to be romantic, laugh all the time, cook every day for us both, draw her baths, give her massages..now I feel like saying 'I love you too' is forced. I'm worried that this ordeal of the past few days and the things she said changed me as a person.


I believe she is obsessed, terrified of losing me and that her dad will die before he has a chance to agree that she can marry me, which is a rule she had her entire life. I have agreed to get engaged to her in the past, and to ask her dad, only to change my mind and tell her I'm not ready. In all cases there's been a lot of pushing and guilt tripping, all of it blamed on me and my indecisiveness of course. I can understand that she wants to spend her life with me, and I did with her until recently, because we've been through everything together and we do work well together. I implore you to try and look at it from both sides, I will be more than happy to answer any questions you may have for her side, as I obviously haven't described it in as much depth as my own.




*tl;dr* : My girlfriend pushed me to agree to ask her to get engaged to me, and I feel broken and like my opinion doesn't count for anything. I didn't want it and was pretty much guilted into it. What should I do?

12689,Relationships,1n7u8j,"So as the title says, I've been dating my current boyfriend for 2.5 years.  I want to preface all of this by saying that he's a great guy and I love him dearly.

We've had some problems over the last year or so, mostly stemming from the fact that I lead a very stressful, hectic life and am not very good at dealing with my stress.  This has led to a significant decrease in bedroom activites (down from once/day to maybe once/week).  This has obviously led to tension in the relationship, because he has a high/healthy sex drive and mine is almost zero.  There have also been some serious discussions lately about kids, because I don't want any but he does.

Still, amid all this we have had really great communication, disagreements more often hashed out through civil talks than arguments.  We have been trying to work through the issues and hopefully get back to a happy, healthy relationship.

BUT ...a few months ago a new guy started at work.  He's a nice, outgoing guy, and we quickly adopted him into our friends group, so now I basically see him all the time - at work, parties, weekend activities, heck he even came on a camping trip with us last weekend.  He and I have similar thoughts and opinions on a lot of topics, so we end up talking a lot, and he is *so easy* to talk to, he's smart, funny, etc.

I have no interest in infidelity, not in a real sense, but lately I've started to fantasize about what it would be like to be with him.  Which, okay, that sort of thing happens, but it's been getting to an obsessive degree.  I am thinking about him all the time, wondering what he's doing, worrying about what he thinks of me, etc.  Even going so far as to wonder if he broke up with his girlfriend, would I break up with my boyfriend to try to be with him?

These sorts of thoughts make me feel a bit sick, honestly, but I can't seem to stop them.  I feel unfaithful, sort of the way I imagine I would feel if I was actually cheating, even though its all in my mind.  I am in a constant state of anxiety over it, trying to figure out if this means I should break up with my boyfriend.  Not to be with the other guy, since he has his own girlfriend, but because I feel like if I'm having these sorts of thoughts it means I'm not committed to the relationship the way I should be, and that's not fair to my boyfriend.  But is it really that, or is it just because I am stressed and we are going through a rough patch and normal fantasizing is morphing into something unhealthy as an outlet for my stress?

As I said, I am in a constant state of anxiety, and I don't feel like this is something I can talk about with friends (since all my friends know both parties, and people drink and accidentally blurt things all the time).  But I need advice.  Badly.  Please help?

I'm stretched thin, overcommitted as a new graduate trying to establish my career with a bunch of debt. I feel like I put my needs second all day at work, and then when I come home, instead of unwinding, I'm constantly compromising in the fun aspects of my life (social, common interests, sex). I realize that making it work often means putting the other person's needs above your own half the time, but I feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel right now for me to just be me and do the things that make me happy without always having to meet someone halfway.

Original Post: 

First post on reddit - wish me luck!

I'm about 85% satisfied with the level of emotional/sexual/spiritual support I get from my SO. I think he's worth fighting for, and I want to marry him someday, but I just can't let that 15% go, and we both feel that no matter how much we work, he is unable to fulfill it. 

I think that in a healthy relationship, both parties have sowed their wild oats, and when they are ready to be more settled, they look for a long term relationship and agree up front on monogamy (or whatever) and stick to it. But, I met this guy at age 15 (now 22), we dated for the entirety of my high school and college career, except two minor breakups for a few months (mostly due to distance and growing pains). He was my first held hand, kiss, date, boyfriend, sex, love, everything. I had no idea I would fall for him or that we'd make it this far. 

That being said, I have discovered some differences that we just can't get past. Like I said, I think in context they are small (about 15% of what I'd want in a perfect man) but they eat at me and lead to fights, because I can't seem to move past them. Thus, I'm having a hard time looking seriously toward next steps (moving in, marriage) even though I know its what we need and want long-term. I'm in a rut until I can either let this go or address it. 

1. We are a wash sexually. We've been together 7 years, so of course we need to spice things up but we seem unable to find common ground for turn ons and fetishes (stuff we obviously didn't understand or discuss when we started dating at a young age)

2. We have different social styles. I'm kind of a flirt, and like to have deep, intense conversations and hang out in groups. This makes my boyfriend jealous and mopey, so over the years with him I have not made many new friends. He likes to drink and party with one person at a time, meaning I basically am not involved in his social life most of the time, because that would be too many people and make him overwhelmed and anxious. Plus, I don't drink as much as him. 

3. We think differently and work in different fields. Although we are both intelligent, it is in very different ways, so we don't really connect or challenge eachother in debates or discussions about topics that interest us individually. No way we could have seen this coming as high schoolers. 

Like I said, 85% of the time things are perfect. He supported me through very severe depression, we love eachother and know everything about eachother, we've made big life steps together and both see a future together. But for every 85 minutes that we are happy, there are 15 where we are experiencing something from the list above or fighting about it. 

Bottom line, I'm a naturally curious person and I want a chance to explore before we settle down for the big Marriage. I feel like parts of my potential are stifled and dying because I've never let them grow.  But he doesnt give me much room to do so because he finds my disappointment in him so hurtful. We both wonder if I'm just clinging to an idea of perfection that doesn't exist.

So...am I just a b*tch for feeling so trapped? Am I expecting too much? Do I need to sacrifice these pipe dreams to save my relationship? Or do I need to do something else? I just feel like we are in a rut until I can get past this! I've tried therapy, btw.

A lot of people would describe me as a loud, crazy person, while others think I'm shy and quiet. I'm artistic although its not a skill I particularly like because its all I know and it gets boring. Anyway a bit about me, I'm about 5 feet tall, very petite weighing 7 stone (98 lbs) and I'm black but a lot of people mistake me as mixed or hispanic, chinese or something crazy because I'm light skinned.. I also have a baby face ;-; getting tired of getting asked if I'm a freshman (highschool). I know I'm young and I still have many years ahead of me but I can't help but to get into relationships. My parents are so strict, to the point where I can't go out.(never been to the beach..) I can't do anything until I reach a certain age.  But when the time comes I know I'll appreciate every moment of my freedom.(Due to the restrictions of my parents, in the past it caused me to be depressed and such but since, I feel hopeful to see close friends again.)


So from what you've read, you can see that from my situation that it makes relationships difficult for me to keep, since I'd have to keep my parents from knowing about it. So far, I've been in 2 relationships. The first was recent and it lasted 2 years.  This second guy I met was when a couple of friends introduced me to pot. While I was high I asked Danny if liked me and he said yes. I wanted to keep it as friends cause after the break up from before with Jay, I was finally getting used to being single and happy. I pushed him away and I told him he shouldn't love me but he stuck to my side anyway. He was obsessed with me and I liked the attention. We got along very well. Danny  told me he loved and cared about me a lot and he'd wait for me as long as it takes. He REALLY wanted to be my boyfriend. He also knows my ex and he wanted to help me get over him and all the bad things I've gone through. He talked about me a lot and I thought I should give him a chance, so on the 7th I said we're officially together. We had a very playful, rough relationship which I enjoyed. He had a laid back personality and wasn't the jealous type. (unlike my ex;my ex, Jay was so insecure he never let me talk to his friends) 


I thought it was perfect and I slowly started trusting him and started falling in love with him. That's when everything changed. On the 21st he stopped talking to me as much as we used to.  He started ignoring me completely, he wouldn't hug me, talk to me or even acknowledge my existence. I confronted him about it and he said I told you, we're on a break, I'm not ignoring you. yet he wouldn't make eye contact with me. I tried talking to him but, nothing. I kept wondering if I did something wrong. In the weekend I messaged him good morning and he replied with. Hmh and I just said I understand if he doesn't want to speak and he just replies with K. So yesterday my friend Paul messaged him and I was brought up. Danny said She's a good person but I just wasn't feeling it no more. I'm not right for her. Paul sent me the screenshot. The moment I saw that is when it started making sense. He told someone he broke up with me but when I asked he said he never said that and said we were just on a break. So, I message him a few hours later and long story short he said he lost his feelings for me. My heart was beyond broken. I hadn't eaten right the past few days since he started ignoring me. I'm emotionally exhausted, and I wish we'd just had stayed friends. The moment I fell in love is when he decided to end it. That's why I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. I can't handle the pain that comes with heartbreak. Anyway, its hard cause I want to get over it but we have the same circle of friends. And I also saw him with a girl today, playing so, I guess that's the reason. He moved on. I just feel like every time I feel something for someone it just never works out for me and I'm afraid of getting hurt. I felt better off single but the two people I were in relationships with were okay with it only being in school.

 Tl;dr: I've only have had two relationships and this recent one tore my heart out more than the one that lasted 2 years because it was perfectly fine until I started falling in love with him. He knew my ex and he promised he'd help me get over him and does the opposite of what he said he would do.  I wasn't expecting to fall in love or for anyone to love me like he did at that time for that matter. He ignores me completely and makes me feel like I don't exist. I didn't expect for a relationship to form  between us but I did so because I felt confident and trusted his words. He lost his feelings for me. I saw him with a girl today so he must have moved on.

We decided that we wanted to move in together, so she decided to move into her brothers to get some bills payed off (student loan). During the time she lived with her brother she became a b*tch which became a really big problem, she did not see it and thought it was just me so I decided that it was not worth it and we broke up. 


We were apart for about a month at which time she came back and apologized to me about the issues and said that she was wrong and she understands what I was saying and she wants another try. Also during this breakup the decision to move in together was killed obviously. She moved out of her brothers and into an apartment. 


So last year at Christmas she came over for dinner on Christmas Day and said that she needed to leave at 8 pm.She had to go to her grandma's for some family Christmas things which was fine. My mom did not want her to feel like to she had to be there if she did not want to be so my mom told her that. So about a month before Christmas this year my girlfriend begins questioning me if my mom is going to say the same thing this year. This angered me because I always spend Christmas Eve with her family and never say anything I always thought it was a trade off and compromise we spend Christmas eve with her parents and brother and she spends Christmas day from dinner until whenever with my family. I explained to her that this was very important to me, and she said that she would do it this year. So I thought OK good. 


About a week before Christmas she tells me while talking on the phone that she is spending part of Christmas day with me and will be leaving early from my families to go to her grandmas to see her cousins and other family (she could see the same people on Dec 26). This made me feel quite concerned that she feels her family is more important than mine, she also expects me to go to her families on Christmas Day when she leaves. 


After a long talk with my mom I came to find out that my mom does not like her. Does not see her as a warm caring person and doesn't see a match between her and I. This has weighed on me heavily. 


After my gf made the decision that she could not spend Christmas day with my family I made the decision that I needed to take a break and re-evaluate the relationship to see if this has any chance left.

I also had a geeky major and there were almost no women in my classes.  Now that I'm mostly healed, I'm ready to be more social and eventually start dating.

However, I used to just be shy around women, but now I'm also doubting my dating value.  I'm pretty set on the two types of women I'm attracted to, but it seems like most people are looking for a catch, and they go for the person who has the most dating value within their type.

I don't do ANYTHING to act like a catch.  Aside from wearing somewhat fitting t-shirts, as my arms are huge! :D :D  But my attitude is, Here I am, let's be friends, and I hope we get an accurate impression of each other.  According to a close female friend, and also my scathingly-honest sister, I'm as attractive as a 5'9 guy can be, and very much the sweet type, but I don't have much social confidence.

I get hit on a lot by random women, but it seems like once they get to know me, they get way less excited about dating me.  Maybe it's my lack of confidence, awkward social skills, or they figure out that I've never had a girlfriend.  A catch is someone sought after, who you're lucky to date.

Messages back and forth, long messages between each other, and we have multiple things in common (love of stargate, sushi, and disdain of vegans lol) so we did that for about two months. 

We then progressed into exchanging numbers and started texting. I've tried to keep it even between us, trying not to text too much but still showing interest, etc. we've been on two dates that I feel were successful. 

Date one we ended up going to the aquarium and got to see fish, made stories about how the fishes got in their situation, and pointed out that there are some dead fish. We then went to go get sushi (we both found it funny that after we got done seeing fish we needed to eat some), then afterwards we walked around the city and through the city parks. The date ended with a hug seven hours later. 

Date two was a week later; on this one we went to a heavy metal burger place (she loves heavy metal), then we walked around the local pier and got to stare out at the lake. We took a break to sit down and relax, and I did the whole lean back and put my hand on her hand, super cheesy cliche style. She knew what I was doing and called me out on it, but did it in the whole laughing flirtatious manner, saying if she wasn't actually using her arm to support her leaning back, she'd reciprocate. Afterwards, we ended up going to Starbucks further increasing the coffee shop date cliche and just talked about things like what we were looking for and such, and we both made it obvious that we liked each other and were willing to see where it goes. 

At the end of this one, I went in for a kiss and she gave me a cheek, saying that she moves super slow and doesn't jump to things unless she's absolutely sure. I told her I'm onboard and agreed with her, as I don't want to rush into things (I did that previously with someone else and it ended horribly.) however, we both said that we weren't talking to anyone else (which is true on my end) Another seven hour date in the books. 

Here's where the 'fun' gets started. She's been swamped with work, and the three weeks after our last date she's busy with previous commitments, so understandable that we couldn't do stuff. The week after our second date, she went out of state for the entire week for work. The week after that, she ended up going with her parents to a wedding out of state, and this week, it's her alma mater's homecoming and she was involved heavily with her school so she's doing that, and she said that she has a few friends coming in from out of town to celebrate. 

Now, we've been texting semi-frequently but it seems like it's started to trail off lately. I think I screwed up as I have a dark sense of humor and I made an ebola joke when I told her I was at the doctor a week ago, and she didn't think it was funny. I haven't heard from her since last Tuesday, and from asking a bunch of my friends, they suggested that I wait it out and let her text me as she needs to show that she's interested and willing to make effort.

We met online when we were 11 and had a relationship online for a few years and finally met up when I was 16.  During those earlier years, we'd talk every day on the phone and dreamed of meeting each other.


When I was able to get a job and buy a place ticket, I flew across the country to see her and we had continued our online relationship, but in person.  We never had any sexual talks, but once we got together after about 5 days, we'd fool around and actually tried to have sex (but.. lol failed to go all the way), probably because of the inexperience, nervousness and both of us being virgins).  We had our first kiss on the 2nd night of being together (my first kiss).


I flew back home and we talked for another 6 months until she was able to come visit me after her first semester in college.  During the 6 months between our first meeting and that summer of her coming to visit me, she was in college and we drifted, as you'd imagine a couple would.  I found out that she was drinking, partying, etc.  I found out from her that she let someone finger her during that time.  I held onto that, knowing that that was the truth, but it always was in the back of my mind if that was it.  What guy would just finger a girl if they're at college?


Fast forward:  She moved to my state, we got engaged.  I was working nights for a long time and about 6 months before we got married, I saw phone bills that showed her calling someone every night for hours.  I found out that they were sending pictures and having phone sex.  I left her during that time and I was going to end the engagement.  Cancel everything.  

We talked and talked.. we had serious discussions about how this was it.  What did she want? What did I want?  We worked at our relationship slowly and we got married.  We had 2 children.  We're happy... and we've been married for almost 5 years now.


Like I said - I've always had this feeling bugging me and I just wanted to come out and ask her.  Let my self breathe without the anxiety of wondering what happened 12 years ago.  Did she do anything more? Was there anyone else? 

I approached her last night and asked her flat out, Did you have sex with that guy in college and she said no.  She refused to answer, got mad at my questioning her.  She felt like I was attacking her.  

I have a way of knowing if she's lying and I could tell something was off.  I asked her and pleaded with her to just tell me the truth.  

She finally told me that she had sex with him and it was one night, one guy, EVER.   There was no one else and that she used protection.  I believe her because the timings align with our issues and what I heard from her friends back then.


My thing is that.... she doesn't seem to feel any remorse.   She's actually MAD at me for bringing it up 12 years later.  


I've tried to sit her down and tell her that I just wanted to know and that I feel better actually asking.  But she can get defensive and was mad that I brought this up so many years later.  She asked me why I was doing it, what my motive was.  I told her, I just want to be able to know in my heart the truth.


I can understand her anger and see that it's probably reflected inwards and I'll wait for her to come around.


My feelings are deeply hurt.  I feel that I'm so stupid for having an issue like this.  Why would I care about something so long ago, what about all of those other people who have fucked other people before meeting their spouse?   I guess I just felt that we were special.  We were together since kids and a perfect story.  

I have these questions in my mind:

Did it mean anything to her?
Am I better? 
Do you want to be with me?
Are you satisified with me?
Did you ever want to really tell me?
Did it eat you up inside?


**TL:DR - We met as kids, she was in college, cheated on me in college with a guy.  I found out 12 years later and am feeling weird.  She also cheated on me 6 months before we got married but we're 100% over that issue.  This is a new wound.**

Edit. Time line was weird because I am dumb.   We met on aol in 95. 

I lost my virginity to her. 

She had sex with the guy. 

This sounds like a horrible post and I didn't want to bring it up but this got a lot more responses than I thought. 

All of those issues that happened in the past. I moved past.  I am over them and I know that RIGHT NOW she loves me and she is sorry for what happened before we got married. 

We're meeting for dinner tonight to talk about everything.  We had a big argument this morning because I told her I just wanted an apology. A hug. Something to reassure me that she loves me.  She hasn't done those yet.  She's mad.  But I told her that I need those and that's where we're at.

Would it be unreasonable for me to ask you people how to carry out an extramarital affair? This whole situation is new for me, and to be honest I'm a little lost. 

I don't want him to get into trouble, because I care about him and I want him to be happy. He's a prominent member of the community, so anything in public in town is out of the question. There is also the fairly unique problem that he and his wife work at the same office, so there are major limits on what can take place there.

So far we've been doing most of our communication through text/Facebook/Skype/etc., and we've had a few casual public meet-ups. It's nice, but it won't be enough for long.

The mechanics of an affair are not something that I'm familiar with. He has a reasonable amount of personal privacy, as well as a separate bank account. Those have served us well so far, and I imagine they will continue to in the future.

How do I make the best of the brief time we have together? How do I keep him happy, even when he's not with me? How can I be discreet about our interactions? What can we do, socially? I really want to do everything that I can to make sure that this relationship is satisfying for him.

So I dated Ex on and off from senior year of high school until junior year of college (long distance for the college years). I was madly in love. He was planning on moving in with me so we could be together, and I was in the process of looking for an apartment when I found out he cheated on me (a few times, different girls). I was completely crushed and immediately broke up with him. I didn't even think twice about it. Fast forward a year and a half. Senior spring I realized I had started to develop feelings for my best friend through out college (Boyfriend). After a few months we decided to make it official and have been together since then (~ a year). He's hilarious, sweet, ambitious, but I just have never felt the spark/passion I did with Ex. But to be honest until about 2 weeks ago I never even thought about Ex because I am (was?) genuinely happy with Boyfriend. I thought I was completely 100% over Ex. Even when he got a new girlfriend, I felt absolutely nothing-- no jealousy, anger, sadness…nothing. 



A few weeks ago Boyfriend lets me know that there's a possibility he's moving across the country indefinitely. I was blind sided because we've had discussions about moving in together soon and he knows I absolutely can't leave this city (for professional reasons and family health problems). Clearly, I can't go with him. After talking about it, we both decided that if he goes, we have to break up. It would be too stressful for both of us (emotionally and financially) to try to stay together. So now I'm kind of just waiting around to find out if he's going to leave, which is taking a toll on me mentally. 



Anyway, around this same time, Ex sent me a Facebook message explaining that he's moving 1600 miles away and while he was packing up he found a bunch of things of mine and asked if I'd like them back. I have not spoken to him since the day we broke up (except a phone call about splitting a bill and a long hand written apology letter from him a few weeks after the breakup) and from what I knew I had assumed he was 100% over the relationship, like I was/thought I was.I had no ill feelings for him anymore really. I knew he was truly sorry and he just couldn't handle the loneliness of a long distance relationship without the freedom to do whatever he wanted.  I replied, and we decided to meet for a coffee (which I told Boyfriend about) so he could bring me my stuff and we could catch up.


Well, getting coffee turned into 10 hours of talking, catching up, laughing, and eventually flirting. I have no idea what happened, but it felt like we never broke up. I was shocked because I was sure I had gotten over him. I hadn't. At all. I got so wrapped up in it that I kissed him (he knows I have a boyfriend and stopped me, but I said it was okay. I'm an idiot) I was so confused and felt really guilty but still did it several times (plus a little more than kissing) before I decided I had to go home. I haven't seen him since because I don't want to do anything else stupid. 


I've been thinking about this non stop for almost 2 weeks and don't know what to do. I now really miss my ex who I hadn't even thought about for 2 years until a few weeks ago. I have always felt an insane connection to him. I don't know how I convinced myself I was over him. Maybe I was over him but the threat of breaking up with Boyfriend made me vulnerable and desperate? I DON'T KNOW. Boyfriend has no idea about Ex, other than our history and the fact that we had coffee. I don't know what to tell him. I honestly love them both. Realistically I don't have a future with Ex since he's moving, and I doubt I have a future with Boyfriend after this, especially since he's moving as well. I'm at a loss. 


TL;DR: Reconnected with my ex while I was in a new relationship because I thought I was over him. I wasn't, and I kissed him. I'm in love with both of them and they're both (probably) moving considerable distances away in the next few months. No clue what to say to my boyfriend or what to do.

12702,Relationships,2v168m,"I guess I should start with the fact that I'm an only child so I don't really have a personal sibling relationship to compare this to. 

My husband has 2 younger brothers, Dan (31) and Ben (26). I first met Dan at a family BBQ when my husband and I were dating. I was instantly taken aback at how little they interacted with each other, despite the fact that they then saw each other maybe 3-4 times per year. Neither was very excited to see each other, they barely said 10 words to each other the entire time we there, and neither made any kind of effort to find out how each of them was doing, what was knew, how was work going, etc.  (To his credit, Dan is a *very* quiet person and it's common for him not to participate in conversation or be overly vocal.) When I asked my husband what the weirdness was all about, he said, What weirdness? That's just the way we are. Lo and behold, at the next 4-5 family gathering, things pretty much went the same way. 

Dan and his wife moved quite a distance away a few years ago, so we see them once about every other year now. Dan and my husband don't call, text, or email each other on their birthdays (or ever, really), and they don't exchange birthday or Christmas gifts. When Ben and his wife had their first kid (while they were living closer to us), we found out on Facebook. When I asked my husband if we were going to the hospital to see the baby, he looked at me like I'd suggested we fly to Alaska for a movie. I asked him if he was going to call his brother to congratulate him, and my husband said no. Text him at least? His response: Nah. You posted on his wife's Facebook wall, right? Should we send them something? No, we already got them something before the baby was born. (Which, by the way, never would have happened if it weren't for me insisting we buy something.) The same thing happened for Dan's 2nd and 3rd kids: no phone call, no text, no congratulations. My husband refers to his nieces and nephew as my brother's kids. I've asked my husband before why they have such a distant relationship, what happened, was there a fight, and he always says, No, that's just the way we are. Dan has always been quiet, we were never interested in the same things, we were never really friends. It's just the way we are. 

Onto Ben. My husband seems to be a little closer to Ben than Dan. He's told me numerous childhood stories about Ben, about what a brat he was a kid, how his parents let him get away with everything, how he was the typical baby of the family and how my husband resented him. As Ben got older, they started to get closer. My husband started to like him more as a person and finally started seeing how Ben had been looking up to him as an older brother. I would say they are friendly, but definitely not close. Ben wishes my husband a happy birthday via text every year, but my husband doesn't do the same. No gifts are exchanged, they rarely talk, and my husband attended neither his college nor grad school graduation. While they seem to be a closer than Dan and my husband, I still find it strange that they don't have a closer sibling relationship. 

Like I said, I'm an only child so I don't have anything to compare this to. But I do have friends who have siblings, and when I look at their relationships, they are WAY different than my husband's and his brothers'. My best friend has 2 older brothers (by like 8 and 10 years) and she is SUPER close with them. My good friend from grad school has 2 younger brothers and she talks to one of them every day. My old roommate and her sister see each other every weekend. My cousin's little sister always come to her older sister for advice. My good friends from high school are all in constant contact with their siblings. One of my friends has a brother who lives across the country and they make it a point to take turns flying out to see each other *in addition to* seeing each other every Christmas and at family weddings. Meanwhile, my husband almost didn't ask his brothers to be groomsmen in our wedding! 

So reddit, what's the deal here? I know there are many different kinds of sibling relationships and not everyone is as close to theirs as my friends might be to their siblings. Hell, there are people in my own family who refuse to speak to their siblings b/c of some petty nonsense that happened 20 years ago. But absent a falling out, a fight, a **reason** to be distant with your sibling, is this just.... normal?

12703,Infidelity,1i8je4,"Just over a year ago, I cheated on my boyfriend (then of 3 years). We briefly broke up but got back together after about a week and agreed to work towards rebuilding trust.

I do not have the funds for therapy yet but will be able to start in 2 months time. I am 100% remorseful and know I could never ever ever do something like that to him again.

The problem lies in the fact that my boyfriend told his mother and a few friends about the incident... and then never told them we were working on reconciling. I understand that it is a great personal blow and would greatly concern those around him to know that he would get back together with someone who could do something so hurtful to him. And I understand he does not want to experience that negative judgement and is afraid that if we break up in the future, he will look foolish. 

But... I just cannot continue working on this relationship like this. We live together and are soon to move closer to our families and I want to be able to have that full honest relationship again. I don't want to hide when friends and family visit. I want to be able to see his friends out in public and not stop holding hands because he is not comfortable with that yet.

12705,Relationships,1jas0y,"Last night, this friend (we will call him C for the sake of convenience) insisted on coming over and pulling me out of a party at 2am to come home and talk. At first I was annoyed--he seems to need me quite often now that we're living together--but it turned out to be more important.

Apparently C got a text from the other friend I mentioned (we'll call him N) earlier that day that seemed, through weird and probably metaphorical language (they're both poets, hahaha shut up), to imply he had shown up at the apartment and was waiting to be let in. However, he wasn't. According to C this was intentional and manipulative, because N had once asked if C would like it if he just randomly showed up at his door one day, and C said yes.

C then calls N, and N wants to have lunch. N's grandmother has just died, and he's going to be out of town for a week or so. So they go get lunch near N's place. In the retelling, C seems to be focused on how N was still wearing this shitty hat from a job at a pizza place he just got fired from. According to C this was also intentional and meaningful.

While they are talking, C mentions a story that N once told about how he, as a kid, once vomited and had his father try to spoon-feed it back to him. (I'm not really clear on why this came up.) N says he doesn't remember saying that, but that his father did once put a semi-solid piece of honeydew melon back on his plate after he regurgitated it. I can't remember what order these things were supposed to have been said, but the point is that N changed his story.

C has recently had lots of suspicions that N's stories are mostly lies. I can't really say, because I don't know N as well as C does. I only know that he tells a lot of stories. One is about getting expelled from middle school because he intentionally cut himself in the middle of class. I haven't looked for scars. C says there aren't any.

Anyway, C is now convinced that N is a manipulative liar, and doesn't want to see or speak to N ever again. Fine. That's his life. It's probably for the best if he's having these thoughts about N anyway.

My problem, though, is that I'm attracted to N, and want to seem him again myself, if only to figure out for myself if he's as manipulative as C thinks. 

See, C is *very* paranoid--acknowledged by both him and me--and I'm not sure if I trust his judgment enough to use it in my own decisions. It's a mixed bag, really. He'll come out with really weird and unlikely theories, like the intentional pizza hat thing, but that obviously doesn't mean he's never right.

But is my own desire to wait it out and not cut ties just stemming from denial? I like N a lot, and everybody knows it, and he and I have actually had sex a couple of times. I don't know where that would go if the situation were normal. Is my desire to keep going just based in an unfounded hope that he's actually an okay person like I'd originally thought?

Also, would it be unfair to C if I continued to see N without him? I obviously wouldn't bring him over or anything overtly shitty like that, but is it cruel and selfish not to cut my own ties as well?

None of which, to varying degrees, are traits shared with my current. 

With my current girlfriend, the bedroom is dead, she likes pretty much only pop music, she doesn't drink, she's beautiful but not *as* beautiful,  she finds my sense of humor crude and unfunny (most people enjoy my sense of humor), no kinks in the bedroom (when we do have sex, which I can't remember the last time we did, it is vanilla, which is... okay. I guess.), and just... Our personalities don't align. 

I have known the other girl for three years LONGER than my current. We met in an online game when I was 19 and she was 16. It wasn't anything romantic at the time, she was just one of many people I met through online forums or games, we used to play together, share links to funny stuff, small talk, etc. After about a year of this, I realized I kind of liked her... A lot. It felt weird because of the age difference, but we clicked. She knew the attraction was there and so did I. As time went on, feelings developed, we met a few times, and I realized that I, for the first time in my life, loved this girl. We continued to talk, and after a while the plan was, I was going to save up every dime I made from work I didn't need to survive, I would move out west to be with her, and that would be that. But then my current came along. At first, we were just FWB, but things gradually became more serious. I didn't love her, but I liked being with her. I got cold feet on moving out west. It was the safe option. We ended up making a baby, to and that is that.

Except... I'm just not happy. I think of HER when I have sex with my SO. I text her and call her more than I do my SO, who is atm in a different state from me. I told my SO straight up that I wish she would just cheat on me someday so I can sleep with other women without having to feel like I did something wrong, yet I get so jealous when I hear my interest talk about her lovers. (She hasn't had a real boyfriend since she turned 18.) I feel passion when I talk to her and think about her, for the first time in my life. I've had probably a half dozen girlfriends and at least 50 lovers in my life. (I'm a sex addict, not joking, it's a problem.)

I regret every day that I am with my SO. I feel like I cheated myself out of the best woman I've ever met, and took the safe route in a moment of fear of the unknown. There are much more details about the situation that I will answer should anyone be curious. I just have no idea what to do, or even what the right thing to do is. My interest is devastated that I chose my SO over her to this day, but we still talk daily.

Sorry for the ugly post. Normally I organize and proofread my thoughts but I am on the road and don't have access to a computer.

We have a baby.**","Get ready for a doozy, /r/relationships. I [24m] am in a serious relationship with my girlfriend [27f]. We have a baby together, and live together.

12711,Breakups,1kin0x," Me and my girl have been dating 2010 and last week she decided that she wanted to take a break from me and that she needed space. 

Now here is the story,  I moved in with her about 2 months ago and during the past two months I started to notice things that she started to do, she didn't cuddle with me in bed anymore, she stopped texting me unless I texted her first, She also stopped kissing me when she left in the morning. 

She started talking to this guy that she worked with after the first month of us living together. (that's because he was out on injury so she didn't meet him until she started talking to him.) they never talked about anything inappropriate when they talked it was about work and things along that line. She started going out with him and people from work on Fridays  after work and she never invited me to come along, she also would come home wasted which she never did with me but only a couple of times in our whole relationship. I know she never cheated because she isn't that type of person, she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she did.

 So after being fed up I asked if she was still happy with me, which she replied, No. I was heartbroken because I absolutely am in love with her I know she use to be too, I also started to look at rings to purpose to her. 

We started talking and she stated  she started getting bored with our relationship for the last year because we didn't go out,  we didn't really do anything because I never had the cash to go anywhere. She also said that she didn't feel the romance anymore because we weren't have the fun that we used to have because we started getting stressed out from the real world as she just graduated from college and then we both got full time jobs so we never got to see each other for very long when we did get to be together. 

Then she dropped this bomb on me, she said that she still loves me but she not sure if she is still in love with me anymore. she also said that she tried to rekindle the spark but it never really worked either something happened or I ruined it by doing something she hated.  She also started to say that the other guy told her that he likes her and she said that she kind of likes him back and that's because he's fun and exciting and is very sociable. Which being sociable is something I was never really good at. another reason she said that she wanted a break is because she wants to know who she is as a person without me. 

Since that night we haven't talked, I have moved out of the apartment and moved back home. and things that I have seen from her friends facebook when she talked about her is that  it seems like she doesn't even miss me or is even impacted that I'm gone, even after I stopped talking to her completely. Which I don't understand  because for  the past four years we have been each other's best friends.

 When we were talking about the break I asked if I should keep hope that she will come back to me, or should I give up that hope. She responded by saying don't give up hope. So I guess what I want advice on is,  will she come back after some time and space away? will she fall back in love with me? will she end up missing me after she's been out there in the real world without me? and I guess any advice anyone would want to give. 

 (Also I have started to take strives to better myself, not for her but I decided to do it myself for example, I started working out so that I can get in shape and have a better body, I'm saving money so that I won't have to worry about cash, I'm trying to focus on things I love and also decided to go back to school to finish my degree. I know a lot of my mistakes and if she does come back I know I won't repeat them again. )

 I have all been stalking on reddit for awhile now and have never made an account because I just liked reading /R/Funny and didn't think there was a point to having an account since I never wanted to post anything till now, and that's only because I'm hurting right now and all my friends and family have tried their best to help and said what they think will happen but I would like to know what other people think besides my family and friends.

12712,Dating,2k45p4,"I started talking to this guy about a month ago after meeting on tinder. He lives a couple hours away but visits near me pretty much every weekend. We've texted,  snapchatted, Facebook-ed, ect. pretty much everyday.  


Last weekend we met up.  We clicked and the conversation kept flowing everything went pretty well,  I think anyway. So one thing led to another and we ended up getting it on in his car (whoops...) He seemed to open up to me and it didn't feel like just a hook up type deal. We've continued to text and stuff but I'm still afraid he's losing interest. I'd really like to get to know him more and whatever. 


So here's my question/issue. He didn't act like it was just a hook up type deal and he doesn't talk to me like it either. I want to know what he thinks but I'm too shy to flat out ask. I think I'm just being crazy.

12715,Breakups,2jof55,"So she was my very first serious, long-term girlfriend in my life. I'm not really sure where to go of now and I'd really appreciate any advice. Sorry for the wall of text, I just really need to get everything out there.

So about 3 months ago, I broke up with her because I felt like I wasn't getting as much as possible from my college experience. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't that I wanted to sleep around and have sex left and right. It was just that I needed to do what made me happy without having to worry about whether she would agree with my actions as well. I felt that I was devoting way too much time to her and not enough time doing productive things like working out or volunteering. It was probably the hardest thing I had ever done, but I went through with it and we said our byes. The reason I gave her was that I was only 19 and that I didn't know if I was ready to be with her for the rest of my life.

It really sucked the first week. I had a lot of trouble going about my day and trying to go to sleep. Fast forward a month, I'm having a lot more fun at college being able to do the things that truly made me happy and being able to go to parties and hangout with whoever I wanted to. I was starting to really ahve a good time at college and I felt that I was finally getting over her.

Then I ran into her on my way to one of my classes.

All of the feelings rushed back. I got butterflies and I started texting her more frequently. Eventually, I tell her that I miss her a lot and that I want to try things again. She was hesitant at first because she didn't want to get hurt again, but I insisted. I told her that I had to give us another chance to see if we could work. So we hangout for about 3 weeks and things go really well. It's almost like we are back to normal. 

Then yesterday, we hit back to reality. She gets jealous that I am hanging out with this girl. She has a good reason to as said girl was my ex from high school, but I was not romantically interested in her at all. I told her that in a healthy relationship, both participants HAVE to trust each other. I told her that it wasn't healthy for her to constantly be worrying about what I was doing and making sure I wasn't going to cheat on her. She said she was just insecure and didn't know. She could trust me 99% of the time, but she was afraid for that 1%. This is why I broke up with her in the first place. I loved her and really cared for her, but I didn't want all of the stress of an overly possessive relationship.

We talked for about 2 hours just now, and I told her that I don't think it's healthy for us to be together. It was putting too much of an emotional toll on the both of us. 

The thing that I can't mentally comprehend is that we both love each other a lot. We both think that our personalities are perfect for each other. Neither of us know what is going wrong in our relationship, we just know that it isn't working. What should I do? Should I try again? I'm so lost Reddit... I've never been in this position before and I have no idea how to handle it. If you need any clarification, please just ask. I'll clear it up for you. I'm just really... lost right now.

12716,Dating,2iog3h,"So I've been dating this girl for a little over 2 months now.  It started in the summer back home, but I had to go away to school when classes started up again.  Campus is about a 2 hour drive from home. We both decided it would be too hard to maintain a serious relationship over long distance, so we want to keep it simple.  This means that there are no obligations.

We talk at least once a day and I've been home on weekends about 3 times since the beginning of this semester.  I haven't been back in a few weeks kinda to see if she'd be willing to visit me, if only for a day.  I've hinted at it and she always says I want to, but has never made the slightest movement towards actually visiting.  I feel if I go home again, it's basically saying that this relationship is based around her convenience. 

In her defense she does have a lot on her plate. She works throughout the week and is paying for her education and bills..  I've acknowledged that and told her I don't want to pressure her.

I understand that we agreed on not having obligations to one another, but I feel that if this relationship meant anything to her she would at least try to visit.  I told her I was bummed but that everything is cool.  I haven't gotten mad or upset at her, but I think she knows.  I've tried to stay cool under our agreement of no obligations, but it's frustrating.

So I just want to know what you guys think.  Am I selfish for being bummed that she hasn't visited?  Should I drop this game and move on? If I'm looking for a bit more and she isn't, should I completely move on?

Negative events (consecutively):
- I'm his 20-something person he has been with but second love, he is my third that I have been with and my first love.
- Several instances of seeing flirtatious texts on his phone but nothing too serious and some he has admitted to later.
- Whenever I would try to break up with him he would threaten and attempt suicide and cut himself
- We both cheated on eachother during a time where he was heavily into drugs and alcohol (entire second year of relationship). I cheated because I needed an emotional presence that he wasn't giving me with one person for several months. I don't consider it cheating because we weren't together but he does. He cheated one night as a one night stand and one night with his ex girlfriend. He is currently in AA and recently got his year one coin or whatever.
- Caught browsing through female seeking male on craigslist several times, says he just does it for entertainment but has responded to ads before we met but I don't believe he has actually met with any of them when he did.
- Throughout entire relationship he has been caught in lies about where he has been and what he has done. (ex seeing an ex girlfriend at the airport and speaking with her and getting an old sweater from her, going to a psytrance festival after promising me he wouldn't)
- One instance when we didn't talk for 3 weeks he flirted heavily with some girl and says he didn't do anything with her but I'm not sure if I believe him. He has told her to f*ck off and blocked her number since then but I feel betrayed.
- Him being reluctant to change his phone number or do anything to allow us to move on from his past 
- Overall pathological liar
- Fighting almost every day not stopping even when I am in tears
- Called police on eachother several times, lead to either him or me stuck in mental hospital for 6+ hours
- No trust. None from me to him.
- Feeling crazed every moment of the day, like I can't relax when he is gone
- We are both emotionally immature, but I believe he is extraordinarily immature
- Don't agree on anything. From food to activities to interests. I love science, he loves politics, etc.

Positive events:
- Romantically both agree that we are the best we have ever had, extremely close physically
- Love eachother to the point of obsession. Any talk about marriage and children instantly leads to being in bed. He wants to name our kids after me etc. - Went to rehab to be a better person for me for 8 months. - Enrolled back into my school to be around me. - Writes letters, long messages, spends hours on the phone trying to fix things and express his feelings. - Constantly says he wants a future with me forever.
- After everything that has happened he says he is determined to be seen as a good person in my eyes but does not actually go through with my requests that would help me.
- Love eachother's company and seeing eachother. But phone conversations instantly lead to a fight.

- I know for a fact what I feel IS love. I know for a fact that he loves me too. He doesn't want to let me go, but also agrees we don't work out.

12718,Infidelity,1ytv38,"I found out November of last year that my wife had been having a 3 month long affair with one of my best friends and groomsman. We agreed to continue the relationship if we would seek counseling for our marriage issues and she would seek counseling for her personal issues as to what is causing her to be, in her own words, broken. After a long and painful year she went to a therapist only 3-4 times and we went to about as many marriage counseling appointments. In her words, she had so little of herself to give with where she was and that I took it all and that she's unhappy and she doesn't love herself. She doesn't forgive herself for her affairs it destroys her. But she's not happy anymore and isn't in love with me anymore and doesn't want to continue our marriage.

I found out last night that she had been exchanging I love you's with her ex(also another good friend of mind). After I found out she confirmed its been going on about a month and that she can't do this anymore.

I love my wife dearly. I believe with all of who I am that I finally get her and understand her and why she feels so broken. It kills me to see her self destruct like this and tear apart her family. These men have always been someone easy, effortless, an escape from having to look inward or at our marriage and confront our problems, the things she's done, and her abusive childhood. I want to be there with her and see her overcome these things, but she says she can't do it again. That trying again and failing and doing something to hurt me would destroy her.

I wish I would have caught on sooner and got us into counseling. There were so many precious moments where we were both on board but never followed through. I was always afraid of pushing her too hard. Looking inward and confronting her problems might be the hardest and most painful thing for her to do. She doesn't know how. She hates herself. It hurts so much to watch my wife go through this in spite of the things she's done; the affairs are the symptom of something so much deeper and more painful and I would give anything to be my wife's partner through all of this.

I told her today that I want to be able to tell that little girl she was from so long ago that she doesn't have to be scared anymore because she's this big, strong, wonderful woman who has a family that loves her more than the world. That she's safe and we're on her side. That there is no price to pay for the things she's done and she can come home and we can work through this together. She broke down and cried and didn't say anything for long time until she muttered I'm sorry and I replied, I know. I forgive you.

But it didn't change anything.

My wife won't give up her ex or his family, who were the only real family she had growing up. The ex, who she is seeing, turned into a guy with a domestic violence and wrongful imprisonment record with his now ex wife. He currently grows and sells drugs for a living under the guise of business that is a seasonal attraction. He has a reputation of being a very angry person and explodes when he's under pressure. I remember him punching holes in the wall of our school back when we were in high school together. This is the epitome of my wife self-destructing. She knows deep down this isn't what's best for herself or our daughter. I can't stand by and let someone like that be around my daughter but I don't know what I could even do about it.

After all this conversation, I said that we never had a plan. I never had all the missing pieces and I never once believed this would happen again. We could've done so much more but instead we slowly spiraled down into this terrible negative feedback loop that I couldn't see at the time. I said the answer to our marriage and our problems is right here, if only we would just reach out and take it. I asked her to take a week and do a few personal therapy sessions with her counselor to talk out her mind and then go to a marriage counselor with me. At the very least to say we did something for our marriage when so much is at stake.

Eventually she agreed but she was adamant that she wouldn't stop speaking to her ex for the week. I asked her to say whatever she needed to him, but to please take this week and do it right and give it everything we have. She refused. Said she couldn't stop talking to him for a week.

I think the chances of her coming around and realizing how devastating what she's doing is slim, but with her keeping her ex around it might as well be nothing. I really believe though there is a chance she would snap out of this and we could really work on the real problems surrounding her and our marriage and save our family.

As for me, I have never felt this low in my life. To lose my wife to someone like that, someone who pretended to be my friend to my face, is absolutely devastating. In the likely event we get divorced, it would ruin my future. I was a stay at home dad for two years and eventually got a decent paying job in the casino industry. Recently they cut all of our hours citing the Affordable Care Act so now I'm only working around 22-28 hours a week earning 900-1100 a month. My wife makes nearly three times that. 

We had been putting her through college and we planned to put me through school after--now that will never happen. I'm not eligible for Financial Aid and its beginning to feel like I do not have a future outside of my marriage. I don't earn enough to rent my own place with a room for my daughter and support us. I can't advance my career through college because I can't afford it. If I take a second minimum wage job, I won't be able to go to school and still see my daughter.

Beyond that, what she's offering to just end it is very good considering where I live is a notorious pro-mother state in divorce proceedings. She's offering me 50/50 custody, an alimony of $200 a month for a year, and the savings we have that was supposed to send me to school this year ($1500). Anything my family or I bought for our home I would be able to take. She has no desire to seek child support from me.

But what I can't live with is her ex, this drug grower/dealer with a history of violence, who self-admittedly smokes about $200-300 of weed a week, who still lives at home with his parents, being around my daughter. The thought of him staying over at my house and confusing my daughter makes me sick. I can't live with that thought. The thought of my kid wondering where Dad is and why this guy is now where Dad used to be all the time is too much for me. My daughter deserve better than someone like that in her life and I can't stand for it. 

But what can I do? I consulted with a friend who is a Police Detective and said that a restraining order against him and my daughter would have a slim chance of working since they typically require direct acts of harassment or violence. If I take my divorce into arbitration and argue that the court should restrict his access to my daughter, I could lose 50/50 custody if my wife chooses to come after me for doing so.

I scheduled her for therapy today which she agreed to, but I think this will be fruitless if she's still keeping the guy she's cheating on me with around.

At this point I don't feel like I have a future. I'm devastated and I'm losing my family. I didn't make a plan B for this and I haven't set myself up to succeed outside of my marriage.

Long story short -- I am not trying to justify my actions. (There's a TL;DR at the bottom)
BEFORE you comment. 
Realize: He has chosen to stay with me and give me a second chance.
So only helpful advice please, because just posting to say we should break up will not help.
I am not trying to give reasons as a scape goat, I believe reasons give us methods to prevent these actions from repeating. 

WHAT HAPPENED:

I doubted his love for me. I got paranoid. I got insecure.
I made a fake e-mail address to test his loyalty by pretending to be a stranger inviting him for sex.

He actually took the man up on his offer, but it turns out he was just doing it for the role play fantasy and he had no intention of meeting up to cheat on me.

But I didn't stop there.

I tried again. I made about 4 different e-mails in total.
My reasoning throughout all 4 of them changed, so here is a time line.

First E-mail: 
- Original Insecurities made me desire validation of his love and brought me to test his loyalty.
- When confronted he admitted to having the intention of going through with it and cheating.

Second E-mail:
- He admitted to having the intent to cheat on me.
- He admitted to being addicted to the fantasy of anonymous sex.
- So I did it to put him in situations where I could help him say no and help him beat his addiction.
- I also did it so that every time he said no I got validation of his love for me.

Third E-mail:
- Same as Second

At this point he came out and told me the truth.
He had NO intention of meeting up for sex, and no intention to cheat on me. 
He was just doing it for the fantasy. At this point everything was fine!

Fourth E-mail:
- I thought he was suspicious of me. And I figured if the e-mails stopped as soon as we were fine, it would place more heat on me.
- I tried one more time to create a believable persona. Because things were fine between us I wanted to take the heat off of me and make it seem like a real person was inviting him for sex.

But then I thought how wrong all of this was.
So I vowed never to do it again.
I came clean to him a week later (two days ago), and he was devastated.

Past the initial reaction of anger, and wanting to break up.
He decided to stay with me and give him another chance
But I know it will be over the moment I hurt him again.

WHAT I AM DOING TO FIX IT:

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on Tuesday.
I want to go through therapy to ensure I never act in this fashion again.

I have vowed to never hurt him again and to never stab him in the back again.

I have vowed to only make him happy, because he deserves no other feelings because of how much of a beautiful person he is.

But what do you think I can do in addition to this?

And PLEASE give him advice as well. I am willing to take all the slings and arrows you can throw.
But it is him that needs the help and support to get over this.

He is a very wonderful person and I am blessed to have a chance to turn this all around.
Please give all the advice to both of us that you can muster.

tl;dr I was paranoid and insecure. Made about 4 e-mail addresses to test my Fiancee's loyalty to me. I came clean. He is devastated and hurt. I am seeking therapy, I am devoting myself to change and will never hurt him again. I want not only advice to me but advice to him to help him through this hardship. I did a truly horrible thing. I deserve no sympathy, and I deserve all the judgment you can give. But he deserves support and advice and people to talk to about this. So please if you are willing, help.","My [23M] Fiancee [26M] gave me ONE chance to make it up to him after I screwed up bad.

We met through gaming, she found my number on skype and called me. It was 220km between us at the time and I were still in school. A amazing year went past. Same week I graduated we managed to grab a contract for an apartment in the town she worked in. Only a few days after my graduation we moved together within 2 month I got my first real job.

It was all great untill late winter. Its a really hard time at the work during december/january. Leaving us very little time and energy to do stuff beside gaming or such on the evenings. We've both quit playing WoW long time ago and we were stuck playing different games, aswell as me playing competetive while she played with friends. January and February we had some shitty time where we barely talked and was in general very mad at everything. This goes for both of us but we managed to come back slightly. It was also around this time we began planning for vacation. 

She have a lot of friends in the UK which she've been seeing when she got chance to and it ended up with a trip there last week of may this year. My work wouldn't let me take that early vacation so i couldn't follow on that trip. I gave her the space she needs because I know that when you go to such a trip you really don't wanna be sit with your phone all the time. We had some chat every other day or so though just to check how it's going etc. When she came home we talked about plans for the winter, a couple from those in UK was coming over for a week which was fine and that we were going to looking for a new apartment as our was very small. However 3 days later she drops the bomb that she will move to UK next summer. We've talked about it before. That she wants to move there but its been in the future sometime perhaps in 5 years. I got crushed. I can't handle living with her for a year only to know she would move. Just waiting for the breakup.

2 Weeks went by we continued but I got alot more caring than I've been the last few months. It was a real wakeup call for me, Began to understand how much I enjoy spending time with her. The discussion have gone from I'm going to move to UK next summer to I need to be alone for a while I stil had to move out. Never really gotten an answer to why she wants to be alone/why she doens't fight for us. She was the one always saying that if you love someone you fight for it as much as u can. Pretty confused by this. When she tells me she wants to be alone it sounds reasonable but when I go to my new place and fick about it just make me lost.

We met a few times having sex and chat but I removed her and everything with her to do from Facebook etc trying to avoid her for good now but its f****ing impossible. She keeps telling me she loves me like crazy and that I should come visit! I moved my stuff in waves. She kept trying to hide stuff/tell me to miss some things so that I have to come back again (Somewhat joke lol but still she really wanted it). It feels like she doesn't dare to tell me what's up or just want to get to date new people? I'm not stopping her from being with mates/play with others by no means. All I demand is that I get to know who it is basically. All meanwhile she've been very jealous throughout the years. We've talked over getting back together and she's been open with the idea that perhaps we can. We'll see what happens.

Last week I went there to grab the last things and some letters because they haven't been redirected to the new place yet. She got sad that I didn't hug her at first. So I told her that I don't want her to contact me no more. I can't stand it. She began crying like crazy and looked like a real mess. I refused to go into bed with her this time trying to really bite off all my emotions for her and it worked for an hour max. Now I'm sitting here all torn up confused, sad, lonely you name it. I got litteraly 0 friends in this town besides my awesome co-workers which I wont see for 4 weeks now. Got no clue how to go on about this. Leaving work to move to another town is out of question unless I find something else like studies or such (But courses doesn't start untill 2015.).

I've grown alot these weeks and feel alot more confident in myself and would really wanna get together with her again but I've no idea how I should proceed. I cut the contact way to early I think. Though I could handle it better. Know that there are plenty of girls around but I really ain't interested. Our toughts are very much the same on important topics, but we've got a few differences. I never ever smoked while she've done it so long she can remember but quit about the time we met. Was fine for about 1.5 years until she began smoking when partying. Eventually I was fine with it. She then began doing it regulary which I also eventually could accept. Same goes with tattoos. Never been into those but she just got her first some 6 months ago and now she got 4 and getting a 5th. I've become much more open minded lately slowly accepting it and now I find it even attractive depending on the art and so on.

How am I gonna go forth with this? We're both very much in love and I really wanna get together again. I have a hard time completely forget her I've tried. removed everything that I could. Doesn't stalk her facebook but I feel more shitty than ever.

Well sorry for quite sloppy writing, bad grammar &amp; spelling. Hope someone can make me feel better.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 2.25 years broke up with me I need to be alone for a while. I never hold her back from meeting friends or do her own hobbies. She keeps telling me she loves me and wants me to come visit every other day while I tried to do everything to move on. Removed social medias, Pics from phone etc. 

I want to get back together with her but don't know how I should approach this now that I told her to stop contact me, that I can't stand it. I believe it would turn out stronger relationship than ever if we both want to get together again.

12722,Breakups,1i2x1d,"Forgot to add in the title that I have been seeing the friend/sexual partner for 5 months. 


This last year has been a big one. Loads of changes for me. Most of them not so great, but there was one very big bright spot, and I ruined it with him. 

Basic story: I spent the better part of 3 years (2 married, 1 dating) with a very odd man who cheated a ton, and generally didn't like touching or talking to me. I am not sure why we got married. Habit, maybe. I knew he was cheating for quite some time, and until February 1st of this year, I looked the other way. That day, my birthday, my husband handed a card and told me he didn't love me anymore. He then asked me for a divorce. I was shattered. I did that whole  let's work this out thing. He put on appearance for a bit. Said he would consider it. I found his profile on a dating website, and made one to sort of show him I knew. Men messaged me but I only responded to the male friends on there that I knew who were asking why I had a profile. Then I got a really long message from someone. Someone nice, and I responded. Mostly because he seemed amazing and I could have used a good friend. We talked and exchanged numbers and made plans to meet. The first time we were suppose to meet, my son had an accident that required medical attention and I stood the guy up.

It should have been over then, but I wanted to apologize. He seemed to understand so I made another meet up time. 

 March 19th was a big day for me. My husband told me that day he didn't want to work it out. Gave me three months to get out of the house (owned by his family). March 20th, I met the new guy. I should have cancelled. I was emotional and my marriage had just basically ended. But I wanted to feel pretty and desired and meet someone new. I didn't want to think about my marriage for one day. Should have mentioned to him that I was married, I didn't. I was scared he wouldn't like me. It was wrong. First big mistake.     

The guy and I clicked. Ended up having a lot of sex. I hadn't had sex in a year. Then a ton of things happened, and I told some more lies. He would stop seeing me and then we would start up again. He knew about the actually being married thing early on, and continued to see me even though it bothered him ( the lie, not the being married).

I am just going to list the lies here instead of going through each one. The reasoning behind them isn't important. They are wrong, plain and simple. 

- Made a fake dating profile, using a picture of my dead best friend, to hit on the new guy. Then used a google voice number to text him  
- Got pregnant (by accident) by new guy. Told him. Had an abortion. Told him I loved him while under the influence of some medication they gave me after surgical abortion. I would like to point out here that I didn't actually love him then. I was merely projecting my need for someone on to him. I honestly would have told anyone I loved them that night just so they would hold me. It was an emotional time. He was there for me, but left pretty quickly afterwards. I don't blame him. Please note: My intention was not to get pregnant. I made an active choice to get an abortion. I did do it partially for him, but also for me. 

- My husband comes from a wealthy family. For a long time, this supported me a bit. But I got cut off from that when I moved out. I have always had a good job and money, but suddenly being out of the house by myself, and having to deal with a lawyer was a bit much for my salary. I have enough money to support me and my son, just not enough to do all the stuff I use to.  I was embarrassed, and the guy and I had only known each other for 4 months around this time so I didn't tell him I didn't have money. I also lied to my family about my money problems. I didn't want sympathy. I took on extra jobs and I was making it, but barely. I should have told him I was having problems and that I no longer had the money I did when he first met me, but the money disappeared so suddenly that I was still processing it. This is important because we often talked about how he was envious of my life (job and free time) , but I tried to tell him it wasn't all that great.        

- I lied to him about buying a video game. He and I played them together. A hobby I picked up partially in an effort to have more fun with him. To lighten our relationship. It was something he enjoyed, and I thought we could share in it together. Also, it seemed fun, at the time I had the money, and it was something I had always wanted to experience. Around the time I started having money problems ( 3 weeks ago) he asked me to buy a game. I told him I would, kept for getting, and then I was broke. Still told him I bought it. Mostly because I was scared that he would wonder why I hadn't bought it. And anything here except me telling him I was broke ( which I wanted to avoid) would have been a big lie as well.  

Those were the real lies I told. Below are the ones he thinks I told, and he has every reason because of my previous lies.   

- That I am now on birth control. I really am. I lost my pack the other night and couldn't produce it when asked. It hurt that he wouldn't believe me, but I understood. Looked for it for ages. Said he didn't believe that I could have lost it. I admitted to forgetting a pill or two once but that I always took extra precautions when that happened because I do not want to go through an abortion or pregnancy again. Again, he has no reason to believe me. I don't fault him on being upset over this. It is understandable. 

- Lied about buying some other things. I won't list the things here because this post is getting long, but kind of like the video game one, only I bought it.

Last night: He came over. Things were going well. Then he asked to see my pills. I couldn't produce them. He asked about the video game. I came clean about not having bought it. He left. I followed. I cried. Told him I loved him. He gave me a few minutes to explain then asked me to back up from his car. I cried some more. Then he left. I called him a few times, left a few voicemails. I texted some. He merely gave me some advice for the future about not lying (solid advice). I told him how amazing he was and then begged for forgiveness.

I don't deserve forgiveness. I lied. I feel like a terrible person, but lying is not the person I am. I was scared and got stupid, and I made some really bad decisions. I am sorry. He was wonderful and I would love to have not leave my life entirely. 

Probably can not be undone, huh? I guess I am just looking for someone to tell me it is going to be ok. I have this hope (because I am always have hope) that he will contact me and we can talk again. We got along famously. Is it wrong to hope?            

There is a huge chance he didn't feel the same way about me. I lied, and he kept him from getting close to me, but the last two months we have been getting closer. He was my nice thing in a pit of horrible occurrences.   

I know I am a big bastard for lying to him. I just got scared. I just wanted to make him happy. No excuses though. I was wrong. No covering that up. 

This is the short version. There are things in between. He wasn't always great to me, but we all make mistakes. I knew he was just coming from a scared place, and I didn't exactly deserve his kindness. 

If anyone needs any further information, please let me know. I know this is all a bit confusing. Sorry about that. It is a big mess. 
  
**tl;dr**: Girl meets boy. Does stupid things. Messes up big. Boy leaves girl. Now she is heartbroken. Is it okay to hope for some sort reconciliation? 


Edit: I want to add that I am not so much worried about me. I'll hurt and want for a while, but I am worried about him. I hurt him, and that is the worst thing about this all. I hate that I hurt him.

12723,Relationships,32th9t,"We have been dating for one year, three months.  It seems more complicated than it should be, and I'm wondering if this is something to work through or if I'm in the wrong, or if we simply want different things.





**Background**:   I was common-law for 9 years (and have a 6 year old son).  When I first met my BF, my common-law partner and I had decided to separate.  However, due to complicated issues, we kept our house.  Our house has a separate unit.  On the days I'm with our son, ex-partner stays in the unit.  On the days he's with our son, I stay in the unit.  It is a temporary measure, and it allows us to provide some stability to our son (who seems quite content).  My ex and I are not the least bit hostile (nor do we have any romantic feelings left), so this arrangement works for now, but we are moving forward to sell the house.






**I was very upfront with BF** about my situation, the reasons behind it.  BF has his own home and also has a 7 year old son.  As it stands, I see my BF on most days (or at *least* 4 out of 7), either alone on days ex has my son, or with the boys (who get along great).




**I don't want to make this long and boring** but obviously there are LOTS of details I could include (I won't).  Here's what I'm running up against.  BF seems to feel he is lacking a real family and stability for his son, and has always wanted me to move in with him ASAP (I mean he even mentioned it 1 month in).  I am absolutely not interested in moving in together yet.  Even though it feels like we've been through a lot together, we've only been dating for 1.3 years at this point.





He is unhappy with this and often gets stressed because of it.  He has a hard time keeping a handle on his domestic life, and really would like me there.  I do help him loads with things like washing, cleaning son's room, making dishes for him to eat, taking his dog for a walk.  But it isn't the same as *living* there, and if I'm not around for a couple of days everything starts to quickly fall apart.  He's mentioned (threatened?) he'll get a live-in housekeeper then.  I worry about this a lot because in his wild past, he's had sexual relations with all 3 of his previous live-ins.  I'm not saying he would now, but I don't think he needs that temptation.







Therefore, he's always getting upset and stressed, and I'm always running around trying to help him so he won't get too frustrated and decide our relationship isn't working out (because I won't move in).








* He's angry that I won't move in (and that I still share a house with my ex -- even though he knew this before going out with me) and will often bring up the fact that we aren't a real family.  I don't care so much about being a real family right now as much as I just want him as my boyfriend.  Am I being a jerk?  

* Until I'm ready to move in with him, he still acts kind of single and doesn't tell anyone at work about me etc.  He also flirts with women online.  This breaks my trust and makes me more uncomfortable about moving in with him.  He says if I would just move in then we would be a *real* couple and he wouldn't do these things.



* He tells me he is sick of waiting and he NEEDS a partner to help him with all his stuff now.

12725,Relationships,395l0m,"So my girlfriend left her phone at my house, which was unknown to me, and after she got home she sent me a message asking if she left it at my place. I said yeah, and she can pick it up whenever she wants. She said That's fine, lets have a little trust and respect please. Go through it if you must.

I had no intentions in going through it, but that spiked my curiosity and seemed quite out of character for her to say. She's planning on going away for 2 weeks with some of her guy friends and her cousin, and she has been texting one of them back and forth, which isn't a problem. However, I noticed that he had replied to a message that wasn't there. I assumed they started their conversation elsewhere, but that wasn't the case, which made me think she had deleted the message(s).

I'll make it clear that I have no problem with her doing this what so ever, and she is free to delete texts and text whoever she pleases, male or female. However, she sometimes goes through my phone, with my permission, and once I had started a conversation with a female in a group chat, and we took it to private chat as to not to annoy others. She made it into quite a big deal, getting a bit upset as she thought I had deleted messages.

Another point to note is that we had a bit of an upset about a month ago, which caused us to separate for a few days before returning to work on things. A few days before this happened, she started texting another guy quite sexually explicit things, as they had hooked up prior to our relationship.

After all of this was discovered, I confronted her about it. She initially said that the conversation with the guy she was going away with was started elsewhere. After informing her that it was not, she said it was started on another platform. I checked if they were friends on this platform prior to this and they were not. She basically shrugged it off and said I don't know where it started. She only uses a few things to message people on, so it's not like it'd be hard to remember! She then proceeded to get quite defensive and tell me that I was being paranoid, and that I should trust her.

I also confronted her about the sexually explicit texting and she also appeared to be not very remorseful about this, saying that I did it when we weren't together (we were) and It was just a confidence boost.

Is it weird that none of these two things bother me as much as the double standard? If I were to do these things to her, all hell would break loose!

My boyfriend and I are overall very happy. We have been together for four years and plan on getting married within the next couple of years. However, there has been one problem that seems to be continuously popping up: his drinking.


We met when we were both in university, and both of our friend groups were into the party/bar scene. He dropped out from uni when I still had two years left, so he would come and visit on weekends. Throughout this time we both drank pretty heavily on weekends, but as it was college, I did not see a problem with it. It was fun to go out with friends and let loose after a week of classes and work. We never drove while drinking. Since it was a college town, it was easy to walk to all the bars and/or house parties. 


I graduated a year ago and have since moved back in with my parents. My BF lives about a 10 min drive away from my parent's house so I spend tons of time at BF's apartment. We both work Mondy-Friday 9-5 jobs so typically we meet at his apartment after work during the week and then I leave at around 11:30 pm to go back home. 


My BF drinks every night, and typically I do too. However, since I have to drive home at the end of the night I typically have a couple light beers or a couple glasses of wine over the course of 5 or 6 hours. My BF drinks much more heavily, which has annoyed me in the past, because it can affect his his ability to wake up in the morning. To me this seems irresponsible, especially given his age. 


There have been a handful of times when BF has had too much to drink the night before and then not made it on work in the morning, and has had to use a sick day. In fact, his boss eventually moved him from an 8-5 schedule to a 9-6 schedule because he was consistently late. We have talked about this issue before and usually he will be good for a couple weeks and then slip up again.


Recently, my BF has been really good with the drinking. We have both been trying to eat healthier and cooking together every night. He got a promotion at work (he really is an awesome worker, and very smart), which moved his hours to 8-5 again. As a result, he has cut back on the drinking which is awesome. However, this morning I woke up and texted my BF good morning to no response. He eventually texts me at around 10:30 am and says Sorry. I'm home. I call him because I am worried something bad happened, but he does not answer. Eventually, he texts me and tells me that took a half day today because he drank too much last night and pissed the bed. He says he is embarrassed and it is gross. He is angry and ashamed and does not want to talk. 


I am really shocked. And really mad. This is not the first time he has gotten really drunk and peed in his sleep. I know of at least four times other than this time (one of the times was before we met, the other three were during our relationship). Also, this is the first time that he has peed in his bed. In the past it has been in a closet or something that he though was a bathroom when he was half asleep. So I try to calm down and ask him to please call me before he goes into work. 


He calls me and I try to stay calm, but I am so angry. I ask him what happened. He tells me he got drunk and peed his bed. I ask how bad the mattress is and he says it is really bad. I want to know what he has been doing all morning (it is around 11 am at this point) and he says he has been sleeping. I am really frustrated that he did put his sheets in the wash, and he did not look up what to do to clean the matresss. It seems to me like he did something really really stupid, and then instead of handling it like an adult, he threw himself a pity party and tried to basically ignore the problem.


I got really mad at him on the phone and basically told him that he is an immature manchild who needs to grow up. I told him that he needs to quit drinking and to take more responsibility in his life. I was not very nice. I did not yell, but I know I sounded very hostile. In response, he got mad at me for being such a dick to him. He told me that he knows he fucked up and he knows he needs to quit drinking. He thinks that since I was not there and since I was not affected by the incident at all, that I should not be mad at him. I disagree.


Basically, I am really angry and I do not know where to go from here. I want to be able to express my anger in a constructive way and move forward. I really love my BF and aside from this issue, he is awesome. Is there any advice about how to approach this issue?


TL;DR: BF peed in his bed after drinking heavily the night before. This has happened four times before that I know of and that seems like a lot to me.

So I've been having a problem with my guy friend Alex. Alex and I have known eachother since his Freshman year and my Sophomore year. Although we're the same age, I skipped a grade. When I graduated I moved about an hour away from my hometown and started college. Well during that time frame, aside from the occasional Instagram likes, I hadn't talked to Alex. Well about 2 days ago he ended up in my new town to go watch a baseball game at the minor league stadium I work at. Long story short,  we saw eachother again, exchanged Snapchats and when he got home we stayed up till 4 talking to eachother. During the beginning of the conversation Alex confessed that I was really attractive and has always had the biggest crush on me  since high school. This knocked the wind out of me, I would never had suspected that Alex liked me, I consider  myself a 4 on a good day whereas he said I was an 8. Now I wouldn't have a problem with Alex, he's an amazing guy with a really bright future ahead of him and he's actually going to be moving in a month to a different state to continue his education. That being said, nothing can happen now, I know it and so does he. However he said that when he comes back for Winter Break he would love for the opportunity to take me out. I said of course I wouldn't mind and that was that.

Well since that night we've been texting a lot and I feel like through the way he's texting me, he's not really interested. Our conversations seem to be quick and casual unless it's talking about my appearance. He constantly raves about the fact that I have a big butt now and how he finds me really attractive. Any other topic though seems to fall flat. The big problem here is that I mentioned that I might be going to our home town next month before he leaves to see my parents and he just said that it was really sweet for me to do that and that was it. I guess I was just expecting him to say that he'd wanna see me. Reddit, I'm so lost right now I just feel like I'm getting mixed signals. Sometimes I feel like he's bored with me and other times he just wants to hit it and quit it but part of me says I'm overreacting and that he's just a bad texter. Please just help.


Tldr: Old friend from high school confessed he thinks I'm attractive, but I'm confused because he doesn't seem interested when he's texting me.",How do I[20/F] tell if he [20/M] isn't interested or is just oblivious?,0.0,False,3.0,9.0,1440095974.0,/r/relationships/comments/3hr1k6/how_do_i20f_tell_if_he_20m_isnt_interested_or_is/,Romantic
15745,Non-Romantic,1wv8rr,"Fair warning, this may be a bit jumbled. I've been with my boyfriend (Let's call him Alex) for 6-7 ish months now, but we have been friends since we were 15, and his father (Let's call him Dave) is driving him, and by extension me, completely bonkers. We both still live with our respective parents while working towards moving out (hoping to have that all squared away by the end of the year). But in the meantime, we have to deal with his parents. His mom is super sweet, love his mom to bits. His dad irritates me. Beyond belief.

Now for the problems: Dave is incredibly, unbelievably critical. Alex (his only child) cannot do right in his eyes, ever. He is critical of how my boyfriend does things, if he does things, everything. Like one day we were going canoeing and Dave got all in a snit because Alex couldn't remember a certain knot. And the man has no problems criticizing him in front of others (me, our friends, their neighbors, whomever). I have not once, in the almost decade we have known each other, heard his father say good job or nice work or anything nice at all really.

He also isn't particularly sensitive to Alex's feelings. Like last year he was driving home one night and hit a deer. Poor boy was scared to death, pretty upset that he had inadvertently killed something, and called his parents to come get him. Dave makes constant little jabs at him over it. It wasn't Alex's fault, the insurance paid for the repairs to the car, and this was months ago, but Dave still picks at him for that among other things. He also makes jabs at both of us for our vegetarianism, taste in media (we are both fairly nerdy), and other things.

Alex doesn't even bother talking to Dave because it never seems to go anywhere at all. It doesn't help that Alex has a lot of issues with anxiety and depression (currently seeing a therapist) and his dad's comments just aggravate things. All of this affects how Alex interacts with other people. He tends to take criticisms, even small ones, very hard, tends to focus on the negative a lot, and overall has very low self-esteem and tends to believe the worst about himself. He is working on it but it's slow going.

So here comes the question: How do we deal with Dave? Any advice on talking to him or dealing with him? I ask because my first instinct is to verbally rip him to shreds but it would probably do more harm than good (and Alex asked me to play nice). Dave isn't like my family where I can just say That's not an ok thing to say and be done with it.

15753,Non-Romantic,31edh8,"Hey there relationships, I don't know what my next should be. I feel trapped between a rock and a hard place. Sorry, I didn't mean for it to be this long.

I have three siblings; two brothers and a sister, ranging from [28M], [26F], [23M], to me [20F]. We all live in different states in the USA. Background: Our family grew up with some problems. Dad was an abusive addict for a good while. He's doing alright now. Mom was there for us, still tries, but does her share of things that upset various combinations of her children depending on what it is. She's changed a lot.

As a result, a lot of myself and my siblings' personalities have been, in one way or another, shaped by the events during our time at home and after. My brother [23M], who we will call James, has adopted a sort of mediator personality over the years. When we were younger, his end game was just to make everyone stop fighting and be happy. Today, he still tries to be the mediator. He is often successful, but sometimes he is objective to a fault. The usual complaint from me about him is when a situation arises that he should definitely take an emotional position on/make a stand for or against in our family, he will usually just completely stay out of it as to avoid sides. This can make me and others feel like he isn't there for us when we have been wronged. He got a good job right out of college and is doing well, so now he also likes to give advice to the point where I've had to ask him to tone it down. All around he's a good guy, just seems to suppress his emotions sometimes and get a bit cocky from his achievements.

My sister, Jess[26F], does not have a good relationship with my brother [28M], who we will call Dan. The two of them haven't gotten along for as long as I can really remember. Jess had to take on a lot of responsibility when things were going down the drain in our lives, and I think that made her sensitive, hot tempered at times, and easily defensive. She is still this way and can be a huge bitch if you say something that offends her. Ultimately, she is a really sweet person who has contributed a lot to my life. She's very happy and bubbly. She would be there for anyone, she is just really sensitive and doesn't like to be lectured, therefore can be a nightmare to be around if she feels offended. It is her way of trying to cope with feeling hurt.

The oldest, Dan, has historically held a lot of anger over the events of our past, and the ones that are still affecting us today. My other siblings and I have come to terms with a lot of the things that have happened to us and generally enjoy our lives. He has, for my whole life, been angry and struggling to figure himself out, resulting in a lot of lashing out, name calling, physically intimidating displays, and scrutiny of everyone who is doing something wrong in his eyes.

Currently, Dan is very successful; he has worked very hard for years to get to where he is now, which is in a position of employment that is usually occupied by someone twice his age. He is involved in a disorienting amount of extra curriculars; he is constantly busy. He's got a great salary, great apartment, is in grad school, and is always looking to improve his resume; he doesn't let anyone forget these things, whether on purpose or by accident. His physically aggressive and over the top actions have died down for a few years now, as a result of getting himself out of a dark place which was likely caused by the culmination of our families problems. During this time is was just awful to deal with and scary. Now, the main issue with him is still his temper; if you say something he doesn't like, he will freak out on you for it. He will yell, hang up the phone, and may or may not shit talk you to anyone who will listen later on. He will keep you on the phone, ranting about this or that for an hour if you let him, and when you want to get off the phone he will more often than not, make you feel bad for it. He constantly wants to know the updates of my life, my plans for jobs, internships, etc. If you don't take his advice (which by itself is usually good and logical), he looks at you like you're fucking up your whole life unless you instead do something that he will approve of. You need to be doing something to further your life ALL the time. I think he is a good person deep down. I have come to think he is just incredibly sensitive; maybe even more than the rest of us, and gives suffocating advice as his way of contributing to our lives, being involved, and making up for the way he way before.

I am the youngest, been through more schools than any of them and just as many houses. I've gotten the short end of the stick on a lot of things and everyone recognizes that, which is saying something considering the things everyone else had to deal with. I am currently in college and while I have loans, I am getting help from mainly my Mom and sporadically, my Dad.

The Problem is, my 21st birthday is coming up over the summer. I am the last kid to turn 21, and all I've been wanting since before we began to actually plan anything, was just to get all of my siblings in one place. To have a drink with them. No fighting. Take a picture and have a great memory for when things aren't so great in the future. Something I can be happy about and cherish. This is important to me because for the majority of my life as a contributing member of society, I haven't had most of my siblings with me. A lot of the terrible things we all had to deal with got worse while my brothers and sister were in and out of college, leaving me alone for some really life changing things. They all kept in touch, but it was very hard not to have them with me physically.

Today, James and I were solidifying our plan to get all the kids together. He has orchestrated a lot of the planning with me, as we decided to have everyone fly to where he lives. We also decided that instead of having the get together on my birthday, we are going to have it on HIS birthday which is about two weeks after mine. I agreed to this because it was on a holiday weekend, giving us an extra day of fun, as well as an additional reason to celebrate. We decided to also include my cousin Jeremy [28M], who is very close to us.

After getting off the phone with James today, he had me call Dan, Jess, and Jeremy, to tell them the for sure plan, as they knew the rough plan before. I called Dan first, and told him the plan. His response was something like this:

Well, that weekend might be the first weekend of classes for me so I probably won't be able to attend. The other thing is that Grandma is going to sell the house later this year so Dad wants us to go there, so we could just meet there, and frankly, I have no interest in going to (insert city where James lives) because it's dirty and smelly.

My response was that I might have classes too but I am going to try to work it out, so is there anything you could do to try to work it out? He then said that he wasn't going to miss classes for *that*, that it would send a bad message to those whom is made concern. My response, which was prompted by the insult to where James lived, was a fumbled:Well, Dan, not to sound like a brat, but I don't think it's always about you sometimes... It wouldn't matter to me if we were meeting in a cardboard box, it's a family thing and I would just want everyone together, so could we just try to see? Well, I didn't even make it to cardboard before he hung up on me, mid-sentence. I didn't even get to surprise him with Jeremy's potential attendance.

I sat there for a moment, then called James and told him what happened. We talked for a bit, a notable point being that Grandma is my Dad's Mom and not very pleasant. Jess and Grandma don't entirely speak, and overall, suggesting we go to Grandma's was really out of left field. James said he would call Dan and get him to come around. When I hung up, I saw the text message from Dan I had waiting for me that said:

I'm really fucking sick and tired of your nonsense. You are a complete flake, terrible and following up, frankly and fucking liar, you constantly blow people off when they ask you things or offer you help. You lay around seemingly doing nothing half the fucking time and waste all sorts of resources and opportunities. You whine about money when you're the only kid in the whole family that got any kind of financial support for school. That you're a coward towards the world pisses me off to no end. It's a waste of fucking potential. You're not just a brat you're beyond selfish. You call me at work then tell me to spend $700 bucks to fly across the country for a weekend to a city I frankly hate, on a what may be my one holiday weekend, to potentially skip first day of classes in my masters degree for a program of study that meets once a week. Basically equivalent to 2 weeks of undergrad classes. Then you start telling me I'm being selfish and try to guilt me with family although it's really just convenient for you and James. You are completely self-centered.

I was bawling for an hour. I called my boyfriend, who then tried to find the words to help me. He wound up saying that he thought Dan's behavior was learned from my father, and thinks it's interesting that he usually just shits on my Mom and Jess, not James and my Dad, even though my Dad is the root of many of our families problems. Dan's justification for not shitting on my Dad is that he is at least trying to make up for the terrible things he did now. His main source of helping now is by giving us money here and there. He often says: When I come into some money I'm going to help all my kinds; paying for college was something I never wanted any of you to do, which is why he helps me with money now.

Anyway, when James eventually texted me saying So Dan really likes the idea. The dates may work for him, but he's not yet sold on (James' city). However, I'm putting in a good case for him to change his mind. Let me keep working on him and see what comes of it!

I then sent him a screen shot of the text messages. this is the converstion that followed:

James: He says things like that every once in a while to me. Definitely not defending him, that's a little intense. Definitely uncalled for and unture. I'm sorry, he should certainly apologize. Like I said, he does like the idea and wants to do something, but idk if you want to do something with him anymore after that unless he apologizes.

Me: You read over his messages a few times and tell me how you would handle it. 

James: I agree, uncalled for and too much.

Me: None of it should have been said whatsoever. To say it was too much suggests it was a good amount at some point.

James: You are correct. It shouldn't have been said at all. I'm sorry. I told him it was fucked and he needed to apologize.

Me: I appreciate that, but personally, what am I supposed to do? I feel like with Dan, we have all (sub)consciously accepted his typical asshole behavior as normal, and only when he REALLY goes over the top, we say something, because It's Dan. But the fact is, I can't think of the last time you or Jess even said a fraction of that to me. If one of your friends said that to you, you would stop being their friend. I can't stop being his sister, so what am I supposed to do? Accept a forced, likely fake/half assed apology, to keep a peace that obviously isn't really even there if stuff like this happens with him regularly? Which, I realized tonight, is almost always exclusively directed at the women in the family? I don't think anyone has the right answer here because most people aren't/shouldn't be prepared to deal with this kind of atrocious situation.

The rest of the conversation was James agreeing that we tend to just move on after Dan does something like this, that he doesn't believe it's general exclusive, and that I think he is way to old to be getting away with such hurtful things. I said that this wasn't an accidental bitch comment; he hung up on me and planned it out.

A couple hours later, Dan sent me an email. I thought he was apologizing, but nope, it was an email to all the siblings, addressing the trip as a whole, suggesting other places we could go, calling it a siblings trip that was also for celebrating birthdays. Our birthdays were the purpose of the gathering; it wasn't even supposed to be a trip..

I just don't know what to do. This is the worst thing Dan has ever said to me but I feel like if I don't forgive him, the whole trip is going to be ruined. This was supposed to be a happy thing. I mean, I said ONE thing and he *lost* it. I don't think I've ever been ripped down like that. Was what he said warranted by me saying that it wasn't all about him all the time? My brother, sister, and Mom, all think that it was totally uncalled for, but when it comes to Dan, I just second guess myself all the time...What should I do?

First off, to give some background, my girlfriend is very upset with her father for the following reasons. He hasn't been there for her her entire life (she was raised by her mom while her dad traveled for work/his band). Her parents are also recently divorced. They had split up for about 9 months and have now been divorced for a month. The split came about because her dad was cheating on her mom. Jane, my girlfriend, has a little sister, Barb, who is 14 and is having a very difficult time processing this. And the worst part is, yesterday, while I was present, Jane received a phone call from Robert, her dad, announcing that he was going to marry Mary, his girlfriend that caused the split. Jane went ballistic and hysterical. It was all I could do to try and calm her down and hold her while she simultaneously raged and sobbed. Robert (I prefer Dick) has repeatedly said to Jane that she and Barb are just behind the curve and that his marriage to Rachel (mother) was over years ago.

Here's my problem. I can not stand this man. Dick can not stand me. This causes a very serious problem for me as I have been raised to respect and trust the parents in the family. I love Jane's mom, she and I get along great and Jane has said that her mom really likes me and enjoys having me around. Another reason this is such an issue is that I have always had the most amazing father figure in my life. My dad turned down promotions because they would keep him from his family. My dad and I have theological debates (i'm agnostic at best, he's been a hardcore christian his entire life) that always end with a beer and a big hug, knowing that no progress has been made by either of us. So when I'm confronted with a man who so readily puts himself before his family, I literally don't know how to approach that. Jane has very quickly latched herself to my mom and dad. She loves how well they get along and the dynamic that my entire family has. I don't have an issue with that at all, in fact I love that. But I still feel lost because I've always gotten along fairly well with both parents of girls I've dated, and I'm just so out of my depth with this entire thing.

So, a little background. This girl and I dated for about a month before everything came to a head on Valentine's Day. Things seemed to be going really great, and I have to admit that I was starting to really fall for her. Long story short, this girl and I celebrated Valentine's Day on a double date with another couple and my date REALLY wanted people to get drunk. Alcohol was continually being poured until everyone at the party was trashed. 

As the night dragged on, I eventually started blacking out, having only flashes of memory of the remainder of the night. At one point I came to and I was having sex with my date on a couch, which really freaked me out, but I blacked out almost immediately following that anyways.

Sometime in the middle of the night, my date woke up and ran off to her apartment, leaving me by myself in this couple's house. I felt pretty used, and a bit embarrassed, as I hadn't met this couple until that day. My date then avoided me until Monday, where she revealed that she was still really hung up on a past relationship and wanted to stop whatever had happened between us.

While a large part of me is still wrapping my head around the emotional roller coaster that Valentine's Day caused me, I've tried my best to honor her wishes, and I've tried my best to keep my distance from her. However, in the last week she's been making a concerted effort to be around me, and I don't really know how to deal with it. She won't leave classes we're in without explicitly saying goodbye to me first, she stops paying attention during our GRADUATE classes to tell me some strange aspect about her life, and she even showed up at my coffee shop on Monday (I'm a regular there, this is the first time she's come in this semester). 

Things came to a head today when she started following me around before class to ensure we'd walking into the auditorium together asking where are we going to sit?. I simply stated where I was going to sit and didn't invite her. She followed me. While a bit annoying, it wasn't too big of a deal. However, she ended up leaving her coffee mug in class by accident. I eventually discovered this, and being the polite person I am, returned it to her. She got excessively excited about getting back her mug, and looked me dead in the eyes and said I love you.

Regardless of whether or not she meant it (I don't think she did), I felt like it was an insensitive comment based on what's happened between us already. And if she did mean it...yikes... This behavior is really starting to bother me, and I don't really know what to do.

This girl is *not* someone I would normally be friends with, and I'm starting to worry that living with her for much longer might actually drive me to insanity. She's constantly eating things like peanut butter and yogurt and making gross sounds while doing so,  passive aggressively acting like I'm a terrible person for staying up later than her and not turning off the light when she goes to sleep (as early as 9PM), criticizing my makeup and clothing choices because they aren't the same as hers, and yet somehow manages to copy pretty much *everything* I do - including things she once used to call disgusting when I did them.

My Gf her problems begun in her childhood. My GF has a crazy mother. She has 2 children. My gf and her little brother. she is the worst mother ever. she cares more about money then her own children. if there was a scale to 0 to 10. she would be 0. she hits her own children if they didn't do what she wanted them to do. with hitting I mean grabbing my GF head and slamming it a couple of times on the table. Her little brother was better off because he was the favourite child. but these live circumstances weren't to well for the developing child. her little brother turned psycho and wanted to kill her sister. he grabbed a knife and tried to kill her. THE MOTHER DID NOTHING. the only thing she did was saying. I didn't see anything. so I won't chose sides. So one time my GF recorded things her little brother said when he was trying to kill my GF. He said in a very creepy way: I'm going to kill you, cut your neck with this knife. The mother listened to these recordings and threw her mobile phone on the ground.


her dad divorced her mother. Her dad took her little brother with him and leaving my Gf alone with her mother. So a lot of stuff happend to my Gf when she was with her mother. She went to live with her dad because her mother is crazy.


This was a temporally solution. because the dad neglected her. It wasn't really bad when her little brother still lived with her dad. but when he went back to live with his mother. Shit got real. her dad didn't come back from work and stayed at his new gf place and only came back to do taxes. he would than buy food and leave again when he was done with taxes. the food wasn't even enough for the days he was gone. the only reason she had enough was because her grandpa took care of her because he lives nearby. she didn't even get money for clothes from her dad. she always needed to ask for it and when she asked, he got mad and hitted her. 


But she always looked happy on school. I enrolled in her school because my parents moved for their work. it was around the time my GF went to live with her dad. we got to know each other very fast and we got in to a relationship that is still ongoing. i got her into therapy. but like i said when her little brother went to live with his mother. her home situation wasn't to good. So a friend of her mom let her live with them. she knew her well because she lived in her mother house for a few years because of money problems. So the therapist said he would be smart to live with them for a while. and so she did.


Live was very good there. but that didn't last to long. she needed to tell her dad she was going to live there. her dad cried when she said that, but accepted it. the only thing he needed to do was give money to her mom's friend where she lives now. what he did was cut all contact to everybody he knew. changed his phone number and went to his gf house to love their.

Their relationship always had a shelf life, we've all been waiting for him to move away so she could finally end it with him.  Their relationship is an odd one.  They basically live together, except in official title (i.e. she sleeps there every night, cooks dinner, helps take care of his kid) but had to keep her stuff in a separate apartment.  But he doesn't love her.  To be honest, I'm not sure he's capable of loving anyone.  So finally he's moving away.

She made plans to move in with some of us, and we were happy to have her.  She's a great friend, and we're her only sense of individual identity she's maintained outside of him since they started dating.  She's been miserable for years (she was only really happy during the first year of their relationship).  We always assumed when he moved, she'd stay.  She assumed that as well.  But I guess he asked her and told her she had a single day to think about it.

She's decided to go with him because It's a free move.  She's moving across country with a guy who doesn't love her, to help take care of his 4-year old kid (who he treats like a pet more than a child).  She has no friends, no support system, and no job lined up in the area.   She's leaving next month, and we're hoping she'll change her mind.  We've tried being supportive, and she is an adult, but we're afraid she's making a huge mistake.  We're thinking about sitting her down and telling her our concerns.

Her boyfriend is creepy, orders her around, scolds her when she doesn't do what he wants, doesn't love her, and basically just uses her for sex, watching his kid, and to cook and clean for him.  She's a really wonderful and loving person.  None of her close friends like him, and we're afraid if we ask her not to go, it'll push her to do it more (she wasn't originally sure when he asked).  

We're thinking sitting her down, telling her we love and support her, and have concerns, but we'll support her no matter what, and she'll always be welcome in our homes if she wants to come back.  I'm hoping you guys can help us figure out a way to talk to her and maybe help her rethink her decision.

If talking to him would work, that might be an option be he would need empathy to see how taking her with him is ultimately selfish and bad for her, and we're pretty sure he doesn't have any.

15774,Non-Romantic,2c2yo4,"Ok so a bit of background for this issue, I am 23 and only recently gotten out of a very abusive realtionship where I lost most of my friends except my husband and a select few others, I am still struggling with issues from that realtionship plus going through some PPD which just compounds the whole issue. Because of living in fear constantly in the city we lived in, wondering if I was going to see my abuser I did not go out frequently, and when I did it was always in safe places, well my husband and I decided to move to a new city to get away, and because the houseing market is much better where we wanted to go.

Fast forward to now, we have moved and are renovating our house, I am much better despite the PPD which I am now on meds for, and I am dealing with my past abuse and healing, I am much healthier and happier than I have been in years, the only thing missing is that I have no friends, my few friends live far away or have just grown away from me, and I seem to have lost that wonderful ability of children to just see someone and become friends with them. I want friends my own age or slightly older who are in the same sort of life phase as me. Most of my peers seem shallow and self absorbed (not to say that I am not sometimes, I just hate the drama) but people who are on the same maturity level as I am do not have young children my sons age. 

Please help, how can I move past my past start making friends again and having a social life, I feel like having mommy friends will help my PPD but I have no idea how to go about meeting those types of people without knocking door to door, which seems rude. TIA, and btw there is really only one mommy group that I know of in my area and they are all much more of the hoity toity types in much higher tax brakets that sort of thing so I am not really comfortable there or feel like I fit in.

15786,Non-Romantic,202bfk,"My boyfriend's family lives here in town, and are generally really lovely, welcoming people. I feel like we jive, I enjoy spending time with them and I think they like me, too. So I feel a little bad complaining about one of them.
 
 

The wild card in this situation is the Crazy Aunt. She lives with my boyfriend's parents and has been ill, so she pretty much stays home and watches cable news and devotional shows in her bedroom, which, no matter what your social or political leanings just isn't good for a person.
 
 

Even the family members who share her faith and politcal leanings find her hard to swallow when she's in a passionate mood.They'll get 11 texts in a row of very emotional, very disjointed...rants is the best way to describe them, in the middle of the night, about whatever. 

 

One of the more extreme examples are things like the time she snuck into my boyfriend's (unlocked) car when we were over for a movie night and left us a bunch of religious panphlets with notes scribbled on them to help make some point about what health insurance we had.
 
 

Everytime I've met her, I've felt like we had nice enough conversations. I dodge politics artfully, I find out how her health is, I prattle away about things, and try to add a little cheer and novelty to her day. I bake tasty things and share them with her, and I never give her my phone number. Easy-peasy, right?
 
 

One night a couple months ago the long text rant my boyfriend got was about me. She told him he needed to convert me (from what to what I do not fully understand) and then spent a while rambling about hell and how it wasn't a very nice place and I needed to be a better Christian (again, never expressed my beliefs to her). She said it was the last time she'd say anything about it. so he chose to ignore it.
 
 

I'm embarrassed to admit this, but it really got under my skin for a little while. I thought about it all the next day. I was plauged with insecure questions. Did the rest of his family secretly think I was less of a person for not being a part of thier church? What did I do to convince this gal I was hell-bound? Why didn't she like meeeeee?  I felt sad... I made an effort to seek her out and be kind to her and she had somehow taken that and deemed me not-a-good-person.
 

 Eventually I settled into the idea that everything this woman says comes in it's weird way from a place of caring. I get that. She's very afraid and very lonely and this is how she reaches out, right? How sweet of her to include me in her little circle of concern, I thought. She must actually really like me!


My problem is this: she just texted my boyfriend asking him to have me get in touch with her...asking for my phone number. So we just didn't respond. She will eventually see me or my boyfriend at his family's house though and ask about it in person, though. How do I politely dodge giving her my number?

15789,Non-Romantic,2mmlas,"I feel really bad even saying this. My friend does not mean any harm, however I believe she may have some personality disorder or something. There's a lot of things she does that are annoying, but to list a few:

* Lack of empathy. When we see a squirrel on the road, she says Don't slow down! and I'll say Oh, that's horrible! and she'll go on this rant on how squirrels are horrible and there's too many of them. I confronted her once with a friend, and she said the reason she hates them so much is because they ate her vegetables in the garden as long as she remembers (?). She also said that she ran over a squirrel the other day, and she laughed. 

* Repeats the same phrase. Over and Over. A while back it was that escalated quickly. Just to everything. This was like a year after it was popular on reddit. To Every story that had an unexpected that escalated quickly. I mean, I'm guilty of this too, with certain phrases, but god...she just wouldn't shut up with it.

* Which brings me to my next point- She never shuts up. Especially in class. Always adding useless comments, or saying stuff she thinks is funny but really isn't. Teacher will say something-she'll attempt to say something witty in agreement. It's okay the first time, but it's every class period, multiple times per class. 

* And, she never shuts up about herself. We'll talk in a group, and when someone says a story about themselves, she'll bring up a story about herself to either top it, or, it won't be related (or just be related slightly) and like is pointless. Just to talk about herself. 

* Not humble, in the slightest. When her ex broke up with her a couple years ago, she said He'll never find someone as cute or funny as I am. When chair placement time comes up in orchestra, she believes she deserves first, and is very vocal about it. Her reasoning is she's been there the full 4 years, and those who are better than her haven't been. I mean, maybe that's true, however you can keep those thoughts to yourself? I dunno.

* On the boyfriend subject, she thinks degrading people is cute. Back with her last boyfriend, she'd constantly say shit like Boyfriend, you're such a fuck up. if he said something about gaming, she'd be like And you're playing that why? You're seventeen, blah blah blah grow up.

* Seriously, she thinks making fun of people in jest is okay, except she does it in such a weird way you aren't sure if she's joking. And once you know she isn't serious, it isn't funny, it's just *so* fucking annoying.

* Unaware/doesn't care how her actions impact others. Her driving is absolutely terrible. Her driving instructor told her that she may want to consider braking slower to make her ride smoother for her passengers. Her response was to be dismissive. 

* Doesn't take criticism well. A while back she and this girl had a falling out because the girl claimed she was too full of herself (true). My friend had been saying she's better than *all* of the people in her choir, and deserves to be put in a higher choir. Her singing is meh. Girl she had a falling out with told her she was full of it. She was dismissive of said girl. 

* Misc. Annoying habits that just grate on my nerves. She's so loud, sings randomly and excessively. There's being quirky, and there's being weird. She's passed that line.

* Thinks everyone (teachers, peers, etc.) that she has had a pleasant relationship with loves her. No, they just put up with her. 

I'm not in any way claiming I'm better than her, or I don't have my own problems. I do. I know I'm annoying sometimes. I know I have issues. But at least I realize them. 

You may be wondering why I continue to be friends with her. Well, despite being annoying, I don't mind her one on one. She's pretty okay to talk to, although she does talk about herself and she is really negative (but I am too, so it's cool). She's been there for me through my hard times. She's a good friend. 

I feel so bad about finding her annoying as I do. She considers me her best friend (because I stick around a put up with her), however not only is she annoying, she's so, so, *so* embarrassing. She just says shit and you can't stop her and ugh. I stand by her, but not in a defend her kind of way. I just stick by her because no one really hangs around her. 

Doing that kind of holds me back. We're in various activities together, but if you combine my shyness/quietness and sticking by her, I don't make any friends. I want to branch out and make friends, however I have really bad social anxiety so it's hard for me, and I feel bad leaving my friend behind. I also don't want her to come with me to make friends, because she's *so* embarrassing. 

I don't know what to do. She's my closest friend, however I don't know how to move past her annoyances. I might want to address them, but that makes me *really* anxious and I don't think she'd take it well. I also might want to stop being friends with her but that leaves me with not many friends. I'm okay at making friends, I guess, but I'm so quiet and bad a small talk I'm horrible at keeping them once we no longer have classes together. 

Oh, and if were to stop being friends with her, it'd be really awkward, as we share many friends, and we carpool every day. I'll have to see her for the rest of the school year.

15793,Non-Romantic,2pv277,"Hi everyone,

Basically I am someone who is very close to my parents; I'm an only child, I love them both to death despite them being divorced for most of my life. I have spent time with both of them separately over the years and together on some occassions. The issue is with my extended family; I have never had any sort of good family gathering. All throughout my childhood, Christmases were a time of stress because either side of my family I would be with would start fights with each other, make things unpleasant and I wouldn't be allowed to escape to my room. I am very introverted and I need escape plans no matter what social situation I am in. I need to feel like i can take a breather or get away when I feel overwhelmed. I love my family, I love talking with them but I don't like being forced to spend time with them when I feel uncomfortable.

Recently I've been spending events with my dads side as I now live in his city. This includes my half sister (from dads first marriage, she's 20 years older than me), my nephew (a few years younger than me) plus now my sisters husband and his two daughters (late teens). All great people but the kind of family that interrogates about everything. Every gathering I get blasted with questions, with advice. I just want to enjoy their company and not feel judged about my life. I've taken some unusual paths in life and I'm sure for them it's not ideal and they don't like it. They think I'm going to fail and it's just a matter of time. At the moment I'm actually on my way to my nephew's birthday and I feel the old anxiety attack coming on. I don't want to be asked questions, I want to spend as much or as little time with them as I feel comfortable, give gifts and then go home. Sometimes I can take a lot, sometimes I can't. Even if I know I might have a good time, I'm still conditioned by how I've been treated at these gatherings in the past and I can't associate good feelings with my family. 

Once I had an anxiety attack just before going into a restaurant with my dad to see the family and I turned around and walked off because I couldn't deal with it. My dad knows about my anxiety but I still got berated and asked why I was so scared of dinner. I apologised preffusely to everyone but I'm still looked on as someone that can't cope with everyday things and the weird family member.

I just don't want to deal with it anymore. Ive been to counselling for my anxiety but I was told to think the situation through before I react - which is nearly impossible for me because I can't control the anxiety once it gets rolling. It slowly creeps up on me.

15812,Non-Romantic,2yqxb4,"Thanks in advance for reading this. It's long, but it makes me feel better to write this out and I'd really appreciate hearing everyone's perspective on the issue. 


TL;DR: I am in love with my straight best friend and our close relationship, which will never be as close as I'd like, is difficult for me to deal with emotionally. 


We went to middle and high school together, but we didn't become friends until we were randomly matched together as roommates in college. It turned out we had a lot in common.


I came out to him early on, and he told me that he didn't have any problem with that. Initially, I didn't have any feelings for him nor did I anticipate that I would develop feelings for him in the future.  He was funny and nice and we shared the same interests. We bonded heavily freshman year, which made me feel awesome. I've always had trouble making friends, and it just felt good to finally have someone I considered my best friend, who I knew felt the same about me. 


We chose to live in an apartment together sophomore year. Eventually, we began to spend most of our free time together. We would both get home from class, I would cook dinner. We would watch TV, then we'd head over to our friends' house to smoke weed until we got too tired. It was a blast. That year, he started secretly having sex with an acquaintance of ours who lived in our hall. I felt really shitty about it, but I wouldn't admit to myself that it was because I was jealous. I got a little upset with him when I found out, but I played it off as being upset that he was hiding it from me. It's his business, I know, but I wanted to find some excuse to tell him I disapproved. I didn't act any different towards him, but I didn't treat the girl he was fucking very nicely after that. 


One day, I finally admitted to myself that I had strong feelings for him, perhaps going so far as to say that I was in love with him. This must have changed the way I behaved towards him in some way, because he picked up on it too. I remember having a casual conversation with him and he said something like well, that's because you're in love with me. I replied something like yeah, it's so easy for you to talk about. I explained myself, and he was surprisingly cool with the idea that his best friend and roommate had romantic feelings for him. He told me that he loved me too, in a non-romantic way obviously. From then on, we at least had a dialogue going about the situation. 


For junior year, we chose to live together in a house with four other friends, two other gay males, and one bisexual female. It wasn't long before he and our female roommate began having casual sex. The three of us usually hung out together in his room until the early hours of the morning. Once they started having sex, they would both be all over each other in is bed together, with me sitting on the side trying to ignore him. I asked him if he would please tell me when he wants me to leave so that I wouldn't feel like a burden to have around, but he told me no way. He cares about my feelings and doesn't want me to feel like I'm not welcome to hang out with them. 


This situation had already been difficult for me last year, but it hit me much harder this year. This time, instead of being some relatively random girl, it is one of my closest friends and instead of happening in another apartment, it was happening in my own home. The pain it causes me is agonizing and I'm bad at hiding my feelings. I made some nasty comments to both of them regarding the situation. Each time, I would regret what I said, apologize and try to explain how I felt and how it was causing me to react that way, and I would beg them to stop. Eventually, I stopped asking them to stop and started outwardly accepting the situation. I promised the both of them that I would never bring it up to either of them ever again, and I've kept good on my promise. The situation never gets brought up, and the three of us are able to continue being close friends. 

It's still very upsetting to me that the two of them continue to have sex. I have told them both about how I feel. I never gave them any sort of ultimatum or threat for if they didn't stop, I only ever asked them. I can't help but feel like they, my female friend especially, are doing this to upset me. I know that sounds incredibly selfish- as if the only reason they have sex would be to piss me off, but given that they know how I feel and how sad the whole situation affects me, it seems like they don't care. I do my best to not feel too bad about it, but it's proven to be especially hard for me. 

I can't reconcile my feelings for him. I love this boy. I want to be with this boy for the rest of my life. 
I think about him all day every day. Sometimes I feel like he's the only one who can make me happy. I'm not an idiot; I understand how sexuality works. It is no more possible for him to develop romantic feelings for me than it is for me to develop romantic feelings for a woman, but I still can't help but feel incredibly sad and hopeless as to what to do with the situation. What am I supposed to do when the only person who makes me happy makes me sad?

I realize that I need professional help. I began seeing a therapist weekly not long ago. Still, I need help with how to navigate this situation. Ideally, I would find a way to downgrade my feelings for this boy from overwhelming affection back to platonic best friend. I say ideally because this seems impossible for me right now. I would be happy with simply finding a way to accept that I can't be with this boy and not allow him to dominate my thoughts. 

Before everyone jumps on the separate yourself from him and cut all ties for a while suggestion, realize that I have signed a lease to live with him until May 2016 when we graduate.

I tallied it all up after seeing the bills and it comes out to be more. I offered more because I didn't want the bills the go unpaid and him lose money for me living here.

He doesn't even buy groceries or bought any toilet paper or dish soap but he somehow spends 400 a month of the money I earned through my job?

He's an artist that gets a modest fee for his work in the school paper. I think that's all he should get for personal use. He's last roommate left because they couldn't afford the 400 a month anymore. This figure is based on the total cost of rent and amenities but it's going towards neither and he thinks this is fair.

The most ideal solution don't pay rent at all until he begins to pay on the loan each month, split bills evenly, and he only uses the money he earns as spending money. Now it's gotten into naggy mothering mode telling a grown man what to do.

I do not know how to rebuttal what's the difference if it's cash or from my bank or the loan is my money to use until I graduate anyway  or it's all the same together, why does it matter where the money's from. why

I don't know if my thinking is fair, just it never sat right with me for people to use the money i gave them for specific purpose that is mutually beneficial for personal use before getting the totally figures. The last time this happened, i gave rent in cash, they spent it thinking there was enough theyd get in their next check to pay the whole month but came up short and needed an advance in next months rent.

When I was a teenager I had a friend called Tony. He was very naïve and impressionable, and very, very needy when it came to women. Later, he started to become quite bitter. After a few small incidents (being quite two-faced about the boyfriends/girlfriends of members of our mutual friend group, for example) we had a falling out about politics around the time of the London riots and I decided I just didn’t really want to deal with him anymore.

So I grew up, and I’ve heard about him again lately; it sounds as if he’s become really quite an angry, bitter person. My main issue with him is that I’ve heard he has accused one of my oldest friends of “faking” her fibromyalgia to claim disability benefits. 

Recently, he tried to add me on Facebook and sent me a message about how he’s feeling all nostalgic and was hoping we could reconnect. I don’t really know what to do. On the one hand, I like to try to put positive energy out into the world. On the other hand, my friends have valid reasons to dislike him, and while I don’t want to use hearsay as a reason not to engage with the guy, the truth is I just don’t want or need some blast from the past back in my life. I’ve grown up and I don’t want to feel obliged to be friends somebody I don’t trust and don’t have any interest in reconnecting with.

So how do I politely say “Thanks for the effort, but I'm not interested”?

My boyfriend always wants me over there to be with him, but it's unpleasant. 

The title pretty much explains the problem, and this week has been especially bad. Last night was the worst - he did nothing but try to punch me, throw his toys at me, and stomp on my feet. Sometimes he would apologize after and kiss me, sometimes not. I usually responded either by firmly telling him to stop/use gentle touches, making sad faces and fake crying and telling him that hurts me, or ignoring him. It's always very awkward, in part because he sometimes is very forceful and painful and in part because I don't know how to respond (I'm not around kids that often, I've never babysat or anything).

What is more troublesome is that nobody ever really does anything about it - my boyfriend usually tells him to stop or takes me into another room to get away from him, but last night I think he just gave up and sort of watched while I struggled with his nephew by myself.  My boyfriend's sister also ignores what is going on - sometimes she will tell him to stop and threaten a time-out (never happens), and sometimes she will cuddle with him and ask why he hits. Eventually she just takes him into her room with her so they can relax and watch TV alone. 

I don't know how to handle this situation - I understand that it's normal for kids to hit and show aggression when they are frustrated, and I know he is very young. However, it upsets me that there is very little effort made to stop him, and I can't discipline a child that is not mine. I suspect lack of consistency is part of the problem, and I also think he is bored and needs to socialize more - they avoid taking him out in public and he doesn't have siblings or playmates. However, I know very little about children and I don't know if my suspicions are correct (my boyfriend insists I am great with kids but always corrects me whenever I say the wrong stuff about them, so I avoid it because it bothers me). I gently hinted at the consistency thing; he responded with, Well, maybe...but I don't think my sister is doing a bad job.

Our son is 14 years old and entered high school last September. My husband always had high expectations that my son should join multiple sports teams and be an athlete, get a scholarship, maybe go pro ect. ect. Thing is our son never joined any sports teams and has no intention of ever joining teams.


He spends most of him time drawing and writing stories. He's said he wants to work in animation in the future. I fully support whatever desires he has and always have. My husband on the other hand thought it was just a phase and when he entered high school he would be more into sports. My son just really doesn't like sports and told his father that he wouldn't be joining a team.


Well his father freaked out and threatened to disown him if he didn't join a team come the next semester (winter). Now he's threatening to break his play station and take away all his art supplies! I think this is getting way out of hand. I've tried talking to my husband but he kept saying that I should be standing by his decision.

15884,Non-Romantic,1veo92,"My parents are okay people, but they both resent that they never got anything given to them by their parents... even though both sets of their parents have given them plenty of monetary gifts over their adult lives, gave them reasonable attention and everything they needed as children, paid for their college. My maternal grandmother lives with my parents and pays a pretty low rent, especially for the area they live in. 

They, especially my dad, keep asking her for more money, keep trying to refinance their house to cut down their loan rate, etc., etc. My paternal grandmother is described as stingy by my father even though I have never known her to be so; every Christmas and Easter, she sends my brother and I a moderate amount of money and a nice card or flowers, and does the same for my parents. 

Now, my paternal grandfather was wealthy and is now under the care of an in-home hospice nurse because he's a late-stage Alzheimer's patient. My paternal grandmother plans to donate all the money her husband made as a very successful land developer to medical research, i.e. start a scientific grant, give some to the Alzheimer's Foundation, etc. My parents were furious over this when the news came out, even though both make around 100K/year, because it was inheritance. 

All four of my grandparents fought their way up in the world. My maternal grandfather was the incredibly dyslexic son of a dirt-poor Nebraskan railroad engineer who had to sleep on a board shelf because all his older brothers slept in the one bed my great-grandparents could afford for their kids (I heard this story first-hand from him) but ended up pretty high up in the 1970s federal government before his retirement, and my maternal grandmother is a farmer's daughter who went to teaching college at 14. My paternal grandparents are first-generation European immigrants who started a development business out of essentially nothing and also ran a chain of steakhouses. My parents, on the other hand, as I said, generally had everything handed to them. My dad has a history of doing crazy shit (e.g. toppling a dresser onto her, throwing plates and tiles across the room, using a blow torch and a hammer on his cell phone because she called him one time too many) if my mom does anything he doesn't like though he leaves my brother and I alone, so this may be entirely his opinion and not hers. 

When I started applying to colleges, my mother assured me they'd pay for my college. They cosigned my undergraduate loans, and paid the interest the entire time I was in undergraduate school pursuing a liberal arts degree. Now, about halfway through that, I had a huge fight with both of them. I wanted to switch to engineering school, which they think is unfeminine, and they freaked out, so I swore I'd do the 'appropriate' thing.

For me, this translated into adding a STEM minor and applying to engineering graduate school. As soon as I informed them I was accepted to two schools out of the three I'd applied to, they quit paying anything toward my loans. Not only are they upset about my career choice, they're upset I'm not getting married and/or having babies right away (when both their sets of parents are/were highly liberal people who to my knowledge never pressured either of them in such a way), and they crank up the heat every time I come home.

The things they like to complain about most are that I'm an unmarried woman living alone, dating a boy who reminds my dad of his brother-in-law, have no children yet, and that I keep interning outside the state I live in. I love them very much, but keep getting such mixed messages. On one hand, they are no longer paying for my undergraduate loans, when they promised to do so (manageable, because I have a research job, but kind of irritating), but on the other hand, they want me to move back in until I marry, not go anywhere alone (I'm serious, especially if there are going to be guys there), and most especially not live further than ten minutes from them my whole life. I've been too worried about the fallout to get into it with my mother, who does all our taxes, about all the tax refunds from the jobs I've worked over the years (part-time during school, and recently internships in the summers) that I've never seen.

I'm an adult. I'd like to not have my parents gripe at me about how they never got everything they deserved, turn the whole argument into either the no true Scotsman fallacy or some sort of cockamamie tu quoque thing, and then tell me I'm being ungrateful for what they are so generously offering. Other parents apparently hate their daughters/children in general because they kick them to the curb after 18. Apparently nobody else would do such a truly generous thing for their children by letting them stay under their roof as long as they want... and yet if I visit them I still have to ask permission to go anywhere, and my brother or dad has to come with me if I want to so much as go to the grocery store. Anything I achieve in life that's not marriage or having children is generally dismissed as unimportant... yet anything my brother (who is failing out of college for the third time because he doesn't do any of the homework and plays LoL 6-8 hours a day) says or does is regarded as a sign of burgeoning genius. The small SUV that I paid the loan off on (approximately 2/3 of the car's purchase price) this summer while I was in California working? It's in their name, so he commutes to and from school with it every day. I don't need a car, apparently.

Background: My mom and dad divorced when I was really young. My mom had custody of my older sister and I, but every other weekend we would visit my dad. My mom was always angry about something, but my sister would get the worst of it. I always kept quiet and was very to myself when they would start arguing, but always thought my mom was crazy over reacting. When I was 14, my mom and my sister got into such a crazy fight, she kicked my sister out of the house and to go move in with my dad. I honestly have always wanted to live with my dad because of how my mom acted, so when my sister was kicked out I also chose to leave. Once I moved in with my dad, I would still visit my mom, but things were still the same. She still would gamble all the bill money away, she would still lie to my family about what she was doing that day, and she would still very proudly neglect any sort of responsibility.

 My mom does admit to having an anger problem, but I honestly think its more than that. I think she has a serious lying problem, due to her constantly lying about where she works, what she does with money, and honestly about being happy. She fools so many people around her but I know the truth, and whenever I would try to bust my mom on her lies, she would get verbally and physically abusive, and I would just go into shut down mode.

So here is my problem. When I was 17 I got accepted into this really nice art school that I always dreamed about going. It was pretty expensive though, so even with scholarships and FASFA money, it was still around $30,000. My dad, mom, and I sat down, and made a plan about how the first 2 years we each would pay 1/3rd of the cost ($10,000 each) but then after those two years it would all be on me. At first when I got accepted, I wasn't really sure I would even go. I knew my mom was pretty financially irresponsible, so I told my mom when we made the agreement, that if at any point she felt like she could not help pay, to tell me so that I could find other ways to cover that money. She told me to not worry, that she would find a way to get the money (she did not have a job, and honestly has never had a steady job. I think the longest she has had a job is two years). Months go by and the whole time I am thinking I probably will not be able to attend, because of my mom. Every time I saw her I would ask her if she felt like she could hold up her part of our plan, and she would always give me lengthy reasons why she totally could do it. At this point I am thinking wow this is going to happen, and so I go to events at the school, like the new student orientation, class sit ins to see what classes I would be interested, meet my roommates, and even enroll in my classes. Keep in mind this school is out of state, so for most of these things my dad and I are paying out of pocket to travel and attend these things, along with varies fees for enrolling and housing and that kind of stuff.

 Finally August rolls around, and I asked my mom one more time are you sure this is possible and she says yes. So I start packing my things, buying stuff for my dorm, and am pretty much set to go. Three days before I leave for school, my dad, sister, and step mom are having one last family dinner before I go. My sister is texting my mom and is talking about how excited I was to go to school, when my mom texts my sister about how she was lying the whole time to me, knew she couldn't pay, and was pretty much planning on not telling me until the time to fork up the money to the school came along.

I was completely devastated. I just remember crying for days. My whole family had a little cry session when we saw that text. I've never had a goal before honestly. I didn't do great in school, but once I found out about that art school I did a complete 180. I spent hours writing for scholarships, making various artwork for my portfolio, and trying to go above anything I had ever done just to get in. My mom tried calling me multiple times after I saw that text. She sent me multiple texts, saying that I should have known she couldn't pay, that I was just using her, and that I was selfish to ask so much from her.

What doesn't hurt me is that she didn't have the money. What hurts me is that she just lied to my face for almost 11 months. I told her I felt betrayed, but she just kept on accusing me for being mad that she wasn't rich. I tried explaining to her multiple times why I was mad, but she would never own up to it. All I wanted was an apology, but I realized that my mom didn't think she did anything wrong.

I wouldnt say that the school event was the sole reason for me breaking off contact. I would say it was my breaking point. I got tired of her lies. I got tired of her mistreatment of people. I just got tired of her negative vibes in my life. So I just completely stopped talking to her. She would try to text me the first couple months, but I never replied. She tried texting me on holidays, and I still never said anything. Eventually she stopped trying, and its been about two years since then. 

At first I felt great about it. I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. But I also just threw it on the back burner. I don't feel like I ever properly dealt with the emotional issues caused from this properly. My sister and grandma do talk to the mom, and my mom always talks about how she never thought I would be the one to leave her, how she wishes I was still apart of her life, and how she wishes she was there for me in life moments (such as moving out, first job, first boyfriend). Whenever they tell me this I instantly feel guilty. My mom does have a rough life, but I feel like she did it to herself. She had two house foreclosures, filled bankruptcy, and is now getting sued because she didn't pay rent on her previous house. Also, I do have a half sister who I was close to that lived with my mom, but once everything happened with my mom, I felt like I couldn't see her anymore because of my mom, which I also feel insanely guilty about.

I am at the point now where I keep asking myself, is it worth still being upset? I honestly do not believe I will ever get an apology, but the things she has done to me and my sister have really hurt me. I'm not really sure what to do, and would love any advice.

tl;dr- Mom constantly lied. Once I got accepted into a school, we made a payment plan that she promised she could do, but three days before I left she texted me sister saying that she was lying the whole time. I'm still hurt by her actions, but at this point I don't know if its worth being mad about because she will never own up to it. Any advice?

I thought she were at a church meeting last night so those messages seem very strange. I confirmed it with my aunt and turns out she wanted to drive to the meeting herself (she has a permit) instead of getting dropped off by my aunt. 


I didn't tell my aunt the texts i saw but i did something i am still a little ashamed of. I logged into cerberus (an android anti theft app) and pulled her most recent text message to get the context of the messages. I know someone is gonna give me shit about privacy invasion. Believe me, my own mother is no stranger to going thru my bags and reading my text so i know how it feels when my privacy is invaded. However, i did it because i was concerned. I've never heard of this person in her circle of friends. ( I usually drives her to her social events)


My cousin is a straight A student and the sweetest person. She is very trusting and often doesn't know how to refuse people. My aunt also thinks she is the perfect daughter and have complete trust in her. I've also always thought she would be the one we never have to worry about when it comes to teenager problems compare to her sister. 


So after reading her recent texts, it confirmed my suspicion. The texts were about how she had pretended to go to the church meeting and they met at a school parking lot nearby to make out. I don't exactly know how far this make out session went but it definitely involved getting naked and touching parts. They are also planning to make it a weekly thing to coincide with the church meeting. From the sound of the texts, it was the boy's idea and she just went along with it. 


Now here comes the hard part. My aunt is Asian who grew up in a conservative family so i know she would flip shit if she finds out. I am not exactly in a position to tell her either since i did invaded my cousin's privacy and read her text. I have a feeling she would not be too happy when she finds out i did the one thing she refused to do herself. I thought of talking to my cousin but i can see her hating me for the rest of her life. So i don't really know how i should proceed. 


I don't know if this is the normal thing for teenagers nowadays but it is unacceptable in my book to be lying or acting inappropriate with boys at 15. Am i making this into a big deal out of nothing? Should i just ignore and let it go?

A few months ago E let her boyfriend move in, she didn't discuss it with us, he just moved in to our apartment. He's a nice guy, but he, much like E, his girlfriend, doesn't really contribute, and also acts somewhat entitled.

Recently I've noticed that some of the groceries I buy end up missing. I ask everybody because I don't want to single anyone out, but I usually have a gut feeling that it's E and her boyfriend.

A few weeks ago I noticed that some of my rice went missing (it wasn't a matter of expense, but a matter of principal that really bothered me), when I asked E about it she said that she and her boyfriend didn't use it. However, when her boyfriend returned he had purchased me a box of rice and apologized for using it... so.... I really feel like E lied to my face about it (it's rare that the two aren't cooking together).

My other two roommates don't do things like that.

I have a party to go to this weekend and I noticed that a bottle of my rum is missing. I haven't had it since a party in mid-September, so there was still a half bottle of it. It also had my name on it. I've asked everybody, and as usual, I get the No, I haven't taken it.

When I asked everyone today about the rum, everyone said no (including E and her boyfriend), but P has claimed that nobody has touched it and asked me if I have checked EVERYWHERE, which strikes me as odd since I left it with all the other liquor in our apartment... and even if it *had* been moved, it shouldn't be gone, or in another location... since none of the other alcohol seems to be missing.

I'm kind of confused why she's so curious about my plan to address everyone about it. I know the likely reason is because she doesn't want me to accidentally burn bridges because my roommates might think I'm accusing them, but... enough is enough.

This has happened so often and I've gotten so many nos that I'm somewhat questioning my sanity, wondering if I have consumed something without remembering it, or if I've moved it.

I'm up to my ears with it and I get really angry every time I come home because of the seeming lack of respect for me and my things (even groceries).

I know that the rum isn't going to get replaced, but I'm really tired of people taking my things without asking and while lying about it.

I've thought about getting a lock box and a mini fridge for my room, but I feel like that shouldn't have to be an option since I pay rent and help out around the house by cleaning and providing cleaning supplies, etc. Plus, I don't have a ton of extra space in my room.

How should I bring up the situation with my roommates? What do I do from here?

15948,Non-Romantic,2t9i36,"I live alone in an apartment in a building in the downtown area of a small city. I moved in last August. Sorry if this is long, but a lot has been going on with this crazy woman and I want to give as much relevant info as possible. 

I live at the end of a long hallway, and there's three apartments in our little alcove; mine, #4; Crazy Neighbor, #5; and the apart across from me, #6. #5 is between and perpendicular to me and #6, if that makes sense? 

When I first moved in last summer, I ran into the woman in #5, who is older and seemed a little strange but was nice enough. Like a month later, I came home to find a note that had been slipped under my door; it was from #5, saying that she was leaving on a trip for several weeks while her adult daughter, who lives with her, stayed in the apartment, and she thinks the guy who lives in #6 has been trying to break into her apartment. She added that she needed to talk to [me] about it and to come to her apartment sometime before she left. I ignored the note because I was a little uncomfortable with the idea of going to her apartment to talk to her about it, as I considered the note a warning of the situation and didn't see what else needed to be discussed. I took the note seriously though and was very diligent about locking my apartment when I left. Also, the woman just gives me a very strange vibe. So, I ignored the note.

Not long after she got back, she started trying to stop me in the hallway whenever I left, insisting she needed to talk to me. It would happen when I would leave, either to go to work or to take out the trash, or when I would get home from work; it almost seemed like she would wait at her door and listen for the sound of my keys either unlocking or locking the door, and would dart out to try and catch me. Every time, she would try to get me to come into her apartment to talk about it, which I DID NOT want to do, and I told her no thank you, I was busy, etc. Once, while I was meeting a delivery person at my door, she came out into the hallway and interrupted my conversation with him demanding to speak with me. I told her, with the Chinese food delivery guy standing there, that I was aware of her letter about the guy in #6 and was very careful about locking my doors and wasn't concerned otherwise. She stormed back into her apartment. She has continued to do this until just recently.

One day, I heard a knock at my door. It was the girl that lived in #6, and her boyfriend. These people I'd never spoken to in my life angrily confronted me about anonymous messages to the property management company that owned the building that said they were smoking pot in the building (which I thought they were anyway, from the smell at our end of the hall, but I sure as hell wouldn't rat them out. Not really sure what they expected would happen, though). Also, someone had called the police on them and reported domestic abuse, and the cops came for a visit earlier that day. They thought I had done it and were very upset because they said they never so much as even yelled at each other. I told them it wasn't me and I honestly had no clue what they were talking about, and they seemed to believe me. I exchanged phone numbers with #6 Girl and went back into our apartments on good terms. 

The next day I got another note under my door from #5 that both the guy and girl from #6 kept trying to break into her apartment and that they weren't to be trusted. I am positive now that she is the one who contacted the property management and the police. I found it strange that she contacted them about the weed smell and false domestic violence reports but not these supposed break-ins. 

I befriended the girl in #6 and we have since hung out in her apartment a few times, and she told me that #5 has verbally harassed her in the past but since she (#5) has been a tenant in the building for years, nothing was done about #6 Girl's complaints to the property management. 

All during this time, there have been persistent scratching/knocking noises coming from the wall I share with #5. I've been ignoring them. Also, while in my apartment, I have overheard several times the woman in #5 talking to various neighbors in the hallway about #6 Guy trying to break into her apartment and to watch out for him. She told someone that on Christmas Eve he had tried to get into her apartment and she was yelling at him through the door. I was home sick all day and didn't hear a peep from anyone, no yelling, and the couple in #6 weren't even in town that week.

Several weeks ago, while my boyfriend and another friend were staying in my apartment, and we woke up at 8 AM on a Sunday to banging on our door and #5 screaming at us to talk to her because she knew [we] are in there and can't hide from [her] forever. I answer the door, and she says, very aggressively, What is this guy's problem? and I said I really don't know what you are talking about. Please stop bothering me about #6. I don't want to get involved. She said Is your name [#6 Girl's Name]? I said no, and told her my name, even though she's known my name for months. Then she asked if [#6 Guy's Name] was there, and I said no, he doesn't live here and has never been inside my apartment. She stormed back into her apartment. It was super-weird and she was making very little sense.

Up until then I had avoided contacting the property management because everyone in the hall had this weird agreed-upon policy of trying to keep problems within the hallway and working them out ourselves, instead of contacting the property management. I didn't want trouble with anyone so I hadn't done anything, but after this, I decided I would email them Monday morning because the woman was really starting to scare me. However, the next morning, Monday, *they* called *me*, saying that #5 came into the property office all upset and insisted that she kept catching #6 Guy trying to break into my apartment while I screamed at him to go away from inside, and that he was stalking me and she was worried for my safety. None of this is true. I set the record straight and told them everything she'd been doing up until that point, and they said they'd take care of it and to not engage her anymore (not like I was in the first place). Since then she has continued to knock and scratch on my walls, and has been harassing my friend in #6 and telling them that I am trouble. Me and #6 Girl have emailed the property management about this, to no response.

Normally my first conclusion is not to assume that someone is crazy or has mental issues, but this woman is really starting to scare me and management is doing nothing, but I'm not sure if it's enough to go to the police with. She somehow figured out that I live alone despite me making a point of not telling her that, and I am scared. Is it enough to go to the police? If not, what do I do? 

EDIT: I went to college with #5's daughter, who lives with her, for a year and a half before I dropped out to just work. I was considering using my college email to contact her about it, but I wasn't sure if that was a bad idea or not. We live next door to each other but have only talked once or twice and never interacted at school. Thoughts?

15958,Non-Romantic,1s6ktn,"I realize that I am lucky to have a job in this economy and would not want to sound ungrateful. However, it is still a problem and I would appreciate your comments.

So I started a new job a few months ago. My boss was incredibly busy coming in and out of meetings so he assigned me a project that the previous worker had started and left unfinished. This did not bother me and in fact I took it as an opportunity to show that I could do my job. My boss was very nice to me during this time, I would have described him as the ideal boss. He was always very complimentary of me and always took my side.

So when I delivered the project, he took a 180 and treated me in the most passive-aggressive way that I have ever seen. Not only did he give me the cold shoulder, but he also focused on another coworker and generally humilliated me professionally. This was not gradual at all, one day he was super nice to me and the next he made it very clear I was not part of the team. At first I thought maybe I was misunderstanding the situation, but this continued on for days so I decided to have a chat to him. During the meeting he claimed that I was giving him the impression I wanted out of the job. I was like, wtf, but what can you do. I proceeded to assure him that I was very much happy there. We cleared the air, he cracked a few jokes and told me that everything was fine.

The next few days were good and then I went off on a short holiday. When I came back he was fine for like 2 hours, then snapped and decided to continue on with the cold shoulder. I am talking straight out of high-school bs that is not even worth bothering with, so I just got on with my job. He then became quite moody for the next few days (though not to me directly). I'm not going to lie, he got quite scary and I generally avoided him out of fear.

Then one day he decided to play nice and come and get a coffee with me (in the office canteen) and chat about life in general. This was in fact a somewhat private chat and I felt that perhaps I had been mistaken, and his behavior after my holiday had nothing to do with me. I am sure you know what I am going to say next, the niceness lasted 24 hours and he is now back to giving me the cold shoulder which he likes to mix up with short periods of fake niceness.

I have tried to think of what I can have possibly done wrong to no avail. I have never had this problem before, I have always got on with my bosses etc. It is clear to me that he is the one with the problem and that our meeting meant nothing to him. I feel that perhaps he was always like this but he was pretending to be nice so that I would finished the project which he clearly needed to be delivered.

Regardless, realistically speaking I am trapped here for at least another year. Things are not so easy nowadays and I guess I need some help knowing what to do. I have never really dealt with a passive-agressive person so I am at a loss as to how I am supposed to act....

I'm more than happy to go with her as she doesn't know anyone there and says she feels awkward about it but really wants to go because culture etc.

I am a Christian and whilst I am totally respectful of her religion...clearly it's not for me. My issue is there will be a Hindi religious element to this whole celebration and whilst i'm fine with being there I told her I didn't feel comfortable actively taking part in any worship elements as I thought it would be disrespectful to my God and against my beliefs. I also said if that meant I couldn't go at all I would completely understand.

She has now started trying to say it's not a big deal, there really won't be that much actual Hindi stuff going on but won't actually tell me what is happening. Like if there's just going to be a quick prayer or blessing or something i'm fine with that because it's not something I have to take part in but I get the feeling there's more to it than that.

She also doesn't understand why i'm against this because she isn't really that religious and she's starting to get annoyed because I won't commit to going with her/am backing out now.

So what should I do? I will not go if I don't know what i'm getting myself into and I won't do anything I feel uncomfortable with but I have no idea what will actually be happening there and she won't elaborate.

EDIT: To be clear, the issue is not discussing religion or anything, just that I keep trying to find out what exactly is involved in the festival and to what extent I will need to be involved and she won't tell me. I get the feeling it is because she knows there is something that I will be uncomfortable with and wants to avoid the awkward discussion because she has no one else to go with. Furthermore I will be the only non-Hindi person there so it is likely that it's a serious thing not a oh bring whoever you like for a meal. Since she's being so weird about what will be happening i'm worried that I will embarrass her in front of her friends by refusing to take part.

Oh also worth nothing i've only been given a vague timeline of when it will be.

They called our a plan a joke because they think it's disrespectful to our families and the way we're raised, it isn't holy or sacred, doesn't abide by Catholic doctrine, and a minister ordained online doesn't have the training a minister, traditional officiant or priest does.

I've decided to let them come only if they apologize for calling it a joke.

15984,Non-Romantic,2pgl24,"Just so you know it's kind of long and rambly sorry!!!
Backstory: i was raised in a large family in a very rural area. Despite large age gaps I am very close to my two older sisters, let's call them Amy (7years older) and Jill (4 years older). Due to not very relevant reasons I moved out when I just turned 17. Amy and Jill were living together in a state very far away and I had been planning on moving in with them for some time, mostly due to the kindness of Amy. We crammed five people into a 3 bed room (us three sisters and two other roommates) and it was probably one of the most fun, crazy years of my life. However during this period Jill and I found ourselves having to babysit Amy quite a lot, financially and otherwise. Amy has always been terrible with her money. When she went off to college my father was able to pay for her apartment, buy her a car, food etc. If she ever needed anything she could always call up our father and he would either pay for it or just give her money. And for everything else it was put on her credit card and forgotten about. Now, this was almost 10 years ago and her idea of how finances work have not gotten much better. However, my father more or less lost all his money around 2007/8. Thus Jill and I were left to our own devices and are now both very financially stable. And for the past 2-3 years have given much help and advice to Amy. She still spends her money on terrible habits (smoking and alcohol) as fast as she is able to make it. 

So, here is where my current issue with all of this started. A little over two years ago when our lease was ending Jill and I were planning on moving to the opposite side of the country along with her boyfriend (he was one of the two roommates), our other roommate was planning on moving back home, and Amy was going to stay in the current city. The cost of living here is very low and jobs are abundant. Despite spending it all as soon as she got it Amy was making plenty of money. A month before we were all about to move Amy's best friend from back home was getting married and she was in the wedding. She stays there for a weekend and when she comes home she announces that she is going to move back to our rural home town! Jill and I pleaded with her not to do that as it was a terrible idea!!! We are all bartenders/servers and there is absolutely no chance to make money there. Most restaurants there you are severed by the owners/their children/or some of the high school kids. Even if you drove to the closest more populated town (about 30-45 minutes) you're still not making enough to live really and winters there roads are dangerous. Amy ended up moving anyway. Due to a last minute change I ended up not moving with Jill and stayed the current city (this all happened spring 2012). 

Fast forward to now and I live with my boyfriend, my two cats, and a roommate (plus his girlfriend practically lives here also. Sleeps here 3-4 nights a week). We have a nice sized condo and our rent is very low, but we have been looking to maybe up grade to a house. Jill and her BF are still where they moved to, and Amy is still in our home town. Things for Amy have definitely not gotten any better. The past two years she has made barely a living wage, has lived in some of the shittest places I've ever seen, and has gained about 60 lbs. it is absolutely heart breaking to see. On Saturday night around 4 am she calls me and is basically hysterical on the phone. Saying she can no longer take it there anymore and has to get out. Her bosses are terrible and she's making no money. She told me, the other day she had a terrible group of people that tipped her $6, and when I said fuck their $6, her response was I wish but I needed it to put gas in my car so I could drive home (her commute is about 30min). Anyway, after talking for a while she mostly out right asked me if she could come sleep on my couch for a month. I know if she came here she would be able to find a job within days however, she went on to say she doesn't want to get one right away because she's too embarrassed about her weight and doesn't want to see anyone she knows. After I said I can't make a decision like that at 4 am and I would have to discuss with my BF and RM she said sorry she asked and begged me not to tell Jill. We got off the phone shortly after that. My BF heard most of it and after talking for a couple minutes, mostly just being like fuuuuuuuuuu we went to sleep. 

It's now been a couple days and neither of us brought it up. I just really don't know what to do. However I feel I need to address it soon. My thoughts are pretty scattered but here's kind of where I'm at.
1) should I call Jill and see what she thinks? Jill and I are extremely close and I talk to her about everything. So I feel I should be definitely talking to her about our sister. But I don't want to betray( too strong a word?) Amy. 
2) do I say yes? I feel I will become financially responsible for Amy for a small period of time and I don't know if I can afford that. Also our home is already cramped. Plus Amy has never been good with rules but there would definitely have to be some strict rules if this were to happen. 
3) do I say no? I would feel terrible. Like I personally pushed her in with the lions. Also she was the one that let me live basically on her couch and not have a job for a month when I first moved out. Again the terrible feelz!
4) what the fuck do it do!!!!!!?!?!?! 

My BF did mention I should tell her to sell her car and let her move here. At least that way she would have a couple K to her name. She's always been an anxious person and I feel that would give her anxiety and she'd out right say no. And almost take it as me saying no. 

Also we do technically have an extra room (office space). It's my BFs room because he likes to have his own area for his stuff and to get away when he needs to. I could ask my BF to give it up for a while make Amy pay something and that way I don't feel like I'm carrying her. 

So what do you think reddit? Any advice is much appreciated. Sorry about about the ramble/ bad formatting. If anyone is confused at all feel free to ask anything.

16030,Non-Romantic,3bcbd4,"Hi everyone. I was hoping maybe some of you might be able to give me some insight on what to do with my difficult relationship with my dad. Thanks in advance for reading.

-
As a kid me and my dad used to have a good relationship. I loved him very very much, I was his little girl, and he loved me.  

After my teenage years everything seemed to change. I wasn't even particularly difficult teenager, did some dumb stuff, but nothing major. Never did any drugs(though dad was always sure I was using something, and didn't believe me when I told I didn't **Don't lie to me! I can see it in your eyes, you are doing drugs!**), never had any run-ins with the law.   


I did have some difficulties in school. I think I have been depressed since I was ten or so (not diagnosed, but I've always thought that I'd rather be dead than living, so I've began to think I might be depressed.), and that affected my success in school. I dropped out of high school when I was 18, went to trade school, graduated and started working.  

-
Sometime around when I was 17 my dad started the whole thing of constantly telling me how he is so sorry for being such a lousy dad, and failing at raising me. He tells me that he regrets that he used to  always give me everything and how he spoiled me rotten. He reminds me how he had to get by for weeks with only 5€ to feed himself because he had to buy his princess a car. He continues to repeat these things to me basically every time I see him.  

**I have absolutely no idea where this all was/is coming from.** And I don't understand why he even wants to see me, if he has only negative things to say about me? Because he does want to see me. Some part of him seems to love me, and is happy when I visit, but the other part seems to only want to put me down as much as he can.  


**And seriously, I've never asked him for anything.** Never asked to have the newest toys or for him to use his last money to buy me a car. Of course I've always been grateful for everything I've gotten, but I never asked for them and I don't feel it's fair to constantly guilt trip me with them. If I knew then that getting stuff would lead to this, I would have never accepted anything. All I wanted was to spend time with my dad, not to just get bunch of stuff.  


-
No matter what I do, or tell him I've accomplished, **it's never good enough**. I am always met with belittling and disbelief. I don't know what I should do to make him proud of me. I can't be something I'm not. I can't make millions when I'm just a lousy blue collar worker, just like he is.  

-
I've never lost my temper with him and his remarks, I've always just let them slide, because he is quick to anger, and I don't want him to be angry with me.   
**Couple of months ago I finally had enough.** We were having a pleasant conversation on the phone, until he started his usual guilt tripping and belittling. I started crying, cut him off and said ”Dad, it's fucking great how you always have to belittle everything I do, and make me feel so shitty about myself. Could you maybe try to stop it?” And he said ”Ok.” and hung up. I later texted him something like ”Dad, I love you, but you always make me feel like such a fuck up for simply being what I am. I am never good enough for you, and it makes me really sad.”
His respond was ”I am sorry for making you feel bad. I am sorry that I am such a lousy father.”  

And that was the last time we were in contact.  

-
So dear reddit, what is up with all this? **Why is he like he is? Am I just being too sensitive? Am I spoiled?
Should I try to get in contact with him again?** I would really much love to see him and call him, but at the same time I am terribly afraid of him just making me feel so shitty again. **Am I just overreacting? Is there some way to make him stop with the awful remarks?** Part of me wants to just ignore all this and just forget I ever had a dad in the first place, but then again, I miss him terribly.

-
**TL;DR;** **Dad constantly tells me I'm a spoiled brat. Tells me how he failed at raising me, because I turned out like I did. Keeps on repeating for years and years. Makes me sad.

I've been with my Boyfriend, Levi, for 3 years now. He kinda came as a package deal with his (ex)Best friend, Joe [19m] , whom he has known for 8 years, and [18F] Alex(my best friend for 6 years) was a package deal with me. They have been trying to break us up and Joe has been sending me information about Levi's past relationship with [19F](known for 8 years) Zoe.

Back story: Levi and I met around 4 years ago online, we had talked for a little bit, but lost contact for about half a year. When we had gotten back into contact we decided to try out a relationship, and 3 years later here we are! Now Levi was with Zoe before we were together, so I can understand some of the concerns Joe had.

Present: Early in the year Levi had a poor slip of judgement and emotionally cheated on me with Zoe. I chose to forgive Levi but keep a close eye on him and Zoe since they are good friends.I have no problem with them talking and being friends now. All had been well until Joe started talking to me about Levi's and Zoe's relationship and how Zoe still had strong feelings for Levi. Now I already know that Zoe still likes Levi, it is very clear and I dont have a problem with it.

The things Joe kept sending me was more and more personal, and stuff I didnt need to know because it is none of my business. Well, when Levi found out about what Joe was doing, he was rightfully pissed, and when Joe found out that Levi was pissed, he got pissed too. So Joe went on a long rant telling me that my relationship was bad, and that Levi was just going to emotionally abuse me and cheat on me again. Joe then started talking to Alex, and they both came to the same conclusion that if Levi still talks to Zoey then he is pretty much is cheating on me. All of this caused me to have a minor breakdown because Levi and I have worked and talked through all of my/the issues with Zoe and we are on the same page now.

So now we have this huge mess and Levi is no longer friends with Joe, because he crossed the line, and I am contemplating my relationship with Alex because she never voiced any of these concerns with me, she went behind my back and talked to Joe about it.

He would go to his parents for money and bi-weekly they would give him $20 to $30 dollars which is just enough for gas. I would come and stay the weekends with them. While I was there I would cook for them. We would have to go to the store or we would attempt to go do something and I would always have to pay or he would be able to put up about $10. I was fine with it at first but as he began to get less and less it slightly became more annoying. In the 6 months we have been dating we have not gone on a single date or him paid for a single thing.

When I went back home for winter break which is far away from where I go to college and where my boyfriend lives he tells me that he dropped out of college. That he didnt put any effort into the semester and he failed. After he told his parents they were quite upset and his Mother began to cause mishap in our relationship. The fact that she knew we were having sex and having it quite often did not help. On the weekends I stay in his room and we share the same bed. 

As time progressed after I got back the time me and him would have together began to dwindle and his mothers anger began to increase due to the fact he doesnt have a job. Finally at the end of January his family sat down and said if he does not have a job by the end of the following month then there would be some changes. They stopped paying for everything entirely even though when I got back they wouldnt give him money. As the month continued he didnt apply to jobs until the week before the deadline. It caused alot of tension because I knew what was going to happen if he didnt have a job by then. Soon before the deadline was up he told me his parents are going to turn off his texting if he doesnt have a job which he did not treat as a big deal. Although I was going home soon to a broken home.

Now we are to today and he still does not have a job. His Mother has attempted to persuade both of us to break up with each other. Going to one of us and saying horrible things about the other and saying we shouldnt be together because his life isnt in order. She has requested we go out more and do things and we have done that but I pay for it. But then complains about how I pay for everything. She wouldnt pay for groceries or take into consideration the groceries he or I put onto the list. 

Last evening after spending a decent amount on groceries for a nice dinner for my boyfriend and I after I came back from spring break hell broke lose. I was attempting to stay a couple extra nights so we could catch up. I was cooking and he went to go ask his Mom if I could stay. Few moments before she was in a really good mood and was happy I had a couple more days off. I go to get him and ask him to help me cook and he gives me a look and I knew what that meant. She was pissed. Then she starts yelling about she is going to say what she wants and she comes into the kitchen. She starts off by saying she is going to get everything in the clear so then we all understand what is going on. 

She goes onto say that they have welcomed me into their home and have supported our relationship. That she has nothing against me but everything against my boyfriend because he isnt in school and still does not have a job. She continued to say that he doesnt live up to half of the expectations that his parents have for them. That we have sex and we know that she is not okay with it and yet we continue. That I need to stop paying for things because he has nothing to help me pay or to pay me back. She told me I better not pay for his gas or else. Her expectations constantly are changing. She doesnt give a damn about what is going on in her family unless she wants something. The fact that they are on a budget and she is going out and spending their money like candy is the problem. So now that they dont really have any extra money she wants them to get jobs to pay her so then she can uphold this habit. But to continue that things moved way to fast and now we are like a married couple. 

Now I cannot stay the weekends because he doesnt have a job and she is trying to put a stop to everything. She told him last week I couldnt spend the weekend and her reasoning why did not make any sense. She has shown no appreciation for the things I have done for her family and makes it sound like I am a burden to them. My boyfriend may have been lazy and didnt apply to jobs for months but he is still doing better then his little brother who is a drug addict. Which confuses me because she knows his little brother is doing it and dropped out of school and hasnt applied to a job yet and yet she acts all buddy buddy to him and doesnt talk to him about getting his life in order. She has been trying to put a wedge in our relationship since I have gotten back from being home. After she finished her lecture she asks me very rudely what I had to say and I almost lost it. I told my boyfriend that this was going to happen and he did not take what I had to say seriously but also looking for jobs seriously. Now we have reached the point where his Mom constantly comes up with an excuse to why he cant see me and tries to prevent it any way possible even though she says she supports us.

Hello /r/relationships! I've got a bit of a problem that I'm not sure how to approach or handle, and I would just like some insight on what would be the best course of action.

So my friend M(19f) and I went to high school together, and we not attend the same college and will be getting an apartment together next semester, which I am very excited for! She's one of the sweetest and most compassionate ladies I've ever met. She has a boyfriend, whom I will call A(19m), and they have been together for about 1 year and 3 or 4 months. 

M and I began to talk more over Christmas break and January, when we decided to room together, and we have lots of mutual friends. Whenever I would talk to our mutual friends about M in private, they always seemed to mention that her boyfriend doesn't really treat her right and they wish they would break up. 

Last Thursday, M and I had plans to get dinner together and catch up with each other. After we ate, we ended up going to the college chapel and sitting outside in the courtyard to talk. Over the course of the relationship, M revealed to me that:

- she and A had a tendency to fight a lot
- during those fights, A would insult her and wouldn't look at her
- A would always turn a problem she had that he was doing around so he could blame it on her
- M would end up crying and A would get mad at her and kick her out for crying, not let her touch him, or insult her even more (calling her a baby, a child, too emotional, etc.)
- after the fights he would ignore her for as long as he wanted to

And so on. So, A is being a total asshole and abusive to M, and this has been going on since month three. I remember she told me, when we first started dating, I thought the third month was bad. But it's nothing compared to how it is now. She also told me that once, when M wanted A to walk her to her car from the campus library, M told her she was a baby, she would be lucky if anyone wanted to rape her, and she was a bag of bones and was undesirable (M is very thin naturally). 
All of M's friends have told her she needs to break up with him, but she said she just can't and wants him to change. She also said she knows he won't change. She said she's afraid of being alone, that A makes her feel afraid of being alone. She told me she's unhappy and miserable, and he makes her feel like shit, and even when things are fine between them she's still unhappy. She also told me about how he never got her a gift on her birthday or Christmas, even with her getting him a $50 dollar gift for both occasions, and that for their one year anniversary, even though she was paying, he refused to go to the restaurant she wanted to and they ended up going to McDonalds. She was crying when she told me this. 

Now, for me, I would like to hear some input about how to approach the situation and comfort M and help her realize she deserves so much better than this. I told her about how my boyfriend and I handle conflict (calm discussions, maintaining physical contact so we are comforting each other even when we're peeved, always listening to the other person) in hopes to show her that how A treats her is NOT the norm, and she was actually genuinely surprised by what I said. I told her she deserves better, and that I understand it's harder said than done to leave (I've been in a VERY similar relationship), and have been trying to make plans with her more often so she doesn't have to be around him as much. What else can I do? Does anyone have any first hand experience with this kind of situation?

16110,Non-Romantic,2apltg,"My husband's brother (George) is in an emotionally abusive marriage (and I wouldn't be surprised if it is physically abusive behind closed doors).  They've been married for ~5 years, dating for a year before that.  She (~30F) has made him cry in front of his whole family on multiple occasions, makes him do absolutely everything for her and berates him if anything goes wrong at all, whether or not it is his fault.  I could write pages of the terrible things she does *in front of his whole family*, so I shudder to think about how she treats him at home.

My husband and his family have talked to George about the situation, but he gets very defensive if he thinks anyone is criticizing him or his relationship and just refuses to talk if anyone says anything too directly.  So the family has mostly settled for trying to show him that they're there for him whenever he needs support, and dropping comments here and there that aren't too direct in hopes of convincing him to leave sooner.

My issue is that, in the meantime, I cannot STAND to be around this woman.  I might be the least confrontational person on the planet, and yet when she starts yelling at him for something that is clearly not his fault, telling him how worthless he is, in the middle of a family gathering, I have a very hard time not saying anything. I have made several comments on a couple of occasions that border on calling her out, and I know that the more I have to be around the situation the harder it will be for me.  

However, calling her out in public would be counter-productive at this point, because George is not ready to admit that she is abusive and would most likely take her side.  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if she did not allow him to come to family events anymore, which would be a huge step back.  (She has done this in the past for short periods of time, and from what I can tell he just accepted it.)

I don't think that me avoiding her by simply not going to family events is a viable option - everyone else in the family are kind, generous people and my MIL and FIL would be genuinely hurt if I stopped attending.  Plus, I do want to show George that we are all there for him.

Does anyone have any advice about 1) how to convince George to leave the relationship (any kind of discussion would most likely come from my husband, not me - I'm just looking for tips to share with my husband), and /or 2) how to put up with having to see this woman at family events without causing a scene that would most likely end up pushing him away instead of helping?

Fast forward to today; my mum is driving me somewhere and I mention the gig to her, expecting nothing of it, however she tells me that it isn't ok for me to be going to a gig on a school night (writing that out feels so weird - this isn't the main problem haha!), especially in a year that matters so much in terms of my education - the grades I get this year play a large role determining which university I can go to. This is all fair enough. However the first problem that has arisen is that I've committed to buying a ticket to a gig that I now can't go to. We don't talk about it again until were back home with my Dad, a few hours later.

My Mum asks me if I've told Nathan I can't go to the gig yet - I haven't. My Dad is in the room and asks what were talking about, so I tell him that I've bought a ticket for a gig that I can't go to. His view is the same as my Mum's, apart from he also brings up the point that it was irresponsible of me to commit to something without passing it by my parents. This is also fair enough; I see entirely where he (they) are coming from. If it all stopped here, I would be ok with the outcome, except from a bit disappointed that I can't see a band I like and also that I would be letting a friend down by pulling out.

This is where it starts getting out of hand by my perspective. My Mum starts giving me other reasons why I shouldn't be going to this gig, some of which I felt like are straight up made up - almost like she's having to rationalise this more. I'm fine with not going - the reason she gave in the car was plenty. She tells me that she may have considered letting me go if I was (quote) a more well rounded person. This really got to me - sure, I don't help much around the house, but I try hard in school, keep fit, have a wide group of friends, and have hobbies. Telling me I'm not well rounded struck a nerve - I'm no basement dweller. I let it slide at first though - I didn't think it was relevant to reasons as to why I shouldn't be going to a gig. However she then asked about who I was going with; my friend Nathan. I tell her that Nathan goes to a lot of gigs. My Mum knows that Nathan is bipolar, and says something along the lines of you shouldn't be leading by his example - you'll end up being crazy like him. Entirely out of order - mental illness isn't something you can influence and going to gigs isn't going to make me fucking bipolar. She returns the topic to me - how comes he can hand in homework on time and you can't if he goes to so many gigs? This is entirely bullshit. I haven't handed in a late piece of work all year - I don't know where she's getting this from! I speak up against her, telling her that she's making up reasons as to why I shouldn't be going. School commitments would have been a good enough reason on its own - these other reasons aren't needed. She tells me that it was selfish of me to ask to go to a gig; I should know that its unreasonable of me to go to a gig during the week. My Mum also said that she didn't want to be up in the early hours of the morning worrying about where I am - she gets anxious very easily and often has anxious dreams about realistic stressful scenarios. My Dad joins in now - raises his voice in telling me I'm completely overreacting when I say this is turning into an attack on me. Oh yeah almost forgot - I have a ticket to see the Arctic Monkeys during half term, so my parents are cool with me going, but now I don't really want to go after this experience. Just seems like too much hassle.

Later that evening, still indignant about being told I'm not well rounded (:P), I thought about our discussion when I was in the shower. This may be total over-thinking, but the majority of my hobbies over the years have been killed by the need to work harder at school. I did drama classes from the ages of 5 to 15 for 3 hours every saturday.I made some money through adverts and film. I loved it. I had to stop to see a maths tutor for an upcoming exam. I never did drama (or act) ever again. I played for a football (soccer) team for a year. Parents advised me to stop playing to keep up with school work, so I did. I've been having guitar lessons for two years - these were cancelled this week so I can concentrate on my upcoming exams. My Dad, my Brother and I have been going to Arsenal games since I can remember. Recently my Mum has said that isn't smart that we go to so many games, especially weekday matches which end up with us getting home late. See a pattern here? I'm going to end up with nothing to do for fun!

NB - I think its unfair to say my parents are purposely killing my hobbies - they want me to do well at school. But how do I keep hobbies going?

So, this leaves me overall with a few key problems that I need your help with, hivemind.

-	What should I do with the ticket? Obviously I should pay Nathan the £20 he paid for me to go, but what then? Just absorb the cost? Scalp the ticket? What?
-	What should I say to my mum? Anything? Nothing?
-	How do I keep my hobbies going?

haha this turned into a bit of a rant didn't it. I just want a bit of perspective for problems that seem quite light hearted compared to some things I read on here - thanks bros.

16154,Non-Romantic,31bqwr,"I've been working as a server at a restaurant for 3 months. It's been going well, I'm saving money now instead if losing it and I like almost everyone I work with. Like most servers, working at this restaurant was never part of my long-term plan.

So, I goofed. I heard back from my dream school last week and found out I got accepted with full funding and a stipend. I am very relieved and excited, so I told all my friends, including my manager at work who I like and get along with quite well. He seemed surprised but pleased for me, although he did say he'd be sad to see me go in September. Normal stuff.

Yesterday, my manager asked me to step outside with him for a moment. He said that because I would be leaving them in September, he had to give some of my more lucrative shifts to someone with long-term potential at the company, and he hoped I would understand. This change involves cutting back my hours and moving me off our biggest earning day, Saturday, when I can take home 3x as much in tips as I would on a weekday. 

I sort of mutely accepted this at the time, but as I've thought about it more I've become more upset. I calculated and this means me taking home about $300 less/month, a big deal for a server. I realize it probably wasn't a good move to tell them I'd be leaving so far in advance, but keep in mind no one who works here wants to be here long term and everyone (including my manager!) Is just waiting for their big break in their industry so they can leave. In the brief time I've worked there 5 people have quit, 2 without notice, and 1 person has been fired. During this chaotic time I covered dozens of shifts w/o complaint. So it never occurred to me that 6 months of notice would be a deal breaker for them. I also feel like I'm being punished for my honesty, which seems unfair.

I know the restaurant business isn't about fairness though. My question is, should I fight this? Do I have a leg to stand on? Another suspision of mine is that the restaurant owner, who seems to dislike me for some reason, put my manager up to this, in which case I'm worried it's hopeless.

Tl;Dr: I told my manager in a moment of naïveté that I'd be leaving the company to go to grad school in September, and they cut my hours quite a bit, even though people leave the company all the time without any notice.

16156,Non-Romantic,37gga5,"Unique situation for me. Good friend for 10+ years. Traveled several times, got drunk many times, hung out in lots of contexts.  The last 1.5 years, we worked fairly close on a project together. More building / refurbishing than anything business-like.


Around February, I completed the bulk of my work to the project. All the tasks I had expertise in — or that we could collaborate on — were done. The remaining tasks were in his area. Since February, I've heard progressively less from my friend. He had to work outside the city for a few weeks. In April, he went on vacation. 


Since he came back, we haven't met or talked at length. At the beginning of May, he sent a few text messages saying he was back from vacation and making some random jokes. A few days later, when I asked him to call and touch base, he went dead quiet. I followed up 10 days later, still no response.  It's obvious this guy has dropped the ball on the work he was supposed to do to finish our project. Rather than have a frank conversation about it, he's also gone completely AWOL... 


I left him a voicemail Sunday night, saying his recent disappearance is a blow to our friendship. Out of respect for the decade we spent having each others' backs, I asked him to take 10 minutes and return my call. Still nothing.  I'm finding it difficult to let this roll off my back. I have experienced other people flaking out, letting me down or dropping out of contact before... but almost exclusively in the context of dating girls in my twenties. (That was a long time ago, to be fair, and they were young, attractive women who didn't owe me any loyalty or mature behavior.)


I have never experienced a longtime friend disappearing — particularly after dropping the ball a project we'd put almost 2 years into... without any apology or direct conversation about it.  I'm finding my reaction to this behavior is very primal. I wouldn't be nearly as upset if my friend just called me, explained some reasons why he wasn't a good person to depend on right now, and basically said sorry for letting me down.  He is still posting random jokes and updates about going drinking on social media, so there is no possibility he lost a loved one / got fired / or anything so traumatic it would justify freezing out his friends.


The cowardice of him avoiding all contact, like a flaky 20-something valley girl, is upsetting to me. My instinct is to confront him, and make him take responsibility for ruining an activity that I've sunk almost 2 years into.  I'm really bothered by the feelings of frustration, disrespect and disloyalty this stirs up. I have left him one short, calm voice message, saying I would appreciate us talking like adults, so we can each confirm where we're at...


Assuming he doesn't return my call, we'll be left with a 10-year friendship, a variety of mutual friends, and 2 years of wasted effort sunk into a project I can't rehabilitate on my own.  What do you think is the best way to handle this?  I don't mean what's the zen, high-minded way to handle it, either. I mean: how should a no-bullshit adult man react to being disrespected and screwed over by a longtime friend?


Everyone's comments are welcome. Thanks in advance.

Things are going downhill with me and my friends. Since we all started our internships (we are in our last year of college), they have become distant.

Especially towards me. I'm doing a special internship at a big company. Nothing special about that, if it was not for the fact that I'm working for my own startup with the guidance of that company. There are even some contracts that says that all the IP I create, belongs to me.

You could say that I'm seeing ghosts, but since previous year, when I announced that I'm working on a startup with help of our college and a few other companies, my friends didn't believe me and even ridiculed me. It was only when I got special privileges from college, like being able to skip classes, postpone exams and getting in special workshops and courses, that they understood that I'm serious.

And now my internship is halfway over, I'm getting ignored and don't even get invited to tag along to parties. I talked to one of my friends, who is doing his internship outside of the country, and he said that I might give them the feeling that I don't like to hang out with them. (I always come online to talk to them, but leave afterwards because I'm way too tired.) He wasn't sure if that was the reason, because he is abroad and didn't talk to them a lot either.

Right now there is this huge elephant in the room because I and 2 other friends were not invited for a party (we always go together) and no one wants to tell us why. They even went so far to send us drunk pictures from the place they were at. I tried talking about it and asked where they went and if there is something wrong but the question just gets ignored. 

This all sounds childish and trivial, but for me it is a big deal because I never had a lot of / zero friends and now when things get bad, I want to know why. And more importantly, how to deal with it.

Have been best friends with Anne since we started school. We're late 20's now. Anne doesn't deal with her emotions well and completely avoids issues or takes anger out on others. Over the course of the last 20 years, Anne has at several point (3 or 4 times in total) temporarily ended our friendship. Each time, she did it passive aggressively by just ignoring me until she was over her issue. All the while, I try to make amends and apologise and beg and basically act like a sap. She never tells me what I did wrong, she just leaves me in the dark. I think she takes offence very easily at times. So she's temperamental when it comes to me (because we're so close? I don't know). 

Anyway, Anne and her boyfriend Barry, who's also a friend of mine, broke up about 15 months ago. They had dated for about 6 years, and everyone thought they were going to get married. She broke up with him pretty much out of the blue as far as everyone was concerned. They were doing long distance, and she just got tired of it. Because she's SUCH a private person, it was a shock even to me, and I still barely understand why she did it. 

Since then, she has been pulling away from me more and more. We live in different countries, but used still talk regularly. She hasn't let me in to anything personal in at least a year. I mean, she won't even tell me (or anyone, to clarify) if she's dating someone. So I've felt that our relationship has been really suffering. Things have been strained, to say the least. I'm an open book and I really struggle to relate to her these days because there's no depth to our friendship any more. 

Anyway, in September, I met Barry briefly for a coffee when he was home. He told me he was seeing someone new. I was delighted, because words can't even describe how heart broken he was when the relationship ended, so I'm SO happy for him that he's found happiness again. 

He was worried about how to tell Anne. When he first told me, I thought I'd just tell her so she knew straight away. But then, because our friendship is so shallow these days, the opportunity never came up and the time passed where I could say it. 

Last month, I met Carol, Anne and my other closest friend. I told Carol about Barry because I didn't know what to do (tell Anne or wait for Barry to do it), and we agreed that she needed to know, but that Barry should tell her because it wasn't our place. I texted Barry and asked him to tell her ASAP, which he agreed to. 

In the end, he didn't tell her until last week. I know because he texted me to let me know. Next, I got a message from Carol saying Anne had rung her to ask if she knew. Carol had panicked and said we'd heard a rumour but didn't want to say anything in case we were wrong. 

Anne texted me, and she was FURIOUS. She felt I'd betrayed her A) by not telling her about Barry, and B) by speaking to Carol first. I tried to explain that I did what I thought was best, and I sincerely apologised if she felt I'd betrayed her. She insisted I should have told her, and then cut contact. 

I haven't heard from her since then. She's fine with Barry and Carol, but I'm getting all the blame. It's totally unfair. I'm 100% sure of my actions - I did what I thought was best. I haven't chased after her at all this time, and part of me thinks the friendship is over. The way I see it is, if she doesn't trust that I think I did the right thing, then there's not much of a friendship there anyway. If she does believe me, then she has no reason to be angry. But I'm afraid I'm being stubborn and throwing away a 20+ year friendship. (As I write that, I realise that if I'm doing that, then so is she.) Basically, should I try apologising/explaining myself again or should I just leave it and accept that the friendship could well be over?

16176,Non-Romantic,1wzqun,"First, some background.

The three areas that have affected my family’s life most intensely were religion, cultural identity, and extended family structure.  Our family went to a strict, ethnic Pentecostal church which supported speaking in tongues, prophecy, and other spiritual gifts.  It was also isolationist, even with respect to other ethnic Pentecostal churches in its own region.  It also mandated conservative dress codes including women having to wear head coverings.  It forbade celebrating birthdays or even wearing any sort of jewelry.  There was a continuous cycle of each mini-generation of kids growing up, getting forced to take leadership roles in the church, getting disillusioned while in college and leaving the church.  This left the ranks of “youth” in the church very thing usually.

Our family is from an area of SE Asia which was heavily impacted by Christian missionaries over the centuries.  I would argue that whatever traditional cultural identity we had was stripped away by people wanting to become “separate” and more purely Christian.   In general, everyone seems to be very sexually repressed and dating isn’t allowed.  Anecdotally, most people are stubborn and don’t seem to be able to agree to a common goal, as seen by the many church splits and divisions that I’ve witnessed.

Finally, our family structure and history has really influenced some of the problems I face today.  My grandma and grandpa (on my dad’s side) ended up having a ton of kids.  Grandpa died before I was born of a heart attack and apparently he smoked which may have contributed to it.  Grandma raised 11 kids on her own and helped them immigrate, so she tended to be very controlling but sharp and capable.  An unconfirmed rumor came out during my childhood that she had performed some “Hindu witchcraft” involving a chicken or something which my Mom fixates on to this day which I’ll get to later.  Another rumor I heard stated that my Grandma forced my parents to abort one of my siblings which was also unconfirmed.  Besides that, having a large family and uneducated kids, my Grandma ended up marrying them all off to more educated women nurses from her homeland.  This led to a weird power dynamic in most families where they guys tried to assert their dominance but didn’t earn the majority of the income in the household.  This also led to financial mismanagement and a lot of debt for some families.

In this situation, I grew up as a nerd in school.  I was pretty introverted because my parents didn’t let me do anything or meet up with friends.  I somehow managed to go away to school, got enlightened, and became much more well-adjusted and social.  I moved away for work at a high-stress job, but I eventually found my way and I’m doing alright now.  My mom prophesied once that I should marry a girl that I met, and that completely sabotaged my relationship and thinking for a long time.  I swung to the opposite and end started resenting my upbringing for a while, but I guess now I would consider myself an agnostic.

My younger brother started off following the same track but was interested in med-school.  He was very smart, but also introverted.  While he was in his more formative years in high-school, I was gone to work and the church our parents went to had very few kids his age.  He began to hang out with kids much younger than him, almost regressing in a way.  My mom was very overbearing spiritually, and she would force him to pray and take him to prayer meetings where self-proclaimed prophets would tell people what “God wanted to say to [them]”.  One of them prophesied to my brother that he was supposed to go to med-school.  He ended up going away to college, but when he went he started manifesting symptoms of OCD that were related to religion.  Specifically, he felt like he was going to hell anytime he committed a perceived sin.  At the same time, he was yelling at my parents, punching holes in the walls, and going crazy any time he came home.  He got super violent and hit my mom at some point.  My parents caved a bit and had him taken to the psych ward where they had him under observation and had him see a psychiatrist.  They started him on medication.  Turns out the psychiatrist was our same exact ethnic group and sort of a jerk but my parents never asked for another one.

A little later, he ended up going to a church on campus that continues to absorb his entire life.  He began to doubt if med school was for him.  A couple of cousins and I really helped him put together his med school essays and he literally didn’t apply, instead going on a missions trip with his church the very next day and turning off his phone on purpose so we couldn’t reach him.  

This got worse when he applied to another med school and got denied from this one.  At this point he gave up on the whole thing, blaming my mom that it was her and the prophets fault for this not working out.  He would miss class constantly because he was either having a religious episode where he felt as though he was condemned or he didn’t feel motivated to go to class.   It turns out that when I urged him to ask the med school he was rejected from as to why it didn’t work out, they stated that his recommendations were weak.  This made sense since he missed so much class for key courses that he needed good recommendations from.  Furthermore, it seemed that he was sleeping in a ton because he took on significant roles at this church and was there all the time instead of prioritizing school.  I felt like this church was manipulative and it tends to prey on the weak-minded and socially inept.  My brother even cited examples of kids that sort of lost their will to succeed in school because they got distracted.  This is while their parents are footing the bill for school.  My dad paid for about 80% of his undergrad tuition out of pocket because he didn’t want to leave him strapped with significant loans after med school.  

Coincidentally, my brother also “committed” for 2 years to this church under the request of their pastor.  A lot of other people who have went to this church jokingly call it a cult, but honestly it shares some characteristics.  I saw a guy at his church slap him on the webcam while I was watching.  I asked him about it afterward and he said he has Asperger’s as if that was some sort of excuse.  He goes on mission trips regularly with this church and begs for funds which really disgusts me.  

He also has failed over and over again despite every type of resource.  Before his current job, my mom got a research job that my mom hooked him up with and he was late for the meetings and ultimately just quit on the first day, pissing off his would-be boss.  He barely graduated after almost failing a class or two in his last semester.  In fact, the day he graduated, he got pissed off during a conversation in our car and started punching my mom.  We had to stop at a local restaurant, he jumped out of the car and walked around randomly for 30 minutes trying to cool down.  My mom was afraid for her safety.  Me and my dad were like WTF.  He barely graduated and now is earning about $10/hr at some sort of a charter school.  

My parents still support him here and there when he ccan’t make the rent with his roommates (from church, of course).   Whenever he comes home, we all have to walk on eggshells because we’re not sure if asking him about his future will set him off.  He’s on medication but he won’t go see a therapist because the last one he went to was a Buddhist and he was afraid she’d “lead him astray”.  I asked him to go to a Christian therapist and even then he is dragging his heels.

My dad offered to try to support him in some capacity if he goes back to school to get a higher paying career.  My brother responded by saying he wanted to get a masters in teaching for special education which has a median salary of 50k.  This probably means his entry level salary is even lower….I admire the passion but I do think that he is selling himself short.  Besides all that, I wish he’d figure out his mental health stuff before trying to pick a long-term career.

Now, onto my mother.  She leads a bible-study at work where a lot of people seem to have come under her charismatic sway.  They have no idea how she really acts at home.  She proselytizes constantly at work and sometimes gets in trouble but has never been fired because of it.  She does next to nothing at work which is why she gets away with running a lunch-time bible study.

For some background on her family, she grew up a devout catholic who converted in nursing school by some hardcore Pentecostals who believed in prophecy and other gifts.  She then converted the rest of her family to Pentecostalism.  Some second-order effects of this was that they were ostracized by even their own family socially and even financially, causing them to go into debt.  This caused her mother to pray really hardcore.  Her mom died at 50 and her dad died soon after.  Her much younger siblings were left rudderless and had to fend for themselves until they somehow immigrated.  Consequentially, they aren’t exactly flourishing either.  

At home, she displays a lot of weird behaviors.  She:

-	rationalizes that anytime anyone gets angry at her antics, its because of a demon so she proceeds to rebuke it, further enraging the angry person.  
-	has a “network” of similarly minded “prophetesses” all throughout the country who call her and she calls back about these sorts of issues.
-	cancelled my dad’s prescription once for medication and told my brother to pray in order for his teeth to get straightened
-	Lies about where she’s going to my dad to go to prayer meetings, deletes texts and voicemails from her phone
-	believes in demons and actively believes that unless she fasts 14 days at a pop, they’ll take over our family
-	hid illnesses from us (had ovarian cysts she was getting checked out)
-	doesn’t go to the doctor almost at all
-	prophecies constantly to people who call her asking for her prayer
-	speaks at church constantly and speaks in tongues during messages, disturbing others around her and preventing people from hearing the pastor
-	believes that my grandma put a curse on us and that is why any bad thing happens to us
-	incessantly guilt trips me for not going to church when she wants.  
-	wakes up at ungodly (ha) hours to pray and speak in tongues and “worship” because according to her, without this fervent intercession, our family will be doomed.
-	manipulates people to get angry using enraging tactics like insulting my dad’s mom or telling me that I’ll grow up to beat my wife like my dad.  Once you get angry, she then uses that as  proof that you are possessed by a demon brought on by my grandma’s curse.
-	Anytime my dad goes to my Grandma’s house, she interprets any change in behavior as her effect.
-	She doesn’t eat or drink anything from her house and actually called her possessed within earshot of everyone at church.
-	Among many other things.


Finally, my dad.  Dad used to be abusive husband about a decade ago but that has stopped.  He has had a variety of health problems but luckily they haven’t really stopped him from doing anything.  

My dad is super conservative and would almost rather be separated than get divorced.  He is afraid of the reputation of our family as well as what that would do to his kids marriage prospects.  He also is somewhat in denial about my mom’s mental issues.  His workload is pretty high, he’s in a lot of debt, and he is a diabetic so all this stress from my brother and my mother is getting to him.  On the workload bit, he owns a business that deals constantly with people from our community.  This forces him to wear a mask in front of everyone while our family is rotting from the inside. 
 
Now, lets fast forward to today.  Recently, my mom told my dad that she doesn’t want him around so she can freely invite people over to our house and have prayer meetings, essentially saying in a passive way that she wants a divorce.  This sort of crushed my dad and he doesn’t know what to do. My mom has never said anything like this and it seems like her enraging nonsense is getting crazier and crazier. I don’t know how to help. I’ve tried to get him to figure out his finances first so he can then deal with this situation at home, but it's tough since they are so interconnected. He definitely isn't/wasn't a perfect husband, but the situation at our house seems to be getting out of control. My mom was yelling and screaming at him today about why he doesn't want to put a ""fasting"" prayer meeting at our house so my brother pulls his head out of his ass. What do I do?

16190,Non-Romantic,1pszja,"I desperately need some advice:

My mother has been with my father for over 35 years (since highschool). My father is a car salesman who was extremely successful in his early years decades ago. 

Now, we've been through some hard times. For the past few years, my father has been attempting to achieve the same susses he had in his youth selling cars and fixing them. He has been avoiding getting a job for years in order to work as a self-employed mechanic/seller with little susses. This has caused day to day uncertainty as we don't know if he's going to get paid from one day to the next. He is somehow scared of being on a company's payroll and working 9 to 5 with a guaranteed check. 

My mother doesn't work because she home-schools my two siblings, and the fact that she doesn't trust the local school system due to their treatment of kids who are behind. 

So there is only one breadwinner in the household. What angers me is that we wouldn't be in this situation if he was responsible and got a *real* job and not be so infinitely stubborn. There are times where we were hours from having utilities turned off due to late payments because he attempts to wait it out until the very last second. He has not gotten his drivers license renewed in 4+ years just because.. He doesn't go to the doctor, even after a life threatening hernia infection forced him to be *forced to go* to the hospital, and tries his damnedest to talk us into not going unless we have stab wounds or something. We never celebrate holidays unless my mother does. He doesn't find the need to work on the house that's falling apart, not even my mother's car (he's a master mechanic). We would have to take out a pipe and have the kitchen sink water drain into a bucket that me or mother would have to carry out every day, and he would'nt fix it for weeks, but he would jump out the window for someone who has a car for him to fix, or is willing to give him pocket change for hours of labour. Not even basic insurance, he's too *old* for that type of labour, yet he keeps doing it. 

When I bring up these things to him, I always got the same Im trying to make this work, just one more day. You still have food, you're eating, right?. There have been days where we had to ask for food from our neighbor because some *guy* wasn't able to stop by to pay him that day. He works for shitty wages whenever the person he's working for is willing to pay him. He could easily get a senior-level job anywhere in the auto industry if he wanted to, but he doesn't. He wants the freedom of being self-employed. He is just irresponsible and it has caused my mother huge amounts of greif over the past few years, aging rapidly due to stress, anger and depression to the point that she is a different person from when my siblings were born.

We live in our deceased grandmother's house, the fact that we're living essentially for free and still struggling angers me greatly.

I feel that he is taking advantage of the fact that he is the breadwinner currently and that he has a inheritance on his hands. He has become sexually frustrated with my mother since she thinks that he doesn't deserve sex because of how irresponsible he is. So some nights he tries to force himself on her (he has the backwards notion that as the man of the house, she's required to have sex with him). When she refuses he goes outside yelling profanities and insults at my mother where everyone can hear because he knows she hates that, and sits in his car like a child. She feels like he gets turned on by the younger women at work, then comes home hot and bothered ready for sex that night. However, my mother feels trapped because what is she going to do, leave him and have him take the money with him, our key to a better life (which he's threatened to do)?  My two younger siblings need their father as well. Is she going to let them be yet another kid without a father in their life?

Im angry as hell because I know he can change, I know he can do better but he seems to just not care anymore and doesn't listen. He's gotten cynical and senile and I know that he's taking advantage of the situation because he knows he can. 

I want to change him, but I think he's stuck in his ways and I cant talk to the rest of the family about this because they secretly look down upon us because of him.

I need advice, I need help!

I think my best friend is becoming distant towards me which i started to notice a year ago, it becoming more and more obvious over time. He doesnt ignore me but i think he just doesn't value the time spent together. Old habits started to bother him, and he made me completely ignore them. 

I've noticed that we spend 2x less time than we used to, which kinda bothers me and let me to the post. It isn't the time spent that bothers me, but the impression that it goes out with me just to somehow keep-up with the relationship and not give up on it. Often he does question me on the exact purpose of going out because apparently not having an exact plan or idea doesn't look good to him.



Nothing happened during the last year that could have made him change, no major life changes, nothing. He does have a few friends (school), but those are mutual friends and only. He rarely goes out with them when i am not there, and neither do i which probably makes them common-only friends if i could tag them this way. He has no girlfriend which he'd have to dedicate time to, neither do I ATM but when i had one, i never prioritized her and explicitly showed him this.

 I do have quite a few friends (we study at different places) but i clearly showed / said him that he's my best friend and i value our friendship the most (not sure i heard the same from him). We used to hang out when we had free time which was like 2 times / week (wasn't regular every week), which seems ok to me.



I thought about easing up a bit because he might have become bored of me and wanted to get to know his friends better or idk, but this proved up to not be the case as he's either out with me (+ friends) or at home.
 Everything is fine at his place, pretty sure of this, and am also sure that he doesn't have any secret project or work he's spending time on as we're both developers working on one thing.

Okay so me and two roommates moved into a house in May. We (for some reason) expected the electricity bill to be around $60 a month. After all three of us were settled in, we had a roommate meeting to discuss things (like dishes, cleaning, just whatever). The thermostat came up, we disagreed on that greatly. Roommate A and me wants it to be reasonable, around 72-74 degrees. (To give context, we live in Columbia, SC and the temperatures here have been in the 105s lately...)


Roommate B became furious. She said we were ridiculous. She wanted it to be at 85 degrees....Her reasoning is that 1. because it is cooler than the outside temp and 2. She lived in Brazil for two months and sometimes didnt have AC at all and was fine. We argued for a while but ultimately decided on 75. She has been very passive aggressive about this since then. Always complaining how cold it is, comments like I can't believe I need to use a blanket in the summer, etc. Ultimately, she was just outnumbered.


Our first bill came for half of may and it was Like $30. So we just assumed a full month would be around $60. Awesome.


The bill we got today was for $190. Roommate B is again furious. She want's to put the thermostat at 80. Me and Roommate A are always sweating in the house and its so uncomfortable. We both avoid being home during the day. We are a lot more active. (Roommate B is home a lot, just laying around all day. Of course you would be cooler doing nothing as opposed to moving around a lot.) Also, my room is the only part of the house in the sun and is almost unbearable during the day.

I went on anti-depressants this year, prescribed by my physician, and they have helped me dramatically. I am so much happier and more energetic these days. I mentioned this is passing once and she freaked out and still brings up how they are terrible, the pharmaceutical company and doctor are just ripping me off, they'll turn me into a walking zombie, etc. I tried to explain to her that depression is an actual physical illness that sometimes requires medication, and then she started telling me that I just wasn't motivated or trying hard enough to be happy, to try just being happy, going to church, or taking some herbs. She'll bring this up constantly.


This is not the issue so much as today she found out through my sister that I recently quit my desk job in media buying to become a personal trainer at a luxury gym.

I started my new part time job a few months ago as a transfer within my company. It's more or less the perfect job for me, with the exception of my coworker, who we'll call Jill. Jill is a 50 or so year old woman who came in a 2 weeks before me. I have a lot of problems with Jill, namely that she gossips a lot. Honestly, my problem that she says unnecessarily cruel and rude things to not just me, but also my leads. She has said things ranging from I'm lazy and she deserves more money than me because she's such a hard worker (lol nope, and this is extra insulting considering I've been with the company for 3 years) to she doesn't think my coworkers deserve their jobs because they already have other jobs, and she can't wait until this one lady's diabetes gets worse so she can't work and she (Jill) can move up on the priority ladder. To complicate things more, her son is a lead and he tells her a lot of confidential information, which she leaks to literally everybody else into the department.  She had already said a lot of other generally terrible things to my coworkers as well, so under their encouragement, I went to my managers. They talked to Jill, who then more or less threw a really dramatic tantrum about betrayal and backstabbing and how she is so unloved in this department and whatever, and how whoever complained about her should have left her son out of it.


I think she suspected that I was the one who said something, because from then on she was just civil to me and wouldn't sit next to me which worked out well for me. I can deal with that, especially because I don't want to hear her gossip anyway! But over the last few days, she has gotten increasingly hostile. She won't talk to me at all, and now when I'm talking to another coworker, she'll run up behind me and pretend to shoot or hit me in the head. She also will do this weird passive aggressive inside joke thing with my other coworkers while they're around me and when I ask what the problem is, they both shrug and say it's nothing.  I have to work with her a few times this week, and I seriously considered calling in sick so I won't have to deal with her. Then I get mad I'm thinking like that, because some lady who acts like she's a teenager shouldn't be disrespecting me and intimidating me from going to my job.

16255,Non-Romantic,25tyjh,"Okay so a little back story, this is my senior year in high school and I am just about to head off to college. This year I met the most fantastic girl. She's smart, funny, cute, and awkward in that adorable way. She's in three of my classes this year so I got to see her a lot. We became somewhat good friends and I talked to her a lot. My conversations with her are some of the best I ever had. It seemed like we never ran out of things to say. I developed quite the crush on here rather fast.

Things got bad when I decided to act on those feelings. I decided it was either now or never and asked her out (over the computer like a fucking whimp, a decision I still really regret). She turns me down and suddenly things are very awkward between the two of us, which is fine. I gave her some space for the next few weeks because I figured she didn't want to be talking to the guy she rejected too much, especially at the high school level.

I figured though I still really wanted to be her friend, regardless of whether or not she rejected me. I began slowly talking to her more and more and, after a few days of awkward small talk, began to work my way back up to about where we used to be. Sounds good right? Well, not really.

By about where we used to be I mean she still talks to me and isn't completely avoiding me like she was after the first few days, but she's giving off some really mixed signals. It's confusing the hell out of me. Basically, she decideds to be nice and talks to me SOMETIMES. The other 50% of the time, she just glazes over when I try to speak to her. I wouldn't mind the latter if she did it consistantly, but she keeps switching between trying to get my attention every 10 minutes to mildly annoyed.

Just today for example, after our senior rally had ended, I began to walk with my friends back to class. She calls me over and sounds rather happy to see me. We talk a bit about the rally and I get her to laugh at a joke about our AP Gov class. She even hands me her bubbles that all the seniors got (we were supposed to blow them simultaneously and create a bubble storm during the rally which was pretty cool). Then suddenly, two periods later, she's back to being slightly displeased at my presence. I walk up to her, still expecting her friendly demeanor from just hours earlier, and she glares at me. She gives one word answers to the questions I ask her and completely ignores me when I say goodbye.
What's making me confused/mildy frustrated is the inconsistency. If she never wanted to talk to me again that would be fine, but she keeps getting my hopes up and dash them. Every. Single. Day. Like seriously, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

16271,Non-Romantic,34kfu5,"I'm of Hispanic descent and my parents were always very strict. My mom always hit us if we disobeyed, spilled something, talked back, basically anything that pissed her off. She never discussed the issues or explained why, she just did. I know it sounds awful but my mother was raised the same way by her adoptative mother (her aunt). 




I, on the other hand, have always been a rebellious child. I have always spoken back and it's always been a need to defend myself or to explain. I was also just very bratty and self entitled. I'm the middle of three girls so you can say I have middle child syndrome. I never really got along with my sisters that well. We always fought over stupid things like toys or not picking up after yourself. When my mom would hit me I would talk back or yell. I've never laid a hand on my mother when I was young. 




After my parents divorce, my attitude got worse and I was really mean to my mom. Of course she would beat me and I feel like throughout my teenage phasee I lost my sisters trust, support, and respect. They saw how me and my mom would fight and they always turned on me. I would get so mad I would lash out at them. I blame myself for that and wish I wasn't such a horrible teenager. 




Basically, every fight my mom has always beaten me or said very nasty, hurtful things to me. So I've tried to distance myself from my family because my sisters always blame me and tell me that I am the problem, that I don't respect anyone or anybody. I have tried to apologize for my behavior, for being irrational, for causing fights and to pretty much tell them that I'm not that child anymore. I'm trying to get better but I feel like the damage was done and they don't try much with me.




As I got older, I've noticed a really terrible pattern. My mom is only nice to me when she wants or needs something. She asks me for money when she doesn't have any and I give it to her because she's my mom. My dad hates my Mom because a lot of personal issues but one of them being that she hits us and asks us for money. So today we got into a very bad argument (I should've held myself together) because she tells me I do nothing and do not provide for the house. All this trash talk about me not buying food when I do buy groceries for the house or give her money to help out with groceries. She has this ego thing where she can't admit that I help out and I honestly do it to get in her good graces but it's hard when she denies it. I've tried my hardest to get in her and my sisters good graces but no success. We fight and I say really nasty things to her, call her a stealer, a liar... All this stuff I shouldn't have said and she started beating me. She punches, pulls my hair, hits me with a stick, kicks me. This is the point where I had it, I got up and went at her like I was going to hit her but didn't. I pushed her away but she only hit me harder. Yes, I made an attempt to scare her by making pretend I was going to fight back but now she's claiming I hit her. I called my dad and he called the cops who ended up showing up and my mom started blaming me that I started the fight and that she needed to hit me. Nothing happened other than now my sisters hate me and my mother is heartbroken by how I am. 




I really told myself over the years that I deserve it because I have a bad mouth but I only speak or talk to defend myself or to prove my point but to no avail. I just don't understand why my mom still hits me at 24, why her ego gets in the way, why can't they let me grow up from that awful person I use to be? I guess I blame myself for everything because my sisters never come talk to me, they see it as you've always been like this and it crushes me because I do everything and anything just for them to give me chance to change, to not be so mean, to defend, help or protect me, to talk to me when this stuff happens. I run to my dad because I feel like he's the only person he cares even though I'm causing more harm than good. 




I have bruises now but I guess I looked for it. I just wish my mom talked to me and offered solutions rather than belittle and beat me. I love mom to death because she's a good person, she works hard, she has given me everything in this world. I wish I could make this go away.

16279,Non-Romantic,3el4oe,"My employee, Sarah, is an awesome employee. She works really hard and goes above and beyond when working. She organizes everything and does a lot the things that I hate doing. She is also super outgoing with customers.

The down side of Sarah is that she can never cover me or switch shifts. She normally will work 12 hours a week, in 4 hour shifts. It doesn't matter if I tell her 2 weeks beforehand that I need to switch shifts, she can never do it. She will fill out our work calendar with the dates she is working so that it fits around her schedule. She is suppose to work from 10-6 on Friday, Sunday, Monday but almost never does. She does work 12 hours no matter what, but just randomly through the week.

This Monday I had a meeting out of town. So I let her know before the schedule was written, two weeks before my meeting, that we need to maintain the normal schedule on Monday because I have a meeting that morning. She said she isn't sure that is possible  because she watches people's animals and has to give them medicine at that time and will need to take my shift instead. So I asked her if she could see if it's possible and get back to me because it's an important meeting. The next day she says no via email.

Her is a copy of what she said:


Good morning Kiddo,
 
I have been trying to figure out a way to squeeze in this week but unfortunately I’m not able to with all the other work I already have scheduled as it's medication that has to be given at a specific time.  I knew that was going to happen. 
 
Kind Regards,
 
'Sarah' 



I can't even make plans or meetings because I don't know if I am working or not. There is no set schedule.
This has happened dozens of times.


 I don't want to lose her as an employee because A) she is an amazing worker. B) I don't want to hire someone else. I'm so busy right now, I can't imagine going through the hiring/training process at this time. And C) the reason she works so little is because she makes much of her living suing people. She gets a lot of money from her parents whom also sue people. A few months ago her mother sued Sarah's friend because the mother tripped on a rock outside his house. She also will only date extremely rich guys.

I'm going to add a couple things that also bother me about her...she calls me kiddo...I feel so weird being the supposed authority figure for someone that calls me that and is over double my age. It feels kind of demeaning. Another thing... You can't ask Sarah how her day is going. You better prepare yourself for a crazy ride if you do. She is CONSTANTLY sick. She has had everything under the sun happen to her. It's extremely draining to talk to her. Lastly, it was my 21st birthday last month and I asked if she could possibly take my shift so I could have the whole day off. She said yes! My first whole day off since easter!  I was stoked until I noticed that she cleared herself off entirely that week on the schedule so that it would be me everyday except my birthday. That was pretty sucky.

So...how can I reply to this girl and not be to pushy but  also be authoritative? I'm worried she will quit if I am too demanding... I am a shy, introverted girl. I've never been a social butterfly and have a very hard time talking to people especially in an authoritative way. I'm under so much stress lately, yesterday I actually had a fear something was going to pop in my brain because I had so much stress I felt stabbing pain randomly in my head while I was going through a million emails. I just need an occasional break and would love for her to give me one.

It would be much more stressful for her to leave and me find a new employee than for her to stay and me have a crappy, unpredictable schedule. 

I don't guys, I'm really new at this whole being a boss thing. I really would like some advice and support on how to deal with this situation. Thank you.

TL;DR I need help being authoritative, but not too authoritative, to my much older employee regarding an unstable schedule.

16282,Non-Romantic,36jgte,"Not really sure where to start with this one. I’m [22F] about to graduate – and with it be financially independent for the first time – and I’m moving in with my boyfriend of 6 months [24M] in a new city. This is an important time in my life, and I just want to reach out to people for advice about my relationship with my mum [60F]. It’s got to the point where my efforts to be friendly or have a conversation with her getting rebuffed are really getting me down, and I’m really losing my patience with her constantly treating me like a child – in a condescending, disrespectful way, not in that overzealous, caring way. I’ve tried multiple times to have conversations about our relationship and the things she does that hurt my feelings, but she simply does not care. I’m pretty sure she’s at least borderline abusive towards me, but just have no idea how to proceed in the relationship or make things better.

My relationship with her is totally non-existent. I can never remember us getting on. I was apparently a difficult baby who didn’t sleep or eat and she still seems weirdly resentful of this (probably in comparison to an older sister with who she has a pretty good relationship.) In addition to this, my puberty coincided with her menopause which made my relationship with her as a teenager absolute hell for my dad and us both. However, whereas I’m ready to look past this and try and re-establish some sort of relationship with her, she has made it clear she is totally uninterested. She will talk to me once every few weeks but there is no real interest in my life and trying to get a conversation flowing is like trying to get water from a rock. I don’t think we have a lot in common but she just has no desire to get to know me or know how I’m doing. I know I can’t spend any time at the family home anymore, as I always end up miserable from her yelling at me or being generally unreasonable or mean for no good reason. I can’t have friends over because she’s rude to them (ringing them taxis without asking as a hint for them to leave haha) and she is pretty blatantly horrible to my boyfriend when he’s one of the nicest people I have ever met.

Then there’s the fact that I spent last year studying abroad and she miraculously completely changed her attitude towards me and we started getting on really well. She wanted to talk to me at least weekly but often daily, she worried about me etc. I just thought we’d turned a page only to have us go back to square one almost immediately after I returned to the country. I thought for a long time that if I wasn’t to blame in all of this, then I was at least a big part, but after time and talking it through with people I kind of think I might have to give myself a break. My sister [30F] and I are in agreement that she probably has some sort of disorder, and whereas it effects the whole family I undeniably get the brunt of this. My mum’s relationship with my sister can be fraught, and my mum can be difficult, but my sister is generally my mum’s pride of joy and their relationship is immeasurably better than mine and my mums.

I can’t talk to her about any of this. Any time I’ve tried to calmly talk about her actions hurting me or wanting to make efforts to get on better she just calls me pathetic and dismisses anything I say, and then it will turn into an argument which is definitely not worth the aggravation. She won’t entertain the idea that she’s ever put a foot wrong and I’m sure she thinks all our problems are my fault. I’m tired of feeling like a burden. I’d love some advice as to how to proceed once I graduate and whether I should just keep communication to a minimum and meeting to Christmas.

Sorry if this is all over the place and longwinded. I’ll answer questions if clarity is needed. Thanks!

16287,Non-Romantic,1ye9vd,"One of my stand out memories of my childhood was my father found me watching porn one day when I was very young, 8 or  9 years old on the computer. I was looking at pictures of a female with a strap on banging a guy and when my father saw it, he went into a frenzy hitting me and telling me that it was wrong. Later he apologised saying that he thought I was looking at gay porn but realised it wasn't and said sorry for hitting me. I turned out to be incredibly open sexually from that point and though I am not bi-sexual had a huge defining moment on my drive to know more about sex in general.

I've never loved my father, but i've respected his ability to climb the corporate ladder as he's a very well respected and well known international VP of a top 50 Fortune 500 company. My parents are wealthy beyond belief, but I don't want to take their money and prefer to be broke - living in their house but with no real money to my own. My entire life he's wanted me to emulate him and his career, however as my path has diverged he's sort of given up on me, leading to disinterest whenever I try to talk about what I am passionate about. 

For the last decade I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, self-loathing at myself for being such a weak person within such a successful family, but today I found a document on my Mum's laptop that rocked my entire life.

She had problems with her email crashing, having done a degree in IT and knowing enough to fix most issues, I hopped on as she walked off and tried to clear caches, get rid of any draft emails and other things that might be clogging the pipes as it were. I found a draft email to the local church asking for assistance with her life.

The paraphrased summary of the draft email is that my father has been unfaithful for decades and she has stayed with him because of the family name, but also because of her own depression and lack of willpower. Further he's bi-sexual and for the last few years has been having affairs with men at business conferences. He's told her that he will stop having bi-sexual affairs but has told her that it's a part of his business acumen to secure deals by sleazy side-antics with other executives. Incredibly dispassionately I don't doubt it as he is pretty much single-handedly responsible for taking a company from the dust and turning it into a multi-billion dollar empire.

I am frustrated, confused and I don't know how I should approach this or if I should even mention it. My mother has kept this from the family for decades already and though I've guessed at my father's infidelity previously, I never realised how much she has gone through herself. Knowing that I know might hurt her more than I want to do, it would be a breach of trust and also is information I'm not sure I want them to know I know. My other siblings I am absolutely positive don't know about this.

What would you do in my situation? Confront my father? Console my mum? Do nothing and take it to my grave? I honestly have no idea but it's suddenly making me feel more worthless than I already did as the people who I considered aspirational in my life suddenly are ass holes and the things I hate about myself seem to be less than meaningless in comparison. I just feel like an ass hole for being sad. I hate that I found out because any respect I had for my father vanished and is now left with an emptiness that I don't know how to fill.

I'm new to therapy. Recently I've been going through a lot of things (my SO is in serious legal trouble for a crime he didn't commit, family issues stemming from that, a lot of general stress and anxiety). I decided to give therapy a try. I called a highly recommended place and they matched me with a therapist based on my age and issues. 

I've had two sessions with the therapist, who we'll call Margaret. I feel like she's a little.. grating sometimes. In my first session, she told me she wanted me to inventory what's going on for her. I listed a few things about my boyfriend's issues, mostly centering around his parents asking too much of me during this time. She interrupted me to say, Well, tell his parents to stop, then. I explained to her that I wasn't comfortable doing that and didn't know how to do it, which is why I was there. She responded with, Then don't complain.

I think this was a little rude.. she did ask about my problems, so it seemed a little rude that she then told me to stop complaining. But I thought maybe it's just a tough love scenario. So I kept going. I talked to her about how I haven't been eating much lately due to the stress, and she kind of looked to the side and said, Yeah, it shows. I thought this was kind of weird. Why would you point out someone looks too thin when they're insecure about the fact that they haven't been eating much?

My second session was weird, too. I told her that my SO has been very depressed and as a result, we haven't had much sex unless he initiates.. she told me I should withhold sex from him when he wants it to show him how it feels. This just didn't seem like an informed professional opinion to me.. I don't know.

There have been other little comments here and there. I've talked to a few people about it and the responses have ranged from, this is normal to you shouldn't see her again, so I wanted some insight from people that might have a better idea.

16304,Non-Romantic,28is9h,"My mother and I have always been very close.  I think a large part of this is due to the fact that I am an only child and she is a deliberately single parent (meaning there has never been a father in the picture but by her choice) so we are each the other's entire immedate family.  This also means that until I moved out a few years ago, we were the only ones the other had lived with for 20+years.

The problem I'm having is that my mother has always been nitpicky and controlling about weird, little things.  For example, she criticized the way I brushed my teeth, made scrambled eggs, and a lot of other odd, little things.  On top of that, when she's angry, she's passive aggressive.  I never thought too hard about that stuff until recently when my boyfriend (20m) and I had a really big fight in which we broke up and got back together.  He told me I was controlling and nitpicky.  Most of the time, I don't even notice.

Ever since I moved out a few years ago, I have noticed that my mom is increasingly annoyed when I can't hang out.  I'm not talking about if I cancel plans with her or I go several weeks without seeing her (we live about half an hour apart so we usually see each other a few times a week), but I mean if she asks me to hang out a certain time and I already have plans.  She wakes up much earlier than I do.  This means if I want to meet up at, say, noon instead of ten or eleven, she gets mad.  If I say I want to do something slightly differently than she wants (for example, taking separate cars to an event to which we were both invited when she wants to take one car) she needles me until either I give in to how she wants it or I get angry, which in turn makes her angry.

Lately (the past year or so) this has been what our entire relationship boils down to.  I used to love hanging out with my mother.  When it comes to the big stuff, she's fantastic.  Every break-up, every loss of a friend, every bad teacher, my mom was there to support me and look after me.  She's helped me through a lot of stuff and instilled a lot of good values.  As she's gotten older, though, I feel like she's gotten more and more bitter.  I dread hanging out with her.  I find if I spend more than a few hours with her, I come home tired and frustrated.  I want to talk to her about this, because she's not a bad mother.  I think it would do us both a lot of good to get this stuff out in the open.  I have no idea how to approach her, though.  There is a very good chance that she will get very angry and stop speaking to me for a long time and then when she does speak to me again, it'll be to admonish me for being selfish and nothing will change.

I pretend to be in a constant diet and I eat junk food alone. I eat very little and healthy in front of people, generally. I know is pathetic and that I have an addiction to food.



My father (58m) put some chocolate eggs in the table and I forgot about being fake. I started eating and I ate one small egg ( there were like 14 there). 



My mother (57f) started yelling and pointing out that I was eating that. Nobody listened to her or care, but she insisted until my brother and her girlfriend listened.



My brother started to call me by my old nickname (it is difficult to traslate, but something like Donut, a reference to food/my size). 



He started pointing out *who is eating the eggs, it is Donut, will she eat all the eggs?, well, she is Donut*.It was our childhood all over again. 



The worst part was that her girlfriend (27 f), who is overweight herself, started laughing like crazy. My brother kept making fun of me and both of them laugh a good 15 minutes about it. They were soo rude. 




My mother laughed a little and kept talking about it. Who was the one that did not laugh? The 15 year old. I convinced her to eat with us before because she was upset about the calories of the pasta. My mother pointed out her obsessions and she was ashamed.



My sis stopped eating the moment they made fun of me. She keeps losing weight and I am worried this all fat-shaming scenario will cause her an eating disorder.



Thank to my efforts and long talks, my sister stopped cutting, smoking and doing extreme 500 calories diet. Now she eats healthy and tries to be healthy. My all family is destroying all my efforts.



I was angry and left. I spend the holiday alone. My sis called me and told me to come over, but I was way too angry. 



My mother called me and told me that since I am fat, I became a bad person *wtf* because I left the family dinner and was hostil when they laught at me.

16331,Non-Romantic,1u9x8q,"I’m not quite sure where to begin.  For some time (around a year), my sister (Izzy) wanted to explore working overseas in a larger corporate environment than the relatively small pond that New Zealand can offer.  About six months ago, she took a job in Sydney, Australia.

Izzy was in an eight year long relationship with Ben (M31) at that point.  I met Ben through my sister, and since Ben and I have so much in common he essentially became my older brother.  He was one of my groomsmen at my wedding, two years ago.  When Izzy left for Australia, she was taking a year-long contract and agreed to try long-distance with Ben for that.  This was the product of much negotiation, since Ben was not interested in long-distance and wanted her to stay, yet moving with her would have jeopardised his career significantly.

The day after Izzy moved, she dumped Ben over the phone.  They owned a home (and a mortgage) together, along with six years of accumulated stuff that a home collects.  In New Zealand, this kind of relationship means that they have the same relationship property rights as married couples, and the breakup necessitated a legal separation agreement.

Ben had to arrange itemising, separating out, and delivering all of Izzy’s stuff to my parents’ place (which they weren’t happy to hold on to either) since Izzy was overseas.  This was a very, very arduous task.  He did so graciously, even though the separation agreement was clearly in Izzy’s favour and he was paying out the ass to keep the few things he had.  To keep the house he had to find another mortgage as well, which was difficult.

All through this time Izzy is telling Ben that she might have made a mistake, and when she visited in mid September she acted physically as though they were still together by trying to kiss him and holding hands, which Ben did not let her do because it was fucking with his head and heart.  Since she left, Izzy has had minimal contact with me (despite my best efforts) and left texts and FB messages ignored, and did not answer her phone when I called nor returned my messages.  On my birthday in October she called me and bitched most of the call about Ben dating someone very casually, after which I became fed-up with the conversation and ended the call (politely).

To boot, Izzy has invited herself to Ben’s brother’s wedding, which was strange given that Izzy has only met him (Oscar) a handful of times at Ben’s family events, and has only met Oscar’s fiancé once or twice at those events.  Ben, Oscar and his fiancé do not want Izzy to attend the wedding, however, but because Izzy is delaying the whole legal aspect of the breakup from proceeding by taking a very long time to sign documents, Ben is afraid that she will use the wedding as leverage to renegotiate the separation agreement even further in her favour.  Ben wants to wait until she has signed all the legal stuff before telling her that she is not invited and never was.

Recently, a few details have come to light - she had been having an emotional affair with an old friend (M31) in Sydney for at least a year prior to her leaving New Zealand, and when she moved to Australia she was staying at his place until she found her own apartment.  She has been in a relationship with him since she was over there, and spent Christmas and New Years with him and his friends in another part of New Zealand (apparently it was a “last-minute” trip).  Since she was back in the country has not relented from trying to contact me via phone and text “just to chat”, though she had made it clear she was too busy to do so over the past six months.  She is now trying to contact my wife to get me to talk to her.  I am reluctant to because she's either lying to me about herself, trying to weasel information about Ben out of me, or complaining about a scenario she is responsible for in the first place!

I feel as though I can’t ignore the utter disrespect she has shown to Ben, my parents, and myself.  I'm mad that she 

* left an eight-year relationship by emotionally cheating on Ben; 
* skipped the country before dumping him so that he would have to suffer the fallout and arrange the separation, all whilst stringing him along
* ignoring my attempts to contact her; and 
* using my parents as little more than a storage depot 

all so that she can start a new life overseas with her loved ones picking up the pieces after she left.

I really want to cut ties with her but since she knows that I am quite close with Ben I’m worried that she is going to use that against him in the separation - he’s already getting screwed enough (not just financially, but emotionally).  I am incredibly angry at her, but the anger is not why I want to cut ties; it’s the fact that I just don’t respect her as a person anymore.

What do you think I should do next?  I want to handle this situation with tact, however given how pissed I am I’m not sure I’m seeing logic.  All I see is that she is using everyone that loves her until she has no use for them anymore, then shits on them until she needs them again.

16337,Non-Romantic,24auq1,"Hi everyone.

I hope this is the appropriate subreddit for this. Hopefully I haven't rambled too much. I've tried to be as concise as possible, but it's difficult when there is just so, so much to this. Here we go:  

Context  
I (20/M) live at home with my mother (58/F) and sister (18/F). My dad has been out of the picture since we were young, so it's just the three of us. 
My mother is, in my opinion, one of the most selfless, caring people you could ever meet. My sister on the hand, is disrespectful, deceitful and manipulative.
This is causing severe stress for my mother, to the extent that it is aggravating a preexisting medical condition (It flared up and now she can't drive). 

My Mother has zero control over what my sister does. She'll do **anything** to get what she wants. She's enrolled in a tertiary course but we don't even know if she attends classes anymore. Has had jobs in the past, but never keeps them. There's so much I could say, but I'll give you just a couple of examples of her typical behavior.

Here's an example of the kind of thing my sister typically does:  
- it's Mum's birthday, I'm to be driving us on a two hour trip to a family friend's house  
- Sister refuses to be in the car with us, says she will only go if she can drive Mum's car alone, while we go in mine. Demands to be given petrol money for this.  
- Mum, wanting the whole family there on her birthday without argument, actually agrees to this.  
- Sister gets the money, says she'll follow behind us, never does, stays home, refuses to give back the petrol money mum gave her.  
- Oh yeah, she didn't buy Mum a present. (repeat for Xmas, easter, my birthday, etc)
 
Another example:  
-Mum bans my sister from driving Mum's car, because she ran a red light, scratched the bumper and was smoking inside of it. (i.e no respect for my mum's car what-so-ever, actually refuses to pay the fine as well)  
- Sister still refuses to give back the key, hides it.  
- Mum puts a club lock on the steering wheel  
- While home alone, sister steals the spare key in mum's room (so that she has both keys), breaks the club lock off, drives off, doesn't come home for two days, just parks the car in random side streets so we can't find it. 

This is quite literally destroying our family. Mum's tried everything she can think of, from sitting down and talking, to kicking her out for a few weeks (to my Dad's place, with whom she's had some contact over the years but long story short, he didn't want her there and she came back with us. She's had her pocket money cut off (she just steals instead), Mum even called the police when the car was taken but they couldn't/didn't do anything as mum didn't want her charged. She is completely unapproachable/unable to be reasoned with, refuses family counselling. Mum feels like we can't kick her out again, because she'll end up on the streets doing drugs, etc.

In terms of my relationship with her, she pretends I don't exist. So I feel like I'm tip-toeing around in my house. 

Does anyone have experience in dealing with a teenage girl like this? Is it a phase? Will she come to her senses?

Let me start by saying my best friend, tara (25f) has been my friend for ten years. Other friends have come and gone but she's always been there for me. Her boyfriend chad(29m) is a nice enough guy, they have been together for seven years and have a child together.

I was browsing Reddit tonight when a notification popped up on my phone from vine saying my friend Chase had added a vine, or something along those lines. Right away I was confused, I don't know a Chase, so I went to check it out and am greeted by a dick profile picture. Every vine was of him masturbating into panties and bras, I'll admit I checked out some of the vines. I started to notice that the background looked familiar.

The videos were taken from what looked like Tara and Chad's apartment. So I did some investing on their instagram to see if I could match up some of the things I was seeing. It's definitely their apartment and that's definitely Chad in the videos. Now at first I thought maybe it's something they're both involved in and who am I to judge, until I saw that he captioned in one of the videos that he snuck into the neighbors house and was masturbating into the neighbors bra. 

They live next door to tara's family, she has a thirteen year old sister that lives there. The dresser he pulled the bra from is definitely belongs to tara's sister. I just don't what to think. Do I tell her? Is this my business? How do I even go about this? Help please!

She stopped with the sexts, but still continued occasionally texting him under the guise of being his friend now (Hey, wanna hang out tonight with some people?) but it's pretty obvious she's not content being his friend. She still sent him the odd drunk one saying she misses him. They broke up almost 2.5 years ago and we've been dating 1.5 years. 

Recently she blocked me on FB and Instagram. We were never friends or following each other on either site, but I could tell she blocked me because everything she ever said on my SO's FB page just disappeared one day. Then I checked Instagram out of curiosity and noticed she had blocked me. To be honest, I've never creeped on her more than like once and realized her profiles on both sites were private. I could never see anything she posted or anything about her. And now I still can't, but she went to the effort of blocking me. I guess I'm wondering what the purpose of that would be. Does blocking someone give you added security from them or something? What is the benefit? Can she no longer see things I post on my SO's page or something? I just don't understand.

We both share cultural backgrounds (Asian) but our lives couldn't be any further from one another. Growing up, my family was very relaxed and loving, despite growing up with very little money. My parents never pushed any serious hobbies onto me or my siblings, just encouraged our passions and helped us to try our best academically. 

My boss is the complete opposite on the spectrum. She boasts about her children and all the instruments they could play by X age and how they can speak so many languages and didn't have time to play 'silly video games'. There is a clear difference between addressing their achievements and belittling my own lack of achievements, it's painfully obvious every time it happens.

Both her children are of a similar age to me and studying medicine in prestigious colleges, something they should definitely be proud of. But her comments sometimes make me feel as if she looks down on my own studies and achievements. 
I'm currently majoring in Architecture, a subject I'm incredibly passionate about and enjoy thoroughly yet I find myself doubting the credibility and importance of my course when my boss makes off hand comments. 

The lady has an incredibly figure, which puts my slightly overweight self to shame. It's even got to the point where she'll visibly look me up and down, then make comments about how she feels self conscious and 'fat' in the clothes she has on that day. She's considerably smaller than myself, which makes me feel ridiculous. 

She can be a really nice lady the majority of the time, she's considerate with all her staff and she's a good boss. I just feel a little deflated when I have to deal with her comments.

Regardless, it's causing a bunch of us a considerable amount of stress, especially as everyone starts to get to the age where everyone gets engaged.


I'm a female. A close friend of mine, male, went through an awful breakup with a very longterm girlfriend about a year and a half ago. She left him suddenly, and as is usually the case, it turned out she had been seeing someone else. This was devestating to our whole group because it was extremely hard to watch him go through this, but we all lost a close friend too. 


Said guy friend spent the next year getting back on his feet, but as a handsome dude, eventually did a fair amount of dating and adjusted better than expected. About 6 months ago, he met the girl causing our/my grief. 


Until this point, everyone else in this group gets along wonderfully. There is never any amount of drama or gossip and it's a really solid and loving crowd. Dude friend eventually even made up with his cheating ex and brought us all to a party at her place. So until this point, It's all gravy. Everyone has always been VERY cool, respectful, and generally compatible as people. 


From the start, I could sense the tension in our group with his new girl around. She's incredibly rude, controlling, and manipulative. She has to have CONSTANT attention to the point where she domineers every event she comes to, which is now, everything. She panders to all of his interests, even though she initially stated that some of them were weird. She is also INCREDIBLY inappropriate with his other male friends, always trying to lay on top of them and saying weird sexual things all the time. I think her end game is to make her bf realize how sexy and desirable she is. She's about three years older than the rest of us and definitely has her eye on a ring. I am definitely stuck between supporting my friend unconditionally and telling him that she seems like poison. It's worth it to note that my friend hasn't indicated that he notices any of this. We think he's relieved to be connecting with someone again and very caught up in it. I have tried for months to be happy for him. 


She just moved into his apartment, which is MY BOYFRIEND'S apartment while we house hunt. She pulled this shit where she moved her stuff in little by little over a span of a few weeks and then let it slip at a party in front of us that she had subletted her apt out. Her boyfriend was surprised by this news too as it came, but was more overcome with happiness that his regular sex partner would be there, than to realize not everyone was benefitting/accepting of this move. 


She does a lot of weird things to keep the attention on her, like at a dinner party, pretending she's never heard of dish soap (and I don't mean a specific brand, I just mean that it exists in general) as a segue into talking about how she's always had cleaning people and how rich she is. This is in spite of the fact that she went to an ivy league school and clearly isn't dumb. And she talks like Paulie Shore. It's all just a horrible act. She is 34ish and never before been in a relationship, just to shed a little more light on her ability to connect meaninfully with people. 


My last straw was when she was actually complaining about his family to us, who are the sweetest people that I've ever met, who take great care of their kids an all our friends and are the most awesome and nicest.

16380,Non-Romantic,34hm1r,"Throwaway cause I don't know who all around me is on reddit.

So a little background:

My girlfriend who we'll call Sam used to date this guy in middle school who we'll call Kody. We're all currently juniors in high school.
The fact that they were in this relationship doesn't bother me, cause it was middle school and those relationships aren't serious.

The part of this all that bothers me is that before Sam and I got together, she had a relationship with Kody that was primarily sexting on snapchat. This lasted from early on in their freshman year up until we started dating. 

At that point, she didn't cut contact with him but the sexting came to a close. He would still try to pressure her into it and threaten her but she would never do it because she was committed to me at that point.

Whenever we would argue, she would basically say K bye. I'm gonna talk to Kody cause he can cheer me up. So that would basically make me feel like shit. I would end up groveling to get her to talk to me again and everything seemed like it was being spun back around on me. I felt like I was constantly apologizing.

We've since grown from that. That was early in our relationship, and although we hit a rough patch a couple months back we pretty much have figured out the best way to resolve our arguments with each other.

Sam and I have always dealt with jealousy, yet I feel like she took it to more extreme measures. Anybody who I had made advances on before or any girls that had crushes on me had to be blocked and deleted from any social media. However, when I would suggest that she blocked Kody because he was constantly trying to pressure her into being unfaithful, she would be upset and tell me there would be no reason to because she wasn't going to give in (which I have never once doubted) and that I didn't trust her enough. It was never a matter of me not trusting her, but rather having no trust in him. She would stop talking to him, claiming he was an asshole and only saw her as an object, but then would inevitably bring it back up. She would tell me that he changed, she wanted me to give him a chance and be his friend which I would've had no problem with had he not treated Sam how he did.

It all came to a head when I was playing in a baseball game and she texted my best friend Shane who was there watching. She somehow nonchalantly brought up that she was bored and she'd snapchatted Kody to come and pick her up so they could hang out. I know she wouldn't have cheated, but it makes my blood boil just thinking about it. Shane got pissed at her for me. He hates Kody as much as I do, but it's more of a defensive big brother type instinct for him and Sam. When I texted her later, she apologized profusely and told me that once he told her that his parents weren't home she stopped talking to him. She said she just wanted to see his sister and his parents who she had known for a while. This was still the last straw for me so I told her to block him and unfollow him on any social media, which she obliged.

That had been the status quo for a while until just this week. It was his birthday, so she told me she was going to text him and say happy birthday. She waited most of the day but got no response so she told me she was going to unblock him on snapchat since she didn't know if she had the right number. She did get a reply saying thank you. That was it. She offered to block him again after as she just didn't want to feel bad. He'd texted her and wished her a happy birthday last month, so she only felt like it was right which I agreed. I told her I didn't mind if she left him and she agreed to tell me when she snapchatted him, if ever. I just couldn't help the impulse thought of logging on and seeing if anything was sent.

She still doesn't forgive him for how he treated her before, and she talks bad about him to me. She'll talk about his ugly hair that he's been growing out, or the fact that he wore converse to his prom, or even about his smaller-than-average manhood. I just can't shake the feeling that he's better than me, and I feel like it stems from back when she would talk to him when she was upset at me. I feel like he's more attractive, more in shape, a better athlete, all of these things. I don't like feeling like he's going to steal her from me even when I know I'm being irrational.

Once, I overheard her reply f--- you, b---- to one of her gangster-looking friends (in an ironically *positive* tone), casually as if any normal college girl would've said, Heh, that's awesome. She also seems rather unforgiving: When she wasn't around, she left her Facebook logged in on her laptop; I checked her block-list. Hers seemed like a mile long!

She delayed getting a drivers' license for so long and (when I last heard) STILL hasn't gotten a car. (Turning 23 this May, she has a scooter now, but can't use highways; it tops out at 35.) That's why I had to chauffeur her around more often than I wanted. I only want to chauffeur if I'm paid like one.

Her shoplifting over Christmas break made our family force me to take her back early, just two days after Christmas. I didn't want to risk taking her drama home to my parents' again, which is why that following summer, I left without her for two weeks. I left town while she wasn't home; those two weeks felt good; it was a relaxing time to be away from her explosive drama.

Then I came back. Not only did she replace a couch I could comfortably sleep on with an *armchair* I could NOT sleep on (despite explicit instructions to only replace the old couch with another one *I could sleep on*; she couldn't differentiate an armchair from a *couch*,) **she moved her boyfriend in while I was gone!**

They were conveniently not home when I came back, but her boyfriend's things were all there now, and that made me **FURIOUS**. So furious, that I **NEARLY pled for help on Facebook!** (That would've amounted to airing dirty laundry too though. I had between 950 - 1000 friends on there too; can you imagine the fallout from so many seeing that?)

I hadn't even made a frantic call to my parents either! *Thus I had showed an INCREDIBLE sense of restraint over this!* I *still* haven't reported her deed to my parents; in the future, I could use the prospect of my parents hearing that, as a bargaining tool to leverage something in my favor if needed!

Even though I was being paid an extra $100/month of her boyfriend's rent, that wasn't easily justifying the extra baggage I was forced to handle. Her boyfriend smoked and had a DUI ^(though he claimed he was sitting in his parked car when busted. That could be a cover reason though.) They'd also fight very verbal and loud arguments at 5 in the morning; I didn't appreciate that disturbance in an apartment not soundproofed. I couldn't fathom the embarrassment of neighbors woken to overhear their verbal altercations.

My sister finally moved out at the start of August 2012, so that was good riddance to her drama, and that un-asked-for roommate moved out that following spring. (Took him long enough!)

I still resent her choices and the way she treated me **even though I gave her a place to stay for free.** I have reasons to believe she hasn't returned to her goody twoshoes self that I appreciated about her in high school. In a bigger college town where she and my youngest sister lives now, does she still hang with the wrong crowd? I'm not there to see it, but she has two jobs now and there's no telling what else she's up to. But she did have another relationship, which seemed about as short as the one she made me put up with.

When Mom had told me myths and tall tales growing up, *there's one I'm starting to think is true*: **Mom told about a stillborn daughter she supposedly switched out with a healthy daughter of a Hispanic mother at an Army Post hospital when no one was looking.**

I want tests to *prove whether my middle sister is in the same gene pool* with our family. (How much would that cost? I'll just have to send a strand of her hair to a gene-testing facility, right?) Her tendencies and behavior lately indicates that she isn't. I tend to resonate with my youngest sister better, so I know SOMETHING is off about our middle one.

Now, if there's anything you can suggest about how to change our middle sister back to the more easygoing, morally-upstanding angel she was in high school, I'm listening. I need for her to stop giving people around her so much stress and drama, so I look forward to your suggestions. Thanks.

When I got pregnant at 21 with my now husband, my mom told me to consider an abortion AFTER we told her that we were keeping the child and were looking forward to starting a family.  She eventually apologized for both of these things.

Lately, she's been saying shit about the fact that I'm a stay-at-home mom.  She's been saying backhanded things like I couldn't imagine not working at your age, you must get so bored and other stuff.  She even gave me shit about running, saying It must be hard staying pretty for 'Scott.'

Anyways, there was a little problem with finding a babysitter for my son, so I told my mom I might not be able to make it (it's a child-free event).  The babysitter ends up managing to make it and we go.

My mom gave me a little sass about it, but I just shrugged it off.  Eventually she serves wine, and I refuse, since me and Scott are trying for another baby.

She goes off the handle, telling me sarcastically how proud she is of me for being a stupid spoiled housewife and how I did a good job marrying a man who takes care of everything for me.  she then went on to say it's a good thing you're staying skinny, or else your husband would stop fucking you and you'd be shit out of luck.  My husband, who had been defending me, gets really mad at this point, and just gets me to leave.  I was so frustrated I cried until we got home.

 We have a 18 month old daughter and though he's not been aggressive towards people...I don't care, I don't trust him and don't let him near her or our smaller dog at all.

I'm the youngest of three siblings, both boys, and when we were younger we were all practically inseparable. Then something happened and when my oldest brother started high school, my other brother [35m] began to change. It seemed as though he felt slighted that our older brother no longer wanted to be around us and I guess we all just ended up going our separate ways, so to speak. My siblings and I stopped being close by the time I was 10 to the point where we pretty much know more about strangers than each other. 


My second brother with whom I have the problem and I used to fight like crazy when we were younger. I'd always thought that's how siblings were but our fights just progressively got worse as we got older. It was usually about something stupid and although I was the youngest, I usually wasn't the instigator as I didn't want to get on his bad side. My mother's usual response was to say I don't want to hear about it and that was that, no matter what the argument was about. By the time I was 16 it had gotten so bad that I outright believed I hated my brother. I thought he was the fucking devil and had no problem saying it to him. I ended up being forced to confess to my school priest who actually laughed about it, told me that so long as I didn't mean it that I should chalk it up to being frustrated and upset and learn from it. It didn't really end there though. 


Around that time he was out of high school and when I would get home from school, he would come home screaming and raging at me, completely out of the blue. I rarely knew the reason why and the only thing I could come up with was that I just fucking existed and it pissed him off. If he saw me at the computer it would set him off. If I was watching the television, it would make him go nuts. One night he came home and saw that we were out of mini-frozen pizzas and he literally started slamming the freezer door like a kid crying over a spilled ice cream cone. This went on for... I'm not sure how long. One day he came in the front door, started screaming at me, came upstairs, started half-choking me while pushing me slightly over the railing. I can't recall what I apparently did or said but I'm sure it was about me being on the computer when he wanted it. I kicked him off and nothing else happened that day. I question whether that was partly because she remembered the time he full on kicked her when she pissed him off.


Another day later on, he followed me into my room while in one of his pissy moods and pushed me against my door and held my neck against the wall like he wanted to see how far my neck could stretch from the rest of my body. 
Some time later is when things really got bad though. He'd knocked me down to the ground and kneeled over my body while he began choking me to the point where I couldn't breathe. I was a strong girl for 16 but he was older, bigger, and stronger. It took the dog lunging at his neck threatening to bite him just to force him to let me go. I think that was the last time he'd ever laid a hand on me. My dog was more or less my protector and best friend, I doubt he would have stopped had she not intervened.


I ended up with severe migraines every day for that entire year and subsequently developed an ulcer. I hated going home and hated being in the same room as him, let alone living there. I'd contemplated leaving any time I was to go on a trip out of the area. I did attempt to tell my mother but she would just say I don't want to hear it and if I persisted she would just say it even louder. She didn't give a fucking shit. I never told my father because he would sleep in the day and work at night... and I figured if I told her what he was doing she might have actually done something about it. She never did. 


The physical stuff stopped but the obvious hate and aggression towards me kept going for a while. At this point he had gotten his own computer and I guess that cooled things off a bit. Sometime later on, he went to use the main computer after I had gone to bed and seemed to be having a problem with it. He would routinely go on there and clear out stuff on the drive without even telling me so I could save my work, so I made my own separate account just in case. Apparently that pissed him off so much that he spent an entire night after everyone had gone to bed, whispering against my door that he was going to fucking kill you (me) in your sleep. It wasn't just once or twice, it was continuous for a good few hours into late in the night/morning. I ended up pushing a dresser in front of my door just to be able to sleep that night. I don't even know if he knew I was awake. For the next year or so, I slept with the door blocked from the inside. Eventually, all of that stuff stopped and life moved on.


About five years ago, somehow it all came back up. I vaguely recall my mom talking about how we need to start getting along, to talk to teach other, we're all each other has and all that fucking bullshit. I'm pretty sure that all set me off to the point where I asked her if family is so fucking important then why did my brother seem to want me dead and why didn't she give a damn? I told her everything that happened and I practically saw red when she responded by asking why didn't you tell me?. She then said it was time to get over it and move on. At that point I'd had enough of the bullshit, went to my room only to have my brother start saying how we both were wrong, we both did bad things and for the most part, it all seemed like he didn't remember a damn thing that happened. He never once apologized for hurting me or threatening to do worse to me, and so I never really accepted his 'olive branch'. 


Fast forward a few years, over time I got over it. I've forgiven him, in a way, but I haven't forgotten. I have siblings but I really have no fucking clue what it's like to actually have siblings. Since all of that happened, I was unable to be around him. If I was hungry and he was in the kitchen, I went to bed hungry. If he was in one room, I went to another. I couldn't even eat at the same table as him because I felt like he was probably just silently judging/criticizing me. It's not as bad anymore but I'm still horribly self conscious around him to the point where I really don't even talk when he's around. 
He now is in a relationship with a lady I really like, and she has a 10 year old son. Seeing him with this kid has brought up some feelings of resentment and pain all over again. I've seen him with her child and there's a part of me that's somewhat jealous of how he is with this kid. He bonds with him. He looks out for him, he's actually not half bad with him. I have NEVER seen anything like that, firsthand from him. I have one good memory of him driving me to get an ice cream one day but that's about it. I know he's older now so that's part of it, but I can't help wondering why the hell I got the brother with roid-rage (that's how he acted, anyway) and everyone else now sees the 'nicer' side of him. 


These feelings also have me upset with my mother. She's been a great mother but she's also very dismissive and doesn't like to be told she's wrong or that she made a mistake. But frankly, I fucking resent her for this. I know I was almost an adult when all of this started but I always thought that if your kid comes to you honestly believing someone is going to fucking kill them - because they said they will, repeatedly - that you should probably fucking care. She never did. I have no idea how it's affected me. For the most part I'm not angry anymore, but there's still a huge part of me that feels betrayed, let down, dismissed, and a slew of other things I can't quite put into words. Obviously this isn't something I can speak to my brother about because it won't do any good. I can't talk to my mother either because she'll take it more as an offense to her as opposed to me wanting answers and a reason for why she just didn't seem to care about any of this. I should mention she's actually a really great mom. She's not without her flaws like the rest of us and she isn't someone I'd turn to if I was having trouble with things, but she still gave up a lot for us. I don't want to undermine the good person she is by all of this.


Where do I go from here? Just move on and continue to ignore it? Is it unreasonable for me to still have residual feelings from this after so much time? I'm totally interested in the brutal honest truth and opinions that any of you have.

TL;DR: Brother went through a time when he was excessively abusive to me to the point where he both threatened to harm/kill me, and may have tried to actually do it once.

This semester I changed my major so I'm taking classes with new people and meeting new friends. I met a guy this semester. He's funny and smart. Recently I got a new credit card (my first one) and he knows all about it. So, I did some online shopping and that was it, don't wanna over extend with it since it's the first time I have one. 


Today he called and asked for a favor. He wants me to buy him plane tickets to travel to another city this upcoming weekend so he asked for all the information of my credit card and such. Reddit, I'm not comfortable with this. I have only known this guy for 3 months and his work consists on a marketing network (the ones you have to get x amount of people involved in the business in order to get paid) and he only has been part of it for a month or so. He invested like 1K and I don't even know if that will pay off. 
I told him it'd be okay because I felt pressured and we hung up. But then I texted him and said I didn't feel comfortable giving him my credit card info so I needed the website where he was buying the tickets. He said he wasn't gonna rob me or anything and I said my mom always taught me to be cautious. Then he said I was the best because that way he didn't have to ask his brother 
for the favor. That kinda upset me. He's very close with this family. Why would he prefer to ask me than to ask a family member? He even shares rooms with his brother. Anyway, then he said I owe you a few favors already, one more doesn't even count so I was like mhm ... But after that he told me (except from the call, all of this was via text) it was better if we did it tomorrow when we see each other at school and we ended the conversation right there. 

I'm such a giver. I can't say no when people ask for these kind of things but I don't know, this just feel wrong. Do you guys have any advice on how can I decline? I don't wanna jeopardize our friendship over this because I see him in almost every class of mine and he's very good friends with my new friends so that would be awkward. Or should I just go with it?

16455,Non-Romantic,2o3npd,"Long story short. Mom is a bit much to deal with. I've recently begun to suspect that she may be a little more than slightly narcissistic. My dad left home when I was 18 because he just couldn't deal with her anymore. I left home at 19, dropping out of college and hitting the road, because I couldn't deal with her anymore either. Was homeless for a couple of years until I picked myself up by my boot staps and got an apartment and a job.

Lived various places. When I was 26 mom begged Please come home, I'll help you with school, car, just finish your education and I won't bother you with anything. The economy where I lived had gone bad and it was a struggle to support myself with the work available so I took her offer. I was a star student. My GPA starting off was like a 2.0, but working hard and taking extra classes I brought it up to a 3.5. My GPA for pre-nursing was a 4.0.

Well nursing school didn't work out as planned. I just couldn't handle it, especially that third semester, and especially since I was working 30-40 hours every weekend. So I dropped/flunked (I was dropping but they found some last minute excuses to stick me with an F) and instead I took an EMT class in the spring and plan to become a paramedic. I also plan to move out soon, however, I have some unidentified problem with me knee (effusion with no known cause, can hardly walk up stairs) and I'm waiting on the results of my NREMT.

Okay so, during the years I was in school mom would always badger me about applying for food stamps. Well I didn't qualify because I was a student of higher learning. In order to qualify I needed a job and work 10+ hours a week. Well I did work, odd jobs, weekend jobs, mostly under the table, so I never qualified yet just about every month she would badger me to check again because maybe the rules changed or maybe you'll get a different person.

For the record, all of the money I made when I worked these weekends pretty much went into the house, and I was spending all of my time on school work. I had no personal spending money. And it's not like mom went far out of her way to help me; she's on section 8 and SSID so adding me on, with me being a full time student, basically cost her nothing. She gets SNAP + all these vouchers for pantries and food banks so her food was almost all free, she helped me with gas and some insurance payments and that was it really.

Anyway, last summer I got a job before entering my third and last semester of nursing. As soon as I started working here comes mom needing money. I understood I needed to help but it just seemed she always needed more and more and more and more. And if I ever refused or didn't have it it was a huge fucking argument. Pardon my language. Eventually my knee problem started and I had to quit that job, because I couldn't even walk and it was a very physical labor job.

At her behest I applied for SNAP again last month. I had to quite work because of my knee, was not a student (so her housing allowance changed), so I understood when she said she needed a burden lifted, and that, quote if you can just buy your own food, that's however hundred or so dollars each month I don't have to worry about. So to me that's the important part - get SNAP to buy your own food. And I agreed, so I applied. I qualified and got it, 190/month + an extra 40 because they apply them retroactively so I got a bit extra for a partial month. I had planned to buy her some treats with the extra 40 and some things for the house, but I didn't even get a chance because she would nag me 5x a day did they call? did you get them? so when she asked I said yes and she immediately handed me a shopping list. Okay no problem... But her shopping list was $80 (she named things by brand, like Primerose bacon, $12/pound, etcetc), and my personal shopping was only $30 (I'm trying to lose weight for health reasons, my diet consists of basically 1/2 cup of rice each day, 1-2eggs, 1/2 of almonds or walnuts, 6oz of chicken or beef, some fruit), so right away there 1/3 my stamps for the month and I had only 1 week of food for it, meanwhile she has her fancy bacon, her fancy butter, her fancy cream cheese, her fancy yogurt...

A couple of days later I had forgotten milk for myself, so when I went to go out it was her usual interrogation, where are you going, etc, I told her I need milk and her reply was Now wait, let's not spend it all right away, let's be frugal with it and see what we have at the end of the month. - Wait, what? Let's? What we have? I come back and a few hours later she bursts into my room (she doesn't understand the concept of closed doors) talking about our shopping list for the month... I asked her, honestly, do you plan to feed us both on my SNAP? And she got all indignant No, but I need help! Yes but that wasn't the original thing we discussed and you're sucking up all my SNAP. Of course I'm selfish though, eating only 1400 calories a day...

To top it off she gets super pissy when I eat her food, and she'll say something like Oh, you'll eat MY food but want to be greedy with your SNAP card, I see! - but I only eat her food because I don't have any food because it was MY SNAP CARD THAT BOUGHT THAT SHIT. For example we had another argument and I ended up spending my last $30 of SNAP for the month on her stuff, had no food for myself, so ate some meat from her freezer and now she's pissed about it. And there's no reasoning with her. Because SHE NEEDS HELP - and that's basically how she is. She'll help you, usually involuntarily, but the cost of that help, IE what she demands in return, pretty much undoes the help she gave you in the first place, so she'll give you 1 and then demand 2 or 3.

Anyway, it's moot because as soon as my knee is fixed and I'm working as an EMT, I'm *gone*, but I just wanted to check and make sure *I'm* not being unreasonable, because her and I do have a fairly toxic relationship and sometimes trying to maintain my boundaries can result in a bit of overcompensation.

Thanks guys.

16456,Non-Romantic,2qogxx,"For the past roughly 6 months, I've been living in this house with 3 other guys. The other two seem all right enough from what I see of them, but I'm having serious issues with one, a guy I'll call Tony.

Tony has been extremely passive aggressive the whole time I've been here. At first, he seemed like an okay guy, but then he went downhill.

He has:

* dumped items and trash in front of my door twice. The first time was over some extremely insignificant rule in the lease. The second time, the trash wasn't even mine.    
* stolen items from me. I confronted him about it once, and he completely denied it, saying it was his. He's since stolen more items from me, including food. The first time he did it, he replaced it with a shittier version and the second time, he gave me a spare, probably to shut me up. On subsequent times, he's done nothing, avoiding me totally.  
* thrown some of my food in front of my door to make room for some of HIS food in the freezer. After I threw some of his food in front of his door because I was so pissed off about what he did, he bought his own fridge and bought me a new Tupperware to make up for one he broke by throwing at my door.   
* I've tried talking to him about this. He gets nasty and claims it's his or ignores me totally. So there is zero talking to him at this point.

I've been considering more drastic measures. I'd love to move out, but I'm stuck in a lease. I hate being here because I'm so stressed out thinking about what could happen to more of my stuff by Tony. I'm considering telling my landlady about this situation when she comes to collect rent and telling her that either I get all my shit back and pay rent, or she can let Tony be a jackass while I withhold rent or she breaks my lease and lets me move out. For what it's worth, he's done some destruction around the place, so he isn't exactly in her best books.

I've also considered calling the police or breaking and entering to get my shit back as an absolute last resort.

Any ideas?

16459,Non-Romantic,1soh57,"Title is pretty self explanatory. I absolutely adore my housemate, but her league games are making me go insane. From the moment she gets home at 6 to when she goes to bed around 2-4am she's playing league. Sometimes we go to the gym together or play video games in the living room, but the rest of the time she's playing league. 


Now, I have no problems with the game itself. It's the volume, man. She's yelling and screaming into her headset the entire time. At minimum she's talking at a decent volume. Her bedroom is off of our kitchen and our rooms share a wall. Our apartment isn't huge so it's not like I can early distance myself. Even worse, she doesn't close her bedroom door all the way because she wants her cat to be able to go in and out of her room. If I want to watch TV I have to crank the volume. I can't read without being distracted by her constant yelling and talking. It's as if she's on a phone call all night or something. 


I wouldn't mind if it was like this now and then, but it's all the time. I have asked her to keep it down many times and it hasn't really gotten better. She no longer wakes me up at night, but I feel like I can't enjoy peace and quiet in my own home if she's around. I can't help but feel that she'd be annoyed if I was doing this and she was trying to relax. 


What should I do/how can I bring it up without coming off the wrong way? I've asked her to be quieter a bunch of times and it's not helping. I feel like an asshole every time I ask because I know she loves the game so much.

Fast forward to last week, We still follow each other on instagram and recently she’s liked a few of my pictures and she even posted a photo of what looked like an old text between us(I’m not 100% sure it’s our text cuz there’s no name and it’s been a long time since we talked).

There are three (previously two) vehicles left behind that we rely on to get to our jobs. To help my sister while we still had two vehicles, I lent her the car I was using and she let various aspects fall into disrepair - so last week my parents, needing a car when they return, purchased a vehicle that she now uses and is extremely possessive of. I thought everything had been fixed...


Yesterday, I get to my car to find the battery dead first thing in the morning. This was alarming to say the least but nothing unusual for a Canadian winter. I text the others and let them know I might need help and text my sister to check the car and swap.


An hour after I get to work, my sister shows up and proclaims nothing is wrong and the car starts fine. (Considering I just drove to work, of course the vehicle will start even with a ruined battery thanks to residual charge.) So she leaves without exchanging cars.


Fast-forward to the end of my shift. It's 9PM and -10^C. My car won't start and the battery is dead. The third person I flag down is willing to help boost and we get things going. Ultimately I end up leaving work 40 minutes later because of this and the amount of indignation I feel is growing.


Upon arriving home, my sister says I guess you didn't need help and here, right here is where I freak out. I blame her for leaving my car in such a state to begin with and for knowingly leaving me with a car that won't start. Her boyfriend [23M] calls me irresponsible trash for trying to pin this on my sister, I respond by demanding respect and ordering him out of the house. Her lack of car knowledge notwithstanding, she left me in the cold with no help. Maybe I shouldn't have freaked out, but her boyfriend's profane attitude in my own home was too imposing to ignore. Everyone (sister,brother,boyfriend,me) start yelling at each other, after 20mins of that they all leave the house. No one is talking except my brother and I.

I rage at my sister, her and her boyfriend rage at me. Now no one is talking to each other and trying to avoid each other.  Was I in the wrong in this?


My sister and her boyfriend are avoiding me and the house. It doesn't feel right, us being at odds, but I can't ignore/forget her boyfriend's attitude or her complete selfishness. (she doesn't even recycle!) Was I wrong in this situation? Should I not have risen to her boyfriend's attitude? Was she to blame for selfishly keeping the car to herself?

She became such a needy and talkative person to the point of annoyance, but for a few weeks I needed it to distract me from some depression. I dated her for just over a week, then she cut it off for unknown reasons.

16499,Non-Romantic,3aicmd,"This guy (we'll call him Todd) have been friends since tenth grade (5 years ago). We were part of a pretty small, close knit friend group back then because we were all the really shy, weird kids. He wasn't my best friend in the world, but we were reasonably close, and I was the first person he came out too.


We went to different universities in our home city, and I began to branch out, make new friends and expand my network. Over the past few years I've really come out of my shell, and I've made a ton of friends with similar interests and hobbies to spend time with. He hasn't really taken down the walls we all built in high school, and is still quite shy, reserved, and awkward like I once was.


At first I tried to invite him along to my school friends events, but he never really talked to anyone and I spent a lot of time sitting with him and not socializing either, just making sure that he wasn't by himself. When he did talk to people, he tried to make jokes that weren't always in the best taste (i.e., some of my friends were vegetarian/vegan, and he made kind of rude comments or jokes about veganism). My friends from uni didn't really connect with him at all, and after a while I stopped inviting him along to things because I didn't want to babysit.


As I got further into my university degree I became more and more serious about my studies and spent a lot of time studying, volunteering, and working at school. Naturally I didn't have as much time to spend with any of my friends during those times. Todd was cool with it at first, but eventually started to accuse me of blowing him off to hang out with my school friends. I would even send him snapchats of myself in the library or in a lab, and he would just respond with Whatever and stop talking to me for a while.


I tried for a while to take a bit more time out of my week and spent time with my high school friends instead of spending time at school, but when exams rolled around I went back to studying full time and Todd got upset at me, telling me I was just pretending to want to see him. I told him I wasn't, but in all honesty after that point I probably was.


Recently, after coming back from spending 3 months studying abroad in Europe, I decided to have a big get-together for all of my friends, high school and university alike. I set a date about a month in advance and Todd RSVP'd on Facebook. A few days later, it was brought to my attention that around 20 of my friends were racing in a 10K the day after I'd planned and wouldn't be able to make it. Three weeks in advance I changed the date to the night before, and everyone seemed happy. Then a few days before the party, I got a message from Todd begging me to change the party back to its original date. He told me he worked that night but really wanted to come. I told him I was sorry, but it was too late to change the date at this point, and if it were the original date, more than 20 people wouldn't be able to come instead. He got upset again, and accused me of changing the date for my other friends but not for him. I apologized again and told him majority rules. Todd said Well, I never get to have fun anymore. I was a bit miffed at that, because I don't want to be responsible for anyones social life. I said sorry once more and left it at that. On every photo posted from the party, Todd commented with a sad face.


Lastly, recently I've gotten more serious in a romantic relationship, and often times after work I will go to my boyfriends for the night, just like I would go home normally to unwind anyways. Todd texted me at the end of a very long shift one night asking me if I wanted to go out drinking. I told him I was exhausted, and I was just going to relax after work. He asked if I was going home, and he could come over with a bottle of wine. I told him I was going to my boyfriends for the night instead. He got really mad at me that time, told me I was making excuses, and accused me of spending all my free time with my boyfriend just like every other dumb insecure girl. He then started accusing my boyfriend of controlling me by making me come to his place after work instead of going to my own apartment. He then asked me if I needed him to pick me up, to take you to a safe place without him. I got really worked up at that, told him my boyfriend was NOT controlling or abusive, I am NOT making excuses, and if he thinks I'm some dumb insecure girl then he can go and find new friends to bother. Later that night I got a really sad groveling text telling me he was sorry, but I ignored it.


I feel terrible but in all honesty, I don't really have much interest in spending time with Todd anymore. We have very little in common at this point in our lives, and I just find myself getting frustrated when I bring him to social events or when he accuses me of not caring about him. How do I deal with a friend who doesn't want to let go?

Being dumb, I kept trying to make the relationship happen--this was probably my biggest mistake--and eventually got the girl to kiss me. The details aren't particularly important because what matters is what happened after things started getting a little more serious. Over winter break I left the country to visit relatives, which meant I didn't get to see her for more than two weeks. I didn't think it would be an issue at the time, but that opinion changed when I finally arrived back home. She seemed extremely removed and didn't give me any clue as to why. In fact, I still don't know what specifically it was that made her suddenly seem disinterested in me. I gave her 3 or 4 days of time before finally confronting her. I had been told by one of her friends that she just wasn't in to me anymore and I let her know that it was fine if she just wanted to be friends, which she seemed happy about. This was maybe 3 weeks ago. For the first week she seemed back to normal albeit a little bit more reserved than she had been, but nowhere near as much as before I confronted her. 



Then, just 2 weeks ago, she began ignoring me again. We had signed up for a class together at a local university, which she paid 250$ for, and she suddenly stopped going to--I was her only source of transportation to it. She also stopped talking to me altogether unless I initiated any sort of conversation. I kind of gave up trying to fix the situation, figuring that the best thing to do is just give her some time, but today I received some information that is really bothering me. 



Two days ago I was invited to a movie night event at a friends house--a friend who also happens to be friends with Sarah. Just this morning the person who invited me let me know that Sarah had noticed I was invited to the event (11 people total were invited) and stated, if he comes, I'm locking myself upstairs in [the friend who invited me]'s room. 



I'm not sure why it bugs me so much, but it seems extremely rude for her to basically make her friends between the two of us when I haven't (as far as I know) done anything to make her dislike me so much. On top of that, she still hasn't talked straight to me and said why she is ignoring me in the first place. I'm not sure what to do at this point; should I go to the event anyways or should I stay at home? Should I talk to Sarah about it or should I just let it go?

My dad was always obese when I was younger. He's around 6ft tall and probably weighed around 270 or more when I was little. We found out around when I was 15 that my dad has type two diabetes. Then when I was 16 our house caught on fire and we had to move into a house owned by my parents' former church until the smoke and water damage could be repaired. About two months after that happened my dad passed out in our bathroom and hit his head. We called an ambulance and while they were screening him at the ER they discovered he had around 98% heart blockage and needed immediate surgery. He had an angioplasty and ended up dropping all of that weight over the next three or four years.

He stopped using his rowing machine and bike, which was primarily how he exercised. He also started eating poorly again. My dad eats a good dinner, and is a great cook (he has cooked for my family most of my life), but other than that he doesn't eat an appropriate lunch and snacks WAY too much.

She's never been able to fully get her life together. Once she starts to get her shit together, the minute something bad happens (ex. a break up) she'll let everything fall apart and she has to start from square one and try to rebuild her life again.

Most recently, last year she was driving drunk and crashed into a tree. Her ankles were almost completely severed and she had to spend months in a rehabilitation center. When she got out she had to live with her mother who is a on/off drug addict and her brother who has his druggie friends over all the time.

She tried to live with her dad for a bit, but they don't get along very well so he kicked her out. She says it's because he has OCD and she left a dirty dish in the sink, but I suspect there's more to the story.

Over the past year she's lost contact with a lot of friends and become very bitter about it. She's been very difficult to speak to because often the conversation will just turn into her moaning about how much pain she's in and how shitty her living situation is. Only recently has she started to become more positive and actually take steps to get her own living accommodation through disabled benefits (it hasn't happened yet).

She's also currently on bad terms with three of our friends and will not accept her fault in any of the issues. In her mind it's just everyone being shitty to her.

I don't live in the country any more, so my interactions with her are limited, but I do speak to her occasionally online and on the phone and I see her whenever I come home. I'm home for Christmas right now and last night I had a Christmas dinner party for some of my friends. L was there, along with two other friends she has issues with - though she maintains the issue is with them. Everything went really well, but when everyone left she started saying the people were being fake to her because they were being nice. I said you were being nice too, there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone just wanted to have a good time and enjoy themselves. I tried to get her to see the experience as a positive interaction with people she doesn't get along with and a step towards a better relationship, but she wasn't having any of it.

I won't get into the full details, but the argument spiraled out of control and turned into a bigger issue of who she's become as a person. She didn't take in a word of what I said because it was said out of anger and she went into full on defense mode, but we've spoken today and she's said she's prepared to listen to me if what I have to say is for the better of our friendship and her as a person.

What I want to know is, how to do speak to her about my issues with the person she's turned into without being offensive or pushing her away?

EDIT: I should also say that I feel like she uses her shitty situation as an opportunity to get pity and attention from people. I don't think she tells people about her situation in order for them to understand what's going on with her, as she would say. This is also a big issue I want to bring up.

16565,Non-Romantic,2yvhs2,"So to start things off were I noticed things were beginning to go downhill. My mother is divorcing her long-time husband (my step-father) and has already moved on with a new boyfriend. While she seems much happier, she's been a lot harder on me and she now prefers to spend time with him (frequently going off to see him and texting him all day). Even when she and I are having a conversation she'll text him and will sound annoyed about having to talk to me. 

Despite knowing that she would be divorcing soon, she decided to not tell me until last minute. So when she did tell me, the first thing I did was realize I needed to find a full-time job with benefits since I used to get my insurance from my stepfather (his company provided it for free to employees and families). I had two PT jobs previously and luckily enough for me one go them offered me a FT job with benefits. With my mother's encouragement I took it. I now had FT classes, a FT job, and a PT job. 

My boyfriend and I lived with my grandparents for a while and after my mom moved home, we decided we needed to get our own apartment. My mom was extremely against it (rent where we live is high, even for small studios, etc) and we're young and in college (plus high paying jobs are difficult to get as-is). However, despite knowing it would be financially tough, I decided moving out was better than having no relationship with my mother. 

Once my boyfriend and I got our apartment things started to turn around. My mom then decided to volunteer me to babysit my sister (still in grade school) so she could do her own thing for a little while each week. I thought it would be nice to see my sister, so I went with it. 

Other things she's done recently is tell me that I should't be working so much and  that I should be going to should have graduated already. She talks to me in a condescending tone, asks me why I make such bad decisions, called me her loser child, talks down to me for not having a thriving social life due to my busy work and school schedule. When I bring up the fact that for my age I am responsible, don't do drugs/ rarely drink, am currently still enrolled in college, working, supporting myself (my family does not help me financially, although my grandparents have in the past), and not pregnant (unlike many girls I graduated with). Despite this, my mother still sees me as a disappointment. 

Recently I decided to pick up an additional job to help me get out of the PT job I currently have. However, this new job I took pays minimum during training, but has the potential to make me much more money (more movement opportunities). So for the time being, I'm in school and currently working three jobs. Since I now work about 70 hours a week, I had to tell my mom I can't babysit anymore. This seemed to upset her more and she just ranted about (again) how I work too much, should be graduating already, and how I should be living at home under her rules, out having fun and traveling (although she doesn't want to finance any of this). 

This last conversation really upset me. I am responsible for my age. I don't ask her for help and I feel like she's disrespecting me and my decisions. I love her, but despite saying she would (in the past), she hasn't stopped criticizing me. I don't know how to handle this situation because prior to her divorce, she was a good (not always compassionate) mother. She tells me frequently I am being too sensitive about the things she says to me and sometimes I feel like maybe I am, but at the same time I do feel I have some right to be upset.

16567,Non-Romantic,3d170j,"I [22M] am an engineering student on a 16 month internship with 1 year left in my degree. I chose a company close to my parent's home because I wanted to save money. I spoke with them about getting a position further away from home and renting an apartment, but they insisted that I get a position near my family home in order to save money due to large rent costs. When I moved back in, I did not agree to pay anything and they did not ask. My father purchased a car for me to commute to work, but the car is under his name. I was going to pay for it myself as I had more than enough money saved up, but he offered to pay for it. I promised to pay for all maintenance for the vehicle, which I have been doing. Since my first year of high school, I have been working part time in order to save money. I was on government loans, but last year, I was not eligible for the loans. I decided to pay for my rent and tuition out of my own hard earned savings. Previously, my father had paid for either my rent OR my tuition. I used the loan to pay for the other. I have 2 sisters, one of which is in university and my parents pay everything for her; rent and tuition. She has never worked before. My finances are not great as I have a lot of debt but I do have a substantial amount of money invested. I must mention that my nationality and background is Hong Kong Chinese. My family would be considered the lower end of middle class.


A month after I started my internship, my parents began to ask me for money; about 20% of my income (they did not say this exactly but the amount was equivalent to 20% of my monthly income). I told them that was ridiculous as this generation, the millennials, will have a much harder life due to a rapid increase in the housing market, a decrease in jobs because of later retirement, contract employment, difficulty in building a career, and low increase in wages. Because of this I need to save my money and invest wisely in order to save enough money to be able to afford a house and retire at an appropriate age. 


Here are some of their arguments:
They argued that **since I have been home I give them much more work.** I asked them what and my mom named off a bunch of things like cleaning, cooking, washing clothes. She seems to think that it is her responsibility to do this and refuses to let me do any of my own  of the household chores but yet holds it against me. 

**Any money I give you we will give back to you just as much. We aren't greedy for your money, but we don't need it.** I partly agree with this, but I do not think they are being fair between me and my sisters. I paid my own rent and tuition and this should more than pay the monthly payment that I owe. They also do not think that as a family we should be counting all of the money so closely like an accountant. I disagree because I spent $16k last year WITHOUT GOV'T FINANCIAL AID (long story) while my sister had all the payments paid for by my parents.   

**If you don't give money how are we going to expect money from your sisters.**  Just what??

**You should give us money because of love.** Money is not about love.

**If you give us money we will be happy since it means you care about us.**

**We used to give 50% of our income to our parents back in the day.** It is a completely different generation, a different country, and a different culture.

**You are too selfish.**  My parents ask me to run errands, such as getting milk several times a week from the grocery store. I also do the dishes and mow the lawn, as well as driving my sister places, etc.

**You have changed so much. I thought I would be happy that you are back.** People will change when they have been living at home for their entire life and then go out to live with other people their same age for 4 years. I have developed my own thinking and have realized my parents' flaws, such as being emotionally manipulative to their own kids.

As of now they have since lowered their request to some spending money for my mother, who is a full time stay at home mom and has not worked in more than 25 years. I still do not think I should pay as they continue to emotionally manipulate me into paying. Whenever I rebuttal their arguments, they choose not to listen and just walk away instead.

I am grateful to my parents for letting me stay at home during my internship but I only agreed to this because they offered, with no strings attached initially.  My sisters do not work and do not do well in school, yet my parents wholeheartedly support them and have no problem paying for all their expenses and more. I do not want to give in them because I believe that their rationalizations are unfair and I want to keep saving for my future. Am I justified in my decision? Has anyone else experienced anything similar with their own families and can offer me some insight? 

My girlfriend's parents are also Hong Kong Chinese but her parents are very westernized. She asked her parents the same thing and they said that they would never ask her for money because they understand how hard it will be in the future and they want her to save money for a home in the future. Why are my parents not this logical?

It's both our first real relationships but I feel we are both mature, rational people who can communicate our feelings really well so I'm not concerned with our inexperience.

About a few weeks before I was going to meet my girlfriend's parents for the first time, and then she would come back with me to meet mine, my mom has dinner with me. She tells me that she really has seen a positive change in me so she, overall, likes my girlfriend but doesn't want me to leave my gf with my best friend alone at all when my gf is in town.

I asked her why and she said that with alcohol things can happen and that since my gf is naive and inexperienced, she can be talked into things. She also told me that she's seen too many situations where this has happened. She continued to tell me about how our financial adviser (I'll call him John) was cheated on by his wife with his very own intern because John was always out of town and would ask his intern to check on his wife for him. 

This, of course, upset me because she was making a lot of assumptions about the kind of person my girlfriend and best friend were. I've known my best friend for eight years and I've never known him to stab me in the back even in some bad situations.

I also think it's incredibly closed minded of her to think that we have no control over our desires and emotions and that my best friend or girlfriend would put themselves in those situations where something could happen.

On the other hand, I'm not naive enough to think what my mother said has never happened before. I just want to know if I am justified in being upset with my mom for saying these things.

Basically you can say I grew up in a very dysfunctional family, and I've been in CBT for years to work to establish healthy relationships in my life.

I don't even know what to say if she's not responding on a clinical level. She knows how I feel about suicide (I'm definitely against it, as you have nothing to lose before trying other methods to get better before making a stupid permanent decision), especially having lost two people I really love that way. What am I supposed to do, other than tell her I love her? I can't tell if it's a cry for help, or if she's being dramatic.

My brother was head over heels for her-- he says he prayed to God that he experience love just once before he dies (from suicide) and that God led him to her. He was absolutely crazy about her. She broke up with him for a number of reasons, which are all valid. He has taken the breakup VERY POORLY. He maintains a personal blog, and over 90% of the posts are about her/the breakup. 

Laura and I became close during the last ~6-8 months of their relationship. Mike knew this. He didn't like it, because Laura and I would go out drinking, which he disapproved of. When Laura dumped Mike, he sat me down and told me that I was not allowed to be friends with Laura anymore. He said it would hurt him greatly. I said that that was an unreasonable request, since he knows very little about my personal life, and he would not know if I was her friend either way, since he is not on Facebook and I don't talk about my friends to him. 

So, for the first few months, when he asked about her, I was extremely vague about our friendship/her life. I did this to both protect his feelings and to avoid unnecessary drama. However, some info has started to come out, and he now knows we are friends.

I intervened, saying that it is unfair to pressure Becky into a decision, and that it's not Abi's decision to make. 

Becky told Abi that she didn't know what she wants to do next year, however the real story is that nobody wants to live with Abi, including Becky. Becky wants to live with the rest of the flatmates, all male. 

A little background on Abi: She's pretty fucking annoying. General stuff, like flipping her shit over something insignificant, being loud and weird as fuck, overdramatic, bringing her weird quasi-boyfriend over and so-on. We are all fed up already, and don't want it to continue into next year. If Becky doesn't live with the rest of the flat, we will still not live with Abi. From when we moved in, Abi roped Becky into being her BFF, and constantly makes her come over to her room to talk and so on. We don't think Abi has had many friends prior to university, and Becky feels obliged to be nice to Abi despite the fact she doesn't really like her.

We're (all flatmates except Abi and Becky) concerned that Becky will get roped into living with somebody she doesn't want to because she's too nice.

Under no circumstances will the rest of the flatmates live with Abi next year. We'll happily live with Becky.

How do we proceed, and have the conversation where we say that Becky doesn't want to live with Abi, and instead wants to live with the rest of the flatmates without Abi?

(If it sounds like I'm talking for Becky, I sort of am but aren't. She's the type of person that if she gets pressured by somebody, she'll do something. We've had a conversation with her about it, and this is how she feels. She appreciates our support of her, especially when I defended her against Abi's pressure).

Edit: Got a couple comments saying that it's drama. No shit, I know it is. Compared to other stuff in the sub it's petty, however it's a big deal to us. We're looking for some help solving an issue with our flatmate, if you don't have anything constructive to say then please don't comment.

16659,Non-Romantic,2yy3tw,"My cousin, Gracie, is being emotionally and possibly physically abused by her mother, Susie. I come from an asian family. My mom is white and my dad is Chinese. Susie, who is Thai, married my dad's oldest brother. When I first met Susie as a young girl, I didn't like her, because it was really obvious that she was marrying my Uncle for money. Eventually she grew on me as I got older. 

As I got older I learned that when Susie was in high school she was hospitalized for anorexia on multiple occasions. Fast forward to present day, my family (all except my dad) believes that Susie has been cheating on my uncle. 

Susie has an older daughter, Gracie, and a younger son, Chase. With each pregnancy she had an early c-section. Her children were born prematurely, because she didn't want her body to get bigger according to my mother. Both of her kids are very small for their age. Is that even legal for a mother to give birth early just because she doesn't want to get fat? 

When Chase was born, it was obvious that Susie favored the boy. She made Gracie do chores at a very young age like 6 or younger she yelled at her to do the dishes. Gracie also doesn't hang out with kids her own age. At her birthday party it was obvious that the people who were invited were Susie's friends and their children, not Gracie's. 

When we go out to dinner with Susie, Gracie, and Chase, she never lets Gracie have soda and dessert. This might be fine, but she lets Chase eat anything that he wants. Gracie is only allowed fruit for dessert. Susie ordered a cup of soup for Gracie to eat and hamburger sliders for Chase to eat. When Gracie asked to have a bite of the hamburger, Gracie was only allowed to eat the patty not the bun. As you can already see, Susie controls Gracie's diet. Whenever we are babysitting Susie's kids, my family tries to make them eat as much as possible. They are just bones and skin, but for some reason they barely eat (more specifically Gracie doesn't eat) at our house. This is concerning to me, because Gracie looks unhealthy. 

Last year I was browsing on facebook, I saw pictures of Gracie getting her head shaved and they were posted by Susie. Gracie looked really unhappy in the picture (as if she was crying) and her mother said it was for Charity. In the comments people praised Gracie for being such a brave little girl, but then Susie made a comment that bothered me. Susie said something along the lines of it's better than Gracie pulling out her hair for nothing. 

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I have trichotillomania, meaning when I get stressed I pull out my hair. But that's not all, Gracie still pees her pants at school. I believe it's because of Susie that she still does this. At school, Gracie must be made fun of because of this problem. 

Speaking of school, Gracie is very behind. She tells Susie that she doesn't like school at all. Gracie is a really fast reader. Faster than I am. I think she loves school, but she tells her mom she hates it to piss her mother off. To give you some context, my entire family is very proud of intelligence, so school is a very big deal (yeah, yeah Asians love their education). 

Is there anything I can do to help her? My parents told me there isn't, but there has to be a way. I'm scared that if I get involved it will break the family apart. I was physically and emotionally abused by my mother, and now I go to a really good university, but I still have terrible anxiety problems. I just don't want Gracie to have problems and I feel like she is going down bad path by not doing well at school.  I don't know what to do. Please help.

16660,Non-Romantic,3eqpt5,"Mid to late last year I loaned a good friend of mine three of my valuable yoga text books. She was beginning to get into yoga herself and wanted to learn more. 

I loaned them with emphasis placed on the fact that these were text books that I refereed to often as a teacher and would need them back as soon as she was finished with them. 

It took forever for her to give them back. One she took on a trip around Europe. I would remind her often by prefacing my inquiries with So are you enjoying the books? and sometimes more blatantly Are you nearly done with the books?

Often she would say yes she was nearly done but oh no she forgot to bring them with her. Then she moved and they were packed away so she couldn't give them back just yet...

Recently I have moved country so before I did I was determined to get all three of them back. So I pestered her to get them out of storage before I left.

I got two of them back. One is in pretty shoddy condition. Another not too bad. The other one she lent to a friend of hers. 

Am I right in feeling completely pissed about what feels like a blatant disregard for my kindness and my possessions. 

I have just sent her another message asking her could she please get onto sending me my book back and I am unhappy she loaned it to someone else without telling me. I cannot help feeling though that it's long gone.

I bought my first house last year and I have been renovating it since. One of my superiors at work who is also a work friend (he visits me during the work day and we go for drinks occasionally but never hang out outside of work) lent me a few tools at various times. First it was a jumbo shop vac before I could afford my own, and then an ancient black and decker sander. 

Anyway, a couple weeks ago I break out the sander and within 5 minutes of reasonable use (sanding a flat stair surface) it sparks and lights on fire! It was fried so I had to rent one to finish the task.

The next work day I told him what happened and he said it's an old sander, it can be replaced. I'm glad nothing more serious happened. Then a few days later he made a joke about when I was going to buy him a new one.

So here is my problem - is it reasonable for me to have to buy him a new sander when I was just unlucky enough to be the one using it when it bit the dust from old age? Brand new, the tool would cost about $70-$100 and the reason I borrowed it was because I couldn't afford to buy one new what with student loans still ruining my life. In addition, this guy makes about $300g a year and has taken multiple international vacations this year whereas I am scraping by with my expenses.

I'm thinking about giving him the tool back with $20 or else seeing if I can find another super old sander on kijiji. Am I bring reasonable? I have no idea. Help!

16672,Non-Romantic,3gkb4f,"This is a bit of a long story, but I'm going to do my best to abbreviate as much as I can because I could really use some advice on how to move forward with this situation. I'm 33, married, and have a 6 year old daughter and a 4 year old son. I've lived in the city where I currently reside for about 16 years (I moved here to go to college and be closer to my Father and Sister. I lived with my Mom while in high school and after I graduated and moved she also moved, but to a different city on the other end of the country) and for the first 13 of those years my local family consisted of my Dad, my Sister and her husband, and my Godparents (two extremely close friends who have been like family my entire life). We've all had a pretty decent relationship with each other, though there have been strains from time to time, especially between my sister and my dad. We would all get together for major events (birthday's, holidays, etc) and would frequently make time to do one on one stuff every couple weeks or so.

 

Anyway, about 3 years ago, when my kids were 3 and 1 my Mom decided she was tired of being so distant from her grandkids (my sister had a baby at that time) and moved to town. She said she was tired of missing so much and that this was where she wanted to be. She bought a big house, with a pool, and very quickly that house became the center of family activity. All of us would go over there for random get togethers, birthdays, holidays, pool parties, etc.. We would typically be over there 3-4 times a month and she encouraged us to come over even more. She would have my kids over for sleepovers and long weekends and very quickly became an integral part of the kids (and mine) lives.

 

Flash forward to now, she told us about a month and a half ago that she was considering moving back to the other side of the country (from Texas to Illinois). The main reason she gave us is that her partner couldn't stay in her current job anymore. Her partner works in a pretty high paying job right now but it requires her to split her week between 2 different cities that are 4 hours apart. It's, admittedly, very tough on them being seperated from each other so much and it's not a situation that could go on much longer. Her partner's options were to find a different job in town that could potentially pay less or transfer within her company to a position in Illinois that pays the same. Other reasons that she gave us were that she currently works remotely in her job and wants to work out of the office (which is in Illinois) so she can be close to her co-workers, the political situation in Texas (not very friendly to gay couples), weather, and allergies. Their plan was to, essentially, move back to Illinois in order to maintain their current level of income and then try to visit us down her as often as possible.

 

Our counter-argument to this was that, by moving, she would be giving up her opportunity to really watch her grandkids grow up. She'd be missing 90% of the good stuff by only being her for big get-togethers and that we, and especially the grandkids, would miss them terribly. We had a big family meeting which didn't go very well. The rest of us were making some pretty heavy emotional appeals and they left feeling pretty beat up. That whole thing could probably have been handled better, for sure.

 

So, about 2 two weeks ago, they announced that they were going to go ahead and sell their house and move as soon as her partner had secured a job. The situation as it stands is that their house is for sell and her partner is still looking. They are planning to get a short-term apartment in the area where they will stay until a job is secured and they've bought a house up in Illinois.

 

She broke the news to my kids about a week ago and initially they handled it well but it's been really bothering my 6 year old daughter since then. She's been crankier and asking a lot of questions. You can tell that she realizes all the things that she isn't going to get to do anymore and it breaks my heart. My 4 year old son has pretty much just been carrying on as usual, thankfully.

 

As for myself, since I received the e-mail announcing their decision, I've been incredibly pissed off. To the point where it's been hard to focus on anything else. She asked us to see things from their perspective and to understand that this is a business decision (that's an exact quote). So, instead of going right out and telling her how angry I am, I've been trying to do just that and to see things from their perspective but I've failed. I can't fathom any job or dollar amount that is worth giving up the opportunity to read my daughter a good night story and to be the last one she sees before she goes to sleep, or to spend time building LEGO figures with my son, or any number of other countless quiet moments with the kids that you just can't experience at a big get-together. I just can't understand why she is willing to give that up. I can't understand why she's willing to leave her own kids when our relationship with her has grown so much in the last couple of years. And to do all this for a job and some money. It makes no sense to me. Does she think being 1000 miles away is that same as being 20 minutes away? Does she not see a difference between the two? Did she realize this isn't the kind of Grandma she wants to be?

 

I haven't talked with her at length about all this since they made their final decision. There are times where I want to do it immediately but then there are times where I'm just not sure what good it would do. I imagine it would definitely make her feel bad about the decision (as far as I've been able to tell she doesn't really feel bad about it, downright excited really) and I don't know if it would really make me feel any better. I also don't know if I would ever really be able to get answers to all the questions I have and I'm nervous about what answers I might get.

 

So, my questions to yall are these...would you confront her with your anger? Am I unreasonable for feeling like this? For the grandparents, could you ever find a reason that would make you want to move away from your grandkids if you were already right next to them? For the parents, how would you help your little kids through this? And does anyone else have any other advice that might help me move on and being to re-focus on the other, many, positive things in my life?

16683,Non-Romantic,1slx82,"I'll try to explain briefly.  My mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness back in 2009.  I move in to help take care of her a couple years ago, and my responsibilities are becoming ridiculous.  She is in a wheelchair and completely dependent on other people for all her care.

I have very much put my entire life on hold for this.  I had to quit my job and I lost about 90% of my social life.  Many of my friends don't bother contacting me at all because they know most of the time I can't come do anything.  The only thing I have for myself is school, and even that is becoming difficult because of my step dad.

My step dad is a piece of work.  If he had his way I would quit school (my only source of income and independence btw) and stay home 24/7.  He complains every time he has to do something and makes passive aggressive remarks nearly every time I leave the house (Gee, I remember when I got to have a social life. Ironic since I was going to school).  I am literally home every day of the month except for 4.  I get every other weekend off, that I spend at my bf's house to get a break.  My step dad is constantly complaining that he never gets a break, but he has 2 days a week off work where he does nothing.  Even on work days he just comes home and does nothing (he works in an office, for context).  He only takes care of my mom on the weekends that I'm gone.

My little brother also lives at home now, but does nothing.  He's never even home except to sleep and shower.  He's blatantly taking advantage of not having to pay rent and spending most of his time smoking weed where he used to live.  I'm extremely pissed that he just gets a free ride while all this is laid on me.  My older sister is in med school a few hours away, so it's not like she can drop everything to help out.

I've tried talking to everyone several times, saying I need more time to have a life and that I'm being taken advantage of.  Things always get better for a couple days, but then go right back to the way they were and then I'm made to feel extremely guilty by my step dad for going out.  I keep saying that they NEED to hire help.  I NEED help.  If he would throwing his money away on various things (eating out, guns, knives, expensive painting supplied (he thinks he's Bob Ross now)) they could easily afford part time care.  I have mentioned several times that I would like to move out and have my life back because this is too much.  

It's gotten to the point where if anything happens the automatic solution is for me to take care of it.  My grandma sometimes stays while I'm at school and says she can no longer do it, so my education is being threatened because the automatic solution is that I'll now need to stay home.  I told them they need to find a different solution because I will not quit school.

I've been giving them these warnings to try to get them to get their shit together for months because I can't take it anymore.  I recently broke out into a rash that turned out to be pityriasis rosea, doc said brought on by my extreme stress.  So now the next 6 weeks I also get periodic fatigue, nausea, headaches and a lovely itchy rash.  Not to mention it's finals week.

The boyfriend and I really want to move in together by next April.  I want my life back.  I want my freedom, I want to work.  People don't seem to understand that I'm 27 and I should be living.  I have been told by my own family as well as other caregivers (who are all twice my age) to suck it up and get over it.  That's easy for them to say since I'm doing all the work.  There's probably going to be backlash from people telling me I'm a selfish person for abandoning my mom, but I can easily help out several days a week without living here and basically being a slave.

I'm planning on telling them I'm leaving after Christmas so they have a few months to organize care. I need to hear it from other people.  Am I being selfish for wanting my life back?  Am I selfish for taking these actions?

16684,Non-Romantic,2wop7b,"   Hold on to your butts, this may be long. Some of you may dismiss this because you
 think I just have teenage angst, and if that's the case feel free to. I've been living with this for a 
while now and I don't know what to do, if anything. This is mainly just for me to get this out and 
possibly get better myself.


   Background: Both of my parents are psychologists. It's not as bad as it could be, but they've 
said that they can't turn off the psychologist in them, and that they are almost always analyzing. 
Sometimes it's a good thing, like when my mother gives me advice on things, or it can also be 
really bad, like when we're in a fight and they say something that insults me to the core. He's 
gotten a lot worse in the past few years, and we are unsure of why. He runs a successful therapy 
business, while my mom is getting licensed for clinical therapy.



   When I grew up, both of my siblings argued and disagreed with him. I haven't been 
different. He has had a bad childhood, but he blames it on all of his irrational behavior. For 
example, he gets angry if someone stands behind him, as apparently his brothers would hit him in 
the back of his head. I dread the weekends when he is home, and I am reluctant to go anywhere 
with him. It's a mixture of how he acts to me, how he acts in public, and past grievances. 


   His behavior is terrible and he pushes these bad behaviors on others, like if I have a friend over, he'll push my friend to eat more and more (he’s always eating). You know how a parent always bring up tone? Yeah, I envy some of you, I can't talk to him without him bringing it up. For example, he'll said Jack I responded What?  He then said that  I'd wish you'd respond with a Yes dad? or a How can I help you?. 

   I can't disagree with him either. For example, one night my mom made dinner for us, nothing bad about that, and later that night he came home. The next day my mom hadn't cleaned up from the previous night, and he decided to chew me out about it. He came to my room and started yelling at me about cleaning the kitchen when I am done cooking. I immediately told him that I hadn't cooked, and that mom was the one who last cooked. He got angry at me for interrupting him and started yelling at me again.
 
   I told him I wasn't going to sit here and let him yell at me for something I didn't do, he got even angrier. Luckily my mom came and backed me up. He looked at both of us and walked away. The rest of the day was spent with him huffing standing in the living room angrily looking at us as we did whatever we did. We knew not to say anything to him or he'd start getting really angry. He later apologized, as he always does, but he has no intention of changing it.

   He's never physically abused us, but he's threatened it. He's incredibly manipulative emotionally. In the middle of an argument with my mother he'll start to cry and say he's sorry. If he says he'll change he might try for a week before going back to his own ways. He also tries to compliment me way too much, like two or three times a day. It's to the point of where I can't believe anything he says about me, and if he compliments me I may end up thinking the opposite.

   Now I know that I haven't been helpful to the situation, I try my best to avoid him and I have no interest in a relationship with him. My mom insists I shouldn't argue with him, or disagree if I know it'll lead to an argument, but if I see him driving in the middle of the road, or if he is being racist and insulting to people I will disagree with him. 

   Final thing, He has an intense hatred for people who disrespect him. A recent event shows this well, we were in Canada (a terrible trip, it was just him bitching about the driving) and we were searching for a parking spot. We found a person pulling out and signaled to show we were going to take it. Some girl and her friend took it from us. Dick move, but whatever. He got enraged and stopped his car right behind the teenage girls as he angrily staring at them.We yelled at him until he left, he said they were lucky we were here as he was going to follow them in there and yell at them.

   It's not as bad as you might think it is, as I obviously only said the bad parts, but it's a big problem in my life. I can't trust him or anything he says, and I just need to get this out, and maybe some advice. Thanks.

16696,Non-Romantic,2iqi6f,"Hey, /r/relationships! Just wondering if I could get your perspective on a neighbor noise-complaining situation. Backstory: I recently (under a month ago) moved to a new apartment in a condo building. (Renting from the owner.) The building is older – like ca. 1940s with creaky hardwood floors – but has been updated with new appliances, had good upkeep, etc. 


On my first night in the apartment, a Saturday, I was still unpacking boxes at the admittedly late hour of 1 am. I promise I was trying to be quiet while I continued to break down boxes and unpack my kitchen, but then I hear a knock at my door. 


A middle-aged woman (mid-50s?) stood in front of my open door, squinty eyed and annoyed looking. 


“Hi, I live downstairs, and I know you just moved in, but could you knock it off for the night? It’s really loud,” she said. 


“Oh, sorry about that! I’m winding down now,” I replied. 

A few weeks go by with no sign of the lady – until tonight. I’ve been gone 2 out of the 3 weekends since I’ve lived here and haven’t yet had a chance to hang my pictures. (You can see where this is going.) Around 9:15 pm, I hung 2 larger pictures on my living room wall (in the middle of the apartment with no adjacent exterior walls to any other units). After some time looking at my not-so-handy work, I rehung one of the pictures at 10:15. 


Around 10:45, I hear a knock at the door and of course it’s my downstairs neighbor. 


“Hi again. I noticed you haven’t really seemed to slow down and it’s still noisy downstairs,” she said. “I’m not sure if you know how this apartment works, but there’s no insulation in between floors and it’s really loud.”


I responded super apologetically as she continued.


“I mean, if it was up to me, I would stay up till 3 am every night and sleep until 10 or 11 if I could, but that’s not how the world works,” she said. “I mean, the other night, I think it was Sunday, it was like you were racing around up here – back and forth.” 


I explained to her I was away on Sunday and she quickly backpedaled and said perhaps it was Monday, which I helpfully explained it may have been since that’s when my boyfriend and I arrived home from an out-of-town trip around midnight after our flight had been delayed several hours. Our “racing around” couldn’t have been anything more than rolling the luggage across the hardwood floor to the bedroom. 


Now, I admit that I’m a late-night person, but I play music at a super-low volume if at all and the most vigorous activity I’ve performed at my apartment to-date is walking around, and perhaps that luggage-rolling incident. And I wake up for a day-job around 7 am, leaving the house by 9, so it’s not like I’m some late-nite party-animal who sleeps until noon.


“I understand you have every right to live here too, but we need to come up with a solution,” she said.


I politely but curtly replied that I’d definitely try to be quieter and said goodnight. 


Reddit, I’m annoyed. I honestly don’t feel like I’m being unreasonably loud. Yes, I may keep later hours than some of the other working stiffs out there, but to my understanding, part of apartment living is dealing with the normal activity levels of neighbors. I mean, I don’t get twisted when I hear a baby crying, TV at a loud volume, and dogs barking when people walk in front of their doors, etc. And overall, regardless of time of day, my activities are never at a loud volume. In my estimation, the only real objection this lady can make is to me moving about my apartment during generally accepted quiet hours, say, 10pm-7am (which is when my next door neighbor’s construction began yesterday, for example). 


I’m not trying to have any unpleasant neighborly (or otherwise) relationships, but I’m also don’t want to feel like I have to walk on proverbial eggshells in my own damn apartment. I’m thinking of baking her cupcakes and giving her a pack of foam earplugs. Good idea? Bad? How would you approach this situation?

16701,Non-Romantic,26nv7u,"**BACKGROUND:** I am marrying a wonderful man, Miguel [33], at the end of this year (together 4 years). We couldn't be happier. We are planning a wedding with about 100 people- and give or take 55 people will be from my giant family, with an added 15 from my very closest friends and their spouses/SOs. Miguel has a very small family (which is ironic, culturally), plus many are from South America and will be unlikely able to attend (though invitation will be extended). So he has about 20 close friends (their partners added into that number) but only 10 family members likely to attend. 

Basically, our 100 guests, while it may seem large, are the closest people to us. My father was very generous and offered us a budget of $8000. We live in the US in a top 15 population. We have figured out having an afternoon wedding, heavy hors d'oeuvres and limited beer/wine for a bar, we've been discount shopping decorations and doing most DIY. We've decided venue/food/liquor are the big 3 for us to spend on, and have been trying to keep everything as low cost as possible, yet fun for our guests. My dress cost a whole $150- but I'm sooo excited about it!

**THE CONFLICT:** Miguel's older brother, Diego, had his 2nd wife ask for a divorce after 10 years of marriage in November. They live about a third the country away, about 450 miles (about 725 kilometers). Diego was blind-sided, and we were all heart-broken for him. He had adopted her children legally. He had called Miguel and his parents with suicidal indications in November. We find out later that his wife had left him for another man. Come December of 2013, he had suddenly fallen head over heals in love with Sarah. Sarah [maybe 40ish?] and he met god-knows-where (still in his hometown though), and she has 5 children, 4 of which are under 12 years old, and in January that Miguel and I first catch wind of them wanting to be invited to our (smallish) wedding. We decide to wait the relationship out.

A few days ago, my fiance Miguel gets a facebook message from Sarah saying call your brother (Diego) ASAP. So Miguel calls Diego and is concerned about the many health issues in the family, only to discover that Diego was in fact calling to make sure that 1. He is invited to our wedding (yes, Miguel wants him to be the best man, actually) and 2. That Sarah and her children (the +6) will be invited. 

Miguel and I had talked before this, in the off chance it may come up, so he was at least prepared for the conversation with Diego. Miguel told him that my parents were generously giving us the money for the wedding,and we had been planning based on the number we had planned for. Also, though 100 seems like a lot, considering the number of people in my immediate family, it is not that many (my siblings have 3-6 kids each, for example, and we want the kids there). We had always planned on giving him a +1, we had not planned on adding 5 more children to the party, at $25 a head. 

**THE DILEMMA:** While Diego thought that was a reasonable financial point as to why we shouldn't pay for the kids to attend, he said that they would pay for them to attend. 

Miguel also reminded him that there would be added expenses to plan for. Their parents would be paying for the rehearsal dinner, and with the traditional wedding party (3 each for bride and groom) and their SOs, plus out of town guests, they are looking at 25 people total (minimum, some out-of-towners might say yes) on their parents limited income. Another 6 people would bring it to 31, minimum. Plus hotel, plus any meals they would need.  

**QUESTION:** So my question is: if Diego is fine with paying for the extras and paying for their way into the wedding, should I let it go and okay it? My fiance, by the way, is furious and finds it all extremely tacky, and does not want them there. 

I am coming from the other side- I'm trying to make sure that his family knows I make them a priority and am willing to work with their needs. I am, however, a little afraid that if they are the kind of people who think it's fine to invite themselves into someone else's wedding, then how will they act?

I'm very grateful for all of the advice and support I have received. I thought I would post a small update, but I'm going to clarify a few things first. 

- Her husband is in a cancer facility located a few hours away. She goes to see him every other weekend. My parents usually watch her children at that time. 

- Those weekends were the only times the kids were around for the past year or so... until I moved back, which is right when they started camping out here. 

- My sister has her own house, given to her rent free by her in laws. It is older and has some problems, which is her excuse for being here all the time lately. 

Yesterday, when (believe it or not) my sister and her kids weren't here, I went to talk to my mother about what happened. She didn't know anything about the nasty texts that my sister had sent me, but she seemed offended that my husband had talked to her. My sister made it out like my husband was rude and offensive, which he was not (I heard the entire conversation). My mom then started in on me, calling me spoiled, selfish, etc because I needed sleep. Mothers can function on only 2-3 hours of sleep so I know you can too! was her reasoning. I went upstairs, livid. My husband talked me down and we both went down together to talk to my mom. He pointed out how much time and effort we have put into her kids and how upset we are by what happened. My mom actually apologized and said she wanted us to get along but would no longer get involved. She wants us to stay in the house and says she'd prefer if my sister and her kids didn't spend so much time here but she doesn't feel like she can say no. 

I took my awesome guy out to dinner and did some errands. We returned later in the evening... and saw my sister's vehicle. Yep, here again. She and my mother were in the living room. The front door opens to the kitchen, where the children were sitting. They greeted us shyly (NOT common for them) and my nephew asked my husband if we hated them. We were shocked and said Of course not, who would tell you that?. From the living room, my sister screamed at them to come in there right away or they would be in trouble. I was so angry that I was shaking, but again I knew that a confrontation at that time would be a huge blow up (in front of the children) and I didn't want them to see that, so we went upstairs. I had a message from my older sister to call her, so I did. 

My younger sister had spoken to her earlier in the day. Her version of events was that I sent my husband to yell at her and insult her (not true, I heard the entire conversation) about her kids being too loud at 8pm (not 8pm, past 11pm). She didn't mention any of the insulting texts or the fact that I had talked to her earlier in the day and texted her before my husband went to talk to her regarding the noise level. I sent my older sister the nasty texts and the other texts with the time stamp to prove that she was lying. Her point of view is that I should be offended, but I should also be the bigger person and try to reconcile. I disagree, and I think that doing so would just validate her and her lies, as well as her disgusting manipulation of her children. 

I have respected my younger sister's wishes to never speak to her again, and am happy to continue to do so in the future. 

We are working hard to find a rental property ASAP, and my husband has a promising job prospect, so at least there's a little bit of good news. 

I honestly can't believe my sister is behaving like this. When you travel abroad and spend a lot of time away from home, you expect that you will change. It seems that she has changed too, very much for the worse. It's unfortunate.

16763,Non-Romantic,2uvxzk,"Hello everyone, I live in a shared house in London which is hugely common here due to how expensive rent is and I’ve been in my current place for about 2.5 years. The house is comfortable, convenient for my work/social life, affordable, and my landlord is a delight to deal with. All of those things are so difficult to find in this city which is why I’m reluctant to just move out as I’m guessing a lot of you will suggest I do. I would most likely end up somewhere more expensive, dealing with a nightmare rental agency and maybe still having the same problems I list here.

I live with 3 other females, two of which work full time (27&amp;28) and one is a postgrad student (31). Personality wise they are lovely, friendly and fun, but to live with they are really difficult. We are all grown ups, yet somehow I have to remind them not to leave dirty dishes lying around the house for days on end. We have a cleaning rota where each person has a different task each week, but unless I keep telling them they have to do their chores they just don’t do them. We have one bathroom and one kitchen for the 4 of us and with such heavy use both get very dirty and need to be cleaned at least once a week, but somehow I’m the only one who notices that the taps are crusted with toothpaste and soap, or that mildew is growing on the shower curtain. 

I’m actually a pretty chilled person in many regards, but I’m finding the pressure of being the only person coordinating all of the cleaning efforts is starting to get to me. Currently one of my housemates has a friend living in our living room for a couple of weeks before she moves into her own place and the room is a tip. None of us have any issue with friends staying with us so long as they contribute to bills and clean up after themselves, but this girl hasn’t been tidying her bedding etc away during the day and room has lost its function as a space for all of us.

When I sent a group message to remind everyone that the guest should fold the bed away when she isn’t sleeping in it I had people get defensive “oh, (other housemate) has been ill/stressed so that’s the last thing she was thinking about”. Another girl keeps leaving the house and forgetting to turn off the water heater, or the electric heater in her bedroom! 

I’m starting to feel like a bossy tyrant, when really I’m having to remind people to do normal things that they shouldn’t need reminding of. I feel like a mum living with messy teenagers. It’s getting fucking exhausting. I’m tempted to go on strike and stop cleaning or reminding them to do anything, but really I’m not that childish and actually want to live in a nice environment. We all work hard, have busy lives and get stressed or ill, even a bit down at times, but I don’t see those as reasons to not contribute to the care of the space we all live in.

This is probably more of a rant than looking for advice, I feel like I’ve tried everything at this stage. But if anyone has been in this situation and found a solution that actually worked I’d be delighted to hear it. At the minute I’m longing for the day when I earn enough to leave them all in their own mess and go live by myself.

16773,Non-Romantic,24yz61,"Now I know this isn't a big problem at all and it sounds a little petty compared to some of the other things in this subreddit, but it's been bothering me for a while.

Both my roommate and I are in very competitive graduate degree programs in science, so I totally understand stress and unnecessary bitching and attitude and boring lifestyles. We've both always been flexible with each other about these things. Our personalities and even our appearance is so similar that people often mistake us for each other. We *always* get are you guys sisters/twins/related? from absolute strangers.

For the past three years, we have always had a bunch of mutual friends and then friends of our own. This past year, we moved away to a different apartment that's a little further from our other friends for miscellaneous housing reasons. The result is that we barely ever see our other friends and we got into the habit of eating dinner together *every single night*. Which is great, really. I love coming home to someone to eat with. But then, that turned into us doing *everything* together. Which turned into people confusing us and treating us like the same person.

So basically, if I'm going out for my friend's birthday, I'll bring her anyway just because I feel bad leaving her. If she's going to her friend's place, she'll invite me for (I'm guessing) the same reason. Usually it's not really a problem because she's great to get along with and she's my best friend.

Now, it's a weird situation because, although I'm excluded from my other friends, my relationship with my roommate is exacerbating the problem. I feel weird and bad going out somewhere without inviting her because I'm usually ditching her completely by herself. She has a tendency to judge basically everyone in my life (and even her own), so I feel like she doesn't even like some of the people I'm seeing. Usually I bring her and then she bitches about my friends or what happened (It was a waste of time, that was boring, she was annoying). The worst part is that then *I* start getting pissed off about whatever we did and I get all negative about it. If you pick apart any friends outing enough, there's a lot to be pissed off about haha. But I also don't know how not to invite her because sometimes she assumes an invite. 

This means that people are constantly making comments like are you guys always together? And then, because of our appearance, people always confuse us too and don't think of either of us as an individual. I've had guys interested in me who have to double check my name because she and I are together so much. 

She's my best friend and I think a lot of this is happening because we're absurdly close and she's like a sister to me.

long story short: my boyfriend and I have been dating for around three years and living together for one year. We're both 24 and are very happy in general. 

His parents are divorced and I really love his mom and siblings. His father and I used to get along fairly well but I feel things are heading south. 

If you look under foot in the mouth in a dictionary you will see a picture of him. He's is incredibly clumbsy with words and I know that. However, lately it's been getting worse, presumably because we have been spending lots of time together (lots of birthdays and special occasions). 

It often starts with him trying to be funny. We can hanging out after dinner and he will say something Holy moly, you eat like &gt;boyfriend&lt;, no wonder you're built so sturdy. 

After a while, he might bring up my boyfriends ex and talk about her for a while. Nice memories. Lovely memories. You wouldn't know though, cuz you were not there, you know.  

And on it goes. Last night I kind of had enough when he started making bad jokes about girls my boyfriend was seeing before me. It's just degrading to all of us. I made my point by changing the topic rather loudly. He went dead silent for the rest of the night.

16791,Non-Romantic,39dejo,"I've been looking for a house for almost 2 years. I never quite found what I was looking for, but always thought I wanted a cheap, small home in an area that would be easy to rent to college students in case I ever moved on and wasn't able to sell. Because my requirements were low and I figured I wouldn't be too in love with the place, I told my friend of 5 years that she could always move in with me. She had recently moved back in with her parents after a forced job change.

Fast forward to last Christmas, I found the perfect house - it was everything I never realized I wanted and it was a foreclosure that needed a TON of renovations. I've been working with my stepdad and some of his friends to fix everything up: new flooring, new kitchen cabinets, new bathrooms. I've put so much time and work and love into it...and the idea of having her move in (she's a bull in a china shop kinda person), makes me want to throw up.

But not only am I afraid that she won't take care of my home because she's clumsy, I also believe that she simply won't care or take it seriously. She has a fairly large dog that she thinks should have 100% access to everything. I mentioned no dogs on the new sofa my Mom gave me, and she laughed and said except mine. I even mentioned that a rule was food and drink only on the deck or in the kitchen, and she laughed and said like that's going to happen! Leading up to this monumental event in my life, she would get incredibly frustrated if I ever wanted to talk about going to see a house or putting an offer on a house. Unless you bought it, I don't really care... and when I would get hurt, she'd say Well, because I don't want to get emotionally attached! Not because I don't really care... She bosses me around most of the time we hang out, and if she starts to develop new friendships and doesn't need me to keep her company anymore, she just stops picking up the phone. We are currently in a period where she's not picking up. She just started a relationship, and simply cannot be bothered.

Unfortunately, the last time I saw her, she mentioned she had already picked a weekend to move in! *I* don't even have a weekend that I'm moving in, because the renovations aren't even finished yet. A few weeks ago, we discussed that it was maybe a month more of work, and so she picked the week after that to move in, apparently. So she is definitely still planning on moving in.

I've honestly been doing some soul searching and soul cleaning in the past few months, and I really don't think it is a friendship I even want to keep, let alone have living with me. I know that the conversation will turn abusive and accusatory if I have it, so I'm terrified and don't know how to handle it. I wish it were as easy as saying Well, I decided to live alone and then just let the friendship dwindle...but I know that even that explanation will cause drama and anger. Whether or not she even truly wants this, if someone removes her right to have something or makes a decision for her - she gets upset.

Any advice?

**tl;dr**: Promised a long time friend that she could move in with me if I bought a home. Now that I've bought a home, I afraid of her trashing it, and don't want her to move in. I've always thought that if you have a friendship that ends, it is because you didn't try hard enough - so I often hold on to friendships that are toxic because I can't find the line... How do I break this off as painlessly as possible?

**edit**: Thanks everyone for your advice. I have chosen to text her that I've made the decision to live alone. I know that it won't be easy at first, but it will be better for me in the long run to cut that out of my life.","I [28/F] just bought a house, and changed my mind on letting my friend [28/F] move in with me.",0.0,False,35.0,26.0,1433983148.0,/r/relationships/comments/39dejo/i_28f_just_bought_a_house_and_changed_my_mind_on/,NonRomantic
16799,Non-Romantic,3cqxo8,"About 13 years ago, my father started dating a woman (we’ll call her Ann [46/F]) after divorcing my mother [48/F] about three years prior. Initially, I got along with Ann fairly well until she had accepted an offer from my father to move in with him within months of dating (before I continue, when my parents divorced, joint custody was agreed upon so during each week, half of the week I spent with one parent while the other half of the week I spent with the other parent). At that point, that’s when our relationship started going downhill.

During the eight years Ann, my father, and I lived together, she had done things such as steal a significant amount of money from me multiple times, convinced relatives that I was “uncontrollable” and “a bad influence”, felt that she was in the position to label me as an “accident baby”, called the police multiple times because she felt “unsafe” around me, would starve me at times and claimed that I “had enough meat on my bones”, would yell at me at the top of her lungs over small things I didn’t do (such as a dent being in her trash can or her dog knocking over a glass cup), made me cry in front of family during Thanksgiving, and even went as far as trying to get me kicked out of high school a month before graduation because she felt that my parents were planning on getting back together (this specific scenario occurred two years after she had moved out). My father’s responses to all of these scenarios ended up being the usual, “Well, you shouldn’t have upset her just like you did during (insert previous scenario)” and “Nobody’s going to believe you because you’re a kid and we’re adults” and if he rarely happened to know that he was 100% wrong, he’d simply tell me to shut up. I would try to talk to my mother during these times to let her know what was going on (who even admitted that there was something “off” about Ann) via in-person, however, when it came to calling my mother, a few times my father would physically prevent me as he felt that I “needed to quit being a momma’s boy”. The fact that my father allowed these scenarios to occur during those eight years is part of the reason why I have trouble forgiving him and have hatred built up towards him. However, most of my hatred and lack of forgiveness towards him is in the next paragraph.

After Ann had moved out about five years ago, my father and I’s relationship was “meh”. However, that all changed around a year and a half ago when he had threatened to kill my dog over urinating on the floor. Now before this, I had always been slightly submissive when my father would show signs of physical aggression because I had always felt that it’s wrong to argue with fists rather than words. During this scenario, I became tired of submitting to him as I felt that I had never achieved any progress between my father and I so when he told me to shut up, I said no, and that set off a fuse inside him. He backed me into a corner and said “I’m gonna lay your ass out on the kitchen floor”. I told him if he did, I’d call the police and have him arrested for assault. He backed away and told me to get out of the house. When I left the house, all I had on me was the clothes on my back and my wallet (he took my keys and phone so during the few minutes I had to compose myself, I texted as many friends as I could to let them know I needed transportation (was able to text my mother and let her know about the situation but she was unable to pick me up as she lived too far away and wasn’t able to drive as I was borrowing his car)). I was able to stay at a friend’s house that night and went back the next day (I had no money during this time because I was jobless and had dropped out of college a couple months prior due to being depressed over the loss of my grandmother).

That next day was spent with my father badgering me about how I needed to learn some respect and to not think that he won’t kick me out again (he ended up giving me back my phone and the keys a few weeks later). From that point on until about three weeks ago, I had avoided contact with him as much as possible. During the times I absolutely needed to communicate with him, I’d communicate with him in a “monotone” voice. Three weeks ago I had clothes in the dryer I needed to take out (they had been in there for a few hours). Well, my father noticed and was yelling at the top of his lungs about how I apparently don’t want the clothes if I left them in the dryer (these are clothes that I purchased with my own money from a job I had gotten prior to this specific incident), how he should kick me out right then and there, etc.

For a year and a half, I told myself I was going to stand up to my father the next time we got into it and I did. I called him out on everything he’s done and allowed to happen during the past 13 years including the scenarios with Ann, the physical abuse he’s shown to my mother and I, the pathetic reasons for why he’s tried to justify what he’s done, etc. He said he doesn’t care, that he “had a good reason to” justify everything, that he “doesn’t give a fuck” about what happens to me or any family that I potentially start in the future, etc. Afterwards, I left to stay at another friend’s house for two weeks and since then I’ve moved two hours away, closer to my mother.

As of today, I haven’t spoken to my father since my last day there to gather the rest of my belongings (last week). I have so much pure hatred built up towards him because of what he’s done and allowed. A few have said that he still loves me and did it out of love but I honestly feel like that’s not an excuse for his behavior. A few others have said that I needed to be more appreciative because he’s “put a roof over my head and fed me” (but I’m pretty sure you’re supposed to do that if you’re a parent, right?). I feel like I have no reason to forgive him and that if he wants my forgiveness, he should come crawling to me, begging me to stay in his life.

**Here's some back story that you don't have to read:**
For a majority of my childhood I lived on the road with my mother, older and younger brother, and my younger sister. We lived in the car traveling from the MidWest to the Northwest until we were found and forced to live in foster care or with my father. We broke out of foster care/dad's house several times. There seemed to be a reason for this at the time, but now looking back I can see that it was unnecessary and caused a lot of problems. I was taught that mom=good and dad=bad, so I just listened to everything my mother said. It would take too long to explain all of this.

Anyways, we ended up in foster care for several years. Since there were four of us, it was hard to find a home that would take us all. We didn't want to complain or we would end up separated for who knows how long, but the family we were placed with was not that great. The dad pinned me down in the back of his van and rubbed lemon powder flavoring in my eyes and yelled at my one time because I didn't want to try his spicy snack thing. I'm not sure if that's actually abuse because he didn't hit me, but stuff like that sticks with me and I feel like it changed me a lot because that's when I realized they hated me. I was crying and ran upstairs and all the adults acted like it was my fault. Also, I was 12 at the time. 

Anyways, foster care changed my feelings about myself a lot. I had no self esteem anymore. I was very depressed. Even when we got out and went to live with my dad, I was severely depressed. I hid it pretty well though, because I've always been the strong one of the family. I took over as the new mom while we were in foster care. I always comforted and stood up for my siblings. I would get myself in trouble trying to stick up for them. I feel like I went through a lot of feeling terrible about myself for them.

 Then we moved in with my dad and started going to school and my siblings made friends, but I never did. They started getting annoyed with me because I would try to stop them from doing dangerous things. My dad never acted like a dad. He still lives with his parents and sister, all in one house. But even with all those adults, there was nobody paying attention. My little sister would walk all around the neighborhood with no supervision at like 9 years old. My brother and his friends would throw rocks and peoples houses. My mother instincts i guess made me try to keep them out of trouble, but they just started hating me for it because I wouldn't let them do whatever they wanted. I felt like they never realized or appreciated how much I tried to do for them. I kept all my feelings in and stressed myself out so much to keep them thinking positively. 

**Okay that's the end of the back story**

Now it's years later. I'm 18, my older brother is 20, my younger brother 16, and my sister is 12. My parents are STILL having problems even though they were divorced years ago! Anything I do I feel like I'm picking a side. My mom guilt trips me so much, so I always pick her side, but I feel so terrible because I feel like my dad thinks I don't love him. I moved in with my mom at 16 after getting diagnosed with Crohn's disease because the stress of living at my dad's house was too much. Soon after, I dropped out of school. That caused a lot of problems between the whole family. 

My dad puts too much stress on doing well in school, and my mom doesn't care about school at all. They're complete opposites about everything. It makes it hard to do anything without picking a side. My mom doesn't want me to grow up it seems. I'm 18 and I have literally no friends. I can't drive even though I got my permit a year ago because nobody ever has time to teach me how. My plan was to get my GED as soon as I dropped out, but nobody ever took me to even though I studied. We finally made appointments to take it last fall, but of course we had to cancel and still haven't rescheduled. I don't have a job and don't think I can get one now since I'm 18, no job, no GED, no references.
 
I depend too much on other people as an 18 year old. I feel like moving out would crush my mom. Just the other day we got in a fight because she brought up something that I was still mad about from a few years ago, and in my anger I said, Well I'll just move back in with dad then because he won't read my messages and she started crying and was upset the rest of the night. I asked her what was wrong and she said she felt ugh because of what I said about moving. She needs me here, but I'm not going forward with my life at all living here!! 

I get along with my mom really well, and my dad pretty well, but I feel like neither of them actually care about what's in my best interest. They just give me advice that they know the other will hate  in an attempt to win me over.

Also, any friends I've ever had, I'm not friends with anymore. My family gets too jealous of anyone I talk to, like I'm choosing a friend over family. It's because I'm best friends with my family. But I don't want *just* family as friends. I need teenage girl friends. I want a group of non-family friends. Everyone here my age smokes weed though, and my parents would be so disappointed in me for dong that. I really crave friendship though. I'm so lonely. 

My days are spent doing nothing lately. My mom goes to work/ runs errands/ hangs out with her friends all day. I stay at home with my older brother and clean house/ do nothing. It's so boring and lonely and I can't keep doing **absolutely nothing** much longer.

Also I can get a job and not have to worry about house payments or anything because the military will cover that. Keep in mind my financial situation at home is not good. I missed a scholarship by a few points and so I have no money to pay for college. We both know all the paper work and responsibilities that will come with being in an actual gay marriage.

We vision living together in Texas and flirting with girls and all that stuff that 18 year olds do. We also know the costs for divorce later in our life will be a lot. However we think we can save up enough money over time to cover that.

I definately could of typed this a lot better in order for you all to better understand the situation. However I dont have a lot of time at the moment and I plan on editing this a lot and replying to comments. So please keep in mind that there is a lot more thought coming behind this and DONT ASSUME things.

16873,Non-Romantic,3dfyao,"I have been married over 20 years to my DH, Jason, and have dealt with my FIL, Mike, for the duration of our marriage, as well as several years when we were engaged. 

Mike is a chronic complainer. Married repeatedly, he does not seem to understand that his multiple marriages have fallen apart largely due to his poor attitude. A small sampling of what he does:

~is a racist, but pretends not to be. Example- I can't stand THOSE people. They try to take all the jobs! We call him on his racist statement, and he backtracks Oh, I don't hate them, I'm just frustrated! Does not seem to realize that generalizing an entire race or ethnicity by making a sweeping statement is ludicrous. Also is mortifyingly rude at restaurants, one of those who loudly speaks in horrible faux Spanish to ANYONE in a restaurant who has skin darker than his. 

~is a misogynist. Comments make me believe that he thinks the entire role of women is to be pretty and fit, and preferably wealthy. Has nagged his previous wives about their weight and fitness consistently, contributing to divorces. He is no prize either. You could probably braid his arm hair it is so long (Shudder). FYI- the past wives were not fat, healthy weights, just not model thin. Still apparently not thin enough for Mike, although he married them. 

~is homophobic. Told me the other night that gay men make him want to throw up. I told him homophobes make me want to throw up, and we walked out of his house. 

~complains continuously, about everything. His job, his stress level, his wife, his daughter, his income, how he is not rich like his friend, how his wife is not as thin as his friends' wives, ad nauseum. I have not heard him say anything positive in years. 

~prattles incessantly. Never takes a break in his negative monologue. Never lets anyone else speak more than a few words at a time before returning to bitter ranting. 

When we were first married, Jason and I were very young, but we set limits on this behavior. Told him that if he made any nasty remarks about others, we would leave or ask him to leave. We have followed through with this. Can't even tell you the amount of times we have done this. He has not changed. We also limited his whining to five minutes, then tried to change the subject. He relentlessly returns to whining. Years ago, we went very low contact with him as he is incredibly annoying and depressing. 

He did moderate his behavior during that time, and was somewhat pleasant for a period of several years. However, he has returned to his ways. At his age he will not change. Jason has said it is probably time to just go back to very rare contact (ex- maybe once a year). I am on board with this, but my only objection is that Mike did not fully provide for Jason after Mike divorced Jason's mother. Jason felt financially and emotionally abandoned by Mike as a child. I don't want Jason to continue to feel this hurt as an adult, but Jason is leading this change. Just need a few tips for making a clean break, while still supporting Jason. My own father loves Jason as his own son, but I know Jason's heart is breaking that his father is not a decent human and likely never will be.

16876,Non-Romantic,374gis,"So about a year ago, I started working at a small boutique. There is only a small number of employees there, and all of us have become quite close. One of the girls who works there, Ashley, left me with a bad impression when I first worked there. It always seemed she was trying to prove she was better than me. I put up with it and never said anything because I am very non-confrontational (which I am trying to work on). My other co-workers admitted that Ashley can be really high-maintenance and difficult to tolerate at times. 

When she realized I wasn’t a “threat”, she made it her mission to become friends with me. Over the year I have been working, we became closer, due to working so many shifts together (since we both attend the same university, we have classes in the mornings and typically work later shifts together). However, the friendship has always been more from her side. It can be a bit frustrating because I feel Ashley never really listens to me. For example, the other week when I was trying to tell her about a movie I saw with my boyfriend, she cut me off to talk about how depressed she was that she was alone and didn't have a boyfriend to go to the movies with. Usually I just brush things like this off, but lately I feel like she is difficult to work with, as she really doesn't know when to stop talking. Several times she has interrupted me while I am in the middle of helping a customer to tell me something irrelevant, such as a text she got from a guy. I have talked to my manager about this, but nothing really changes. Additionally, she is super sensitive and takes everything personally. If I do tell her that something she did was rude after the customer leaves, she gets all teary-eyed and feels attacked, despite how kindly I word it. Basically, I feel she is self-centered and makes everything about her and has some character flaws that I do not want in a best friend. 

Here is the issue, a couple months I opened up to her that my long-time boyfriend and I had gone engagement ring shopping. This turned out to be a mistake, because last week she put me on the spot by telling me she couldn’t wait to be a bridesmaid. She then confessed to me that if she were to get married tomorrow, two of her best friends she has known for several years and I would be bridesmaids. I was a bit shocked and didn’t really know what to say, so stupidly I just let it go thinking maybe she would forget. Later on, I told another co-worker what happened, and then today that co-worker told me that Ashley was going around telling everyone that I asked her to be a bridesmaid when I get married, which I did not. 

I don’t know what to do. There is a very high chance that I will get engaged while still working part time at the boutique, but I have a handful of close friends who I have always seen as being my bridesmaids. I feel like Ashley would find a way to make my wedding all about her and make me feel guilty me because she is lonely. 

Is it silly to say something? After all, I am not even engaged yet. I feel this is a reflection of a greater problem, because it seems that she thinks we are best friends. I really love my job here, but I just don’t know what to do! She is so sensitive that working with her could be very awkward if I am up front with her. Help, what do I say?


**tl;dr**: My co-worker things she will be a bridesmaid at my future wedding, but I think she can be very selfish and I would not want her in my wedding party.

This morning I was at my desk and he came up and said he needed to talk to me. He was very obviously upset and said all the right things. I said thanks for talking to me, shook his hand, and that was it.

I feel a lot better about it now I guess. Certainly won't be going out with them this weekend or anything but I feel like there's some closure.

Also, we learned a lesson.

---------------------------







My girlfriend and I (we're writing this together) went on a weekend trip with a married couple (&lt; 1year) who we've known for a while but haven't gone anywhere with before. The most we've done is go to their wedding and then hung out at their house a few weeks ago and drank some beers. I work with his wife and he is a personal training client of mine.

Our relationship with this couple was looking very promising as we don't really have any other couple friends who are adventurous and don't have kids, etc. We went to a state championship high school sporting event a few hours away from our hometown. His wife [25F] planned everything and got a hotel with 2 queen beds for us to stay in. After the event we went to 3 different brewery tap-rooms and ended up getting pretty drunk. Everything was going great and our new friendship was really taking off. We got back to the hotel and hit the pool/hot tub for a while while polishing off more growlers of 9% beer. Needless to say we ended up pretty wasted. 

After getting back to our hotel room, I threw up and passed out on a bed and his wife fell asleep in the other bed. My GF and him were in better shape and kept drinking a bit in the bathroom. My GF was saying 'oh we should go run around the halls' or something when he said 'no, no' shut the door with them inside and started saying 'you and me.. (slurring),' with crazy eyes and shit. So my GF tried talking him down by talking about his wife stuff but then he kissed her and she ran out and jumped into bed with me. She told me about it in the middle of the night. 

Since we had ridden up there together we agreed to not mention it and get home before deciding what to do. Obviously my GF has been replaying it in her mind and it becomes more and more traumatizing for her. 

This afternoon he texted her: Hey (name of GF)! (His name) here! I would like to apologise for this wnkd. I had one to many and barely remember what I think I said. My apologies for the bottom of my heart. (his wifes name) and I had a blast this wnkd with you guys. Hope more adventures to come.

Basically we're at a complete loss for how to handle this. She want's to hurt him and I think I'm still in denial or something. She hasn't replied to his text. We don't know if his wife knows, except that she said he becomes an asshole when drunk the next day.

I'm sorry this is rambling so much... not good at stories. Just looking for advice. Thanks.

**tl;dr**: Stayed in hotel with married couple. He closed my GF in the bathroom and kissed her. She's disgusted and I'm pissed. I work with his wife and he's a client.


Update: thanks for all the replies. Definitely won't be pursuing legal action as that seems ridiculous in this situation.  I understand getting that drunk was stupid and it's very rare but we we're having a good time and it seemed innocent enough. Lesson learned. No matter how drunk we we're though that's no reason to blame the victim, even if we should have been less trusting. ","Me [28 M] with my girlfriend [31 F] of 2 years, went out with married friends.

16886,Non-Romantic,2nhe9z,"Hey Reddit.
I'm reaching out to get some much needed perspective on how to deal with my immediate family. This year has been tough. Here are some highlights: 


My brother who is now 32 years old managed in 3 short years to get fired from his job, mooch off my parents for a duration of almost 2 years, corner them into paying off his housing loans so that the bank doesn't reposess his house, get married, have a child, start a business all while crutching on my parents/siblings/friends for support. He is the prodigal child of the family but only in the needy sense, not the repentant sense and I can't help but feeling cheated by his patterns of abuse of attention, especially that all of this was happening in very formative years for me when I refused to ask for help, so as not to burden my parents even more.

My sister who is now 36 struggled with some deep self esteem issues for as long as I can remember. She got into a relationship 4 years ago with a man she adored but she was convinced didn't love her. As it's been my job since I can remember, I've talked her off the ledge for hours at a time, rationalizing, describing scenarios and outcomes, weighing decisions.

Last year I was in a very difficult position during which I needed a lot of help. I got none from her whatsoever and it only occurred to me at that point, how long I had been investing of myself to help her, genuinely and wholeheartedly compared to the treatment I was receiving.

They are both in better places now, my brother with the help of my parents/friends and my sister who is getting married next year - which I can't seem to be happy for due to the circumstances - and I still find myself in the same difficult position.

I don't want to resent either of them and want to get rid of this negativity because it is consuming me and ruining my relationship with them even more.

If you have any advice please share, I could really use it.

16889,Non-Romantic,1p2d4x,"Let me give you a little background first - I got out of my last 2yr relationship on a mutually positive note about 3 months ago, and told myself that it was time for me to focus on my career and just enjoy being single! It may also be worth noting that i have never had problems picking up women or turning my interests into relationships. I've been spending more time with friends and reconnecting with old FWB's so my attention really hasnt been on finding another GF...

Now, about 5 months ago a new girl started at my work and she quickly became recognized as the hot girl in the office. She advertised that she has a BF so I didnt put much more thought into it, that is until I started having longer conversations with her. Turns out she is into just about every hobby and passions that I am (such as cars, racing, art and music), and we share many of the same goals in life...this is very rare for me to come across - and shes a bombshell!

About 3 months ago I offered to help her find cheap tires as I have an old sponsor that gives me great prices. After helping her out I noticed she started to text me on a daily basis just to chat about random thing..she seemed bored outside of work (aka with her BF)...
Some time went by and without thinking I asked if she wanted to meet downtown for dinner. She agreed, and we had what I would consider the best first date ive ever had! 
Things started to progress. We hung out some more, we kissed, even ended up fooling around under the covers...let me say now that I have been very concious that this is something I probably shouldn't be doing. But I really really like her!

My problem now is that we have discussed why she is unhappy with her BF but she is reluctant to break his heart, and wants to slowly convince him that their relationship is not working. From my perspective there isnt much I can do..but I do know that my feelings for her are real! 

Basically I just need some advice. Should I push her to break it off with him? Or just take a back seat and wait until she is single?

Who knows, she could be the one!

16893,Non-Romantic,2j5t9l,"My relationship with my sister is really bad. I'm 5 years older than her and since I was young i always wanted a little brother. I remember my parents leading me on, only to tell me after the birth that it was a girl, which left me really disappointed. I never really played with her, or was sincerely 'friends' with her. I just looked after her, made food for her if my parents went out, and that's about it.


Now, i'm 20, and i'm moving to Germany next year for work, and I may not see her again for quite a long time. Trying to be close to her is really awkward, and conversation just isn't natural (for example, i simply cannot give her a hug, because that feels *really* awkward!). For most of our lives, we've only had small-talk.

I think she cares about me, more than I care about her, despite how cold I am to her. Honestly, after 15 years of apathy towards her (which I don't do intentionally, it just arose out of habit because I never saw the point of a little sister when I was younger), it just seems natural to have a very formal relationship with each other. Though if she disappeared tomorrow, I would really miss her.


Those who have siblings, what is your advice? Thank you

16897,Non-Romantic,1z5uf8,"In Junior year of high school I got into a heated argument with my father, who I already do not get along with. I decided to talk to my school counselor about it and I told her about killing my self. I did not actually mean this, it was all from the frustration I kept inside for so long. She told me it she was required to call social workers to evaluate me to see if I would need to be hospitalized. I was okay with that. 

When the social workers came to talk to me, they tried to put words in my mouth. They would ask me Oh, how did you plan on killing yourself? I answered, I didn't it was just a quick thought from frustration. They would keep prying by saying Oh come on, you're a smart person, you must of thought of something. Same answer. This kept going on, until it I got too annoyed to keep going, so I just said, Drowning, because it's not bloody. They said okay and told me to step out of the room while they chat.

Next thing I know I'm strapped in an ambulance and sent to a hospital for involuntary 72-hour hold. I pleaded and begged, to my counselor, mother and sister, who were present, to not let them take me. My mother literally turned her back on me. I never felt more betrayed in my life. My experience at the hospital was less than stellar. Being treated like a mental patient really bothered me. When I got out I was traumatized and depressed from having lost all support from my family.

When I returned to school I had a hard time readjusting to life, which included AP classes and extra-curricular activities. I was too unmotivated to attend. I resulted to skipping school and curling up in my room and playing video games and chatting with friends which was the only things that kept my mind off of things. As a former Honor Student this came as a shock to my father and lead to more arguments. My mom was kind enough to let me get a PTSD pet, so I adopted a cat. I grew very attached to him and he actually made me very happy. I even returned to school for a few months. But my grades were still falling and I was still ditching school every now and then. My father did not like this so he made my mom return my cat.

Once again, I am alone. This got me so angry. I completely gave up on school, waiting until I was 18. I recently turned 18 this year and I decided to drop out of high school, until the summer, in which I will be attending adult school to receive my diploma. My plan was to use the remaining months to relax with this burden off my shoulders, and even lose all the weight I've gained from hiding in my room.

But now I'm waiting until summer, and I've been trying to ease my mind, but pretty much every night my father would come into my room and say how I'm dicking around with my life and I'm a disgrace, I should go live on the street, I'm worthless, I'm dumb, I can't get my diploma, ect. He's even threatened to kick me out of the house. I don't know what to do.

TL;DR: Loss motivation to go to school from depression, decided to drop out and take my mind off things and attend adult school to get my diploma. Dad says I'm worthless and a disgrace almost every night

16913,Non-Romantic,31a3gf,"My good friend has been dealing with depression and anxiety since the age of 13. She's also struggled with an eating disorder since around the same time as far as I can tell. She's been doing really well with this for the last couple of years, but has recently confessed to me she is starting to feel really obsessive about it in recent weeks. She was raped by a stranger at a party last February and she has serious PTSD as a result. Her longterm boyfriend broke up with her the same week after she told him about the assault, and she now has serious trust and commitment issues. She immediately moved into a relationship with his friend afterwards because he was there to comfort her and they were together for about 10 months. She had a suicide attempt along the way due to the understandable trauma and stress lingering from the rape.

We dated casually in February and early March. I had been planning on leaving the country for months, so we knew it would be a short relationship. This is when I learned about the eating disorder and the rape. The depression and anxiety were already known to me. I feel like I was as compassionate, empathetic and understanding as I could be, and just tried to make her feel safe and let her know I didn't judge her or look at her any differently.

Doing a long distance relationship made no sense considering how brief our relationship at home lasted, and we broke up amicably and mutually. We continued skyping almost daily after I left, and I've been trying to help her deal with being alone. I don't want any relationship advice, because I've accepted that we could not continue dating. But I was wondering if there is anything I can do to offer her support from afar. I mentioned our romantic relationship because it was the only thing that gave me the insight into her true pain and suffering. She wants to learn how to be alone, but has been asked out and is really having a hard time dealing with the attention. After being raped she is very hesitant to trust anybody, but also has an intense desire to feel wanted and loved.

I realize therapy is easily the best option for her. I've had to see a therapist for my own depression and I've found it has helped me tremendously. I've suggested seeking professional help, but she is resistant to trying it again after some bad experiences following her suicide attempt. I don't want to keep pushing the issue, but I have recommended it a few times in the last couple of months.

I know it's not my mission or responsibility to solve all of her problems, and I don't want to get a hero complex or anything like that. But she has complained to me about feeling overwhelmed lately and she has felt comfortable venting to me and sharing her struggles. I don't always want to give her advice or to solve her problems. I know she just wants somebody to listen to her most of the time. But I'd like to know if there is any advice the /r/relationships community has for me to comfort my friend or help her in any way. I hate to see her in this kind of pain, and I'm on the other side of the world and can't be there in person to hang out or be that shoulder to cry on. I care about her a lot and nobody likes seeing a friend in pain.

Most of the time it wasn't much, like 5$ but there were a couple of times when more like 100$ dollars which should have went to pay the bills went missing.

He seemed like a decent person but he was a bit too pleasing and now that I think of it, he sometimes gives the impression that he takes people around him for fools and he thinks somehow he is better than the rest of us.

Now for the past couple of months I noticed my phone bills were a bit too much especially since I got a subscription with virtually unlimited minutes in any cellular network, even internationally. 

So I observed the behavior and I got a detailed bills and I noticed that someone used my phone to recharge his phone credit. I got suspicious and I looked into it and I found that the phone number that the credit was transferred to was his. And the operator at the telephone company told me that it wasn't accidental that someone actually got my phone and did this intentionally. So he has been doing this for almost a year now.

I also noticed that when I was in his room he didn't have any sort of remorse or trouble to check through his room mates belongings.

What should I do with him? I think he did more than just recharging his phone. I noticed that some of my food went missing and he is responsible for paying the bills in the apartment. He may have done a bit more than just to rip me off. He could have even used my credit card or something like that to pay himself stuff because he had no hesitation to look through my things.

Unfortunately I couldn't resist and I confronted him about the way he used my phone but through text message. At first he was defensive but when I told him I have proof he didn't respond back.

16920,Non-Romantic,39wixv,"Background: My family and I moved the the United States when I was very young, so for the most part, I would like to think that I'm more American, to the dismay of all our traditionalist Asian relatives. My mother is in her mid 60s. My father is in his 80s.  For their age, I guess they're in good health with only minor things from dad.  I know they try their best and have good intentions, but sometimes, good intentions doesn't stop your mother from not understanding more non-traditionally Asian norms or when they don't listen to your point of view, you know?  In turn, I've kept a lot of my personal life away from my parents to stop arguments.  I'll be the first to say I don't think it's right and I don't like it.  For example, I was deathly afraid of my parents disowning me for dating in college, so that was kept secret to this day, but that's a separate thread, I'm sure.

Issues at hand: I've typically lived together with my parents. They would constantly tell me how high rent is and how stupid it was for me to throw my money away to rent when I did move out - and this was me just dorming and paying the college.   Currently, we do live together and get along decent enough only because we never talk about anything.  But the older I get, the more I want to move away to mature more and be more responsible for myself.  Because of my parents age, I feel I'm forced to stay to take care of them - filial piety and all that jazz. I hear how my parents complain about how they resent taking care of their elderly parents before they passed away and I don't want to end up like that, both in the sense that I don't want to be a full time caregiver and to destroy the already non-existent relationship we have.  Their English is bad, and they both are not able to drive.  I work fulltime and then have another parttime job to increase my savings so as long as they tell me in advance, I'm able to work my schedule around whatever it is they need: doctors appointments, phone calls, general errands, etc.  And this is why I prioritize savings so much, I want to be able to afford some elderly care when the time comes if they are fully unable to take care of themselves.  However, in the back of my mind, I fantasize that this could be my down payment for a house or emergency funds for me to move away from them.

I have two immigrant relatives that recently moved into our house. One is maybe 50-60M and the other is 21M.  I was told it would be temporary but really, it's permanent.  Uncle, 50-60M does not know a word of English, though he's nice and hardworking.  Despite his likability, I've mentioned before they came that he should learn English, but no one seems to think he needs to, sigh, so I'm super frustrated.  Cousin, 21M is college student, doesn't know what he wants or his foreseeable plans are. I feel that other people are making the decisions and he just goes along with it, however, my mother reassures me that this is what they both want, in the sense that they want to be here because 50-60M wants to support 21M, who wants go get a degree here since US college credentials are better.  Let me add that he has taken 3 years of college in his home country, only needing one more year to graduate and his credentials do not transfer so he'll be considered a freshmen when/if he does apply for school here (I'm not sure if this makes sense to me, because in college I've met a load of international students who didn't have to start from the very bottom and then adding on the fact that he was so close to graduating already... who knows, it's ultimately not my decision, not that it stops me from being frustrated). 

I do not agree with this general decision as I feel that 50-60M is being ripped from everything he knows and thrown into a place where he doesn't really know anyone.  Not only that, but I know he will need help because of his lack of English and this frightens me because I don't want to add two more people to take care of.  21M baffles me because he doesn't make ANY decisions since he's arrived. My mother will be the one asking me to help him either find a job or apply for summer school, yet he doesn't know what he wants, so it frustrates the hell out of me when my mother gets mad for being unsupportive.  He just stays in his room all day unless someone says, hey, you're coming with us to go grocery shopping, or lunch, or dinner, whatever. So in all honesty, he's just going to stay in his room because everyone does everything to take care of him and there's no pressure to do anything. I was told he knows some English but have not heard him utter a single word.  Again, i could be wrong, as I do not know 50-60M or 21M at all. 

My questions here are:

1. What advice would you give to someone in my position about elderly care?  Parents currently at age 60/80 but no immediate action is needed. I want to plan ahead and have an idea of what I should do and I'm not sure what's considered reasonable, as one is a lot older than the other.

2. In a perfect world, I wouldn't have to take care or help anyone.  But I'm 25 and I'm tired and stressed all the time.  How do I get past this stress of feeling like I'm being forced into taking care of them when I don't really enjoy being around them? I realize while dorming that it's better to have a more distant relationship, it makes us friendlier and we don't feel like we're at each other's throats.

3. Am I being unreasonable in saying that 21M should be doing something productive during these months before he goes back to school?  Or do a lot of students stay home all the time (because this is news to me, but let me know!)?  Am I unreasonable for saying that he should do his own research and paperwork for fall school admissions? Everyone expects me to do all this for him because i graduated from this state school college system. it's really too frustrating to be called unsupportive when really, I just want everyone to do their own damn work!

4. What is a reasonable way to not abandon everyone as my parents would say and also to live my own life?  My current idea is to maybe get an apartment closer to where I work (as I currently have to commute around 30 minutes to an hour in order to get to my work) and I can limit my interaction with them to maybe the weekend.  I have been looking up apartments but then fear that they will suggest that we should move together for convenience sake.  I dread having to reject them because they will continue telling me I'm unsupportive.  I just want them to understand that I'm trying really hard to not go insane here from people pulling me left and right for help.  But to them, it's weird because Asian families live and stick together and being anything other than a yes man is just.... unsupportive.

Thank you for reading this mammoth novel.

26 F married and have a career that both demand a lot of my time.


My mom died several years back and its just my Dad [63 M] and my two little brothers [10 M] and [12 M].


One of my husbands main hold ups with marrying me back before we got married was my family. They are not productive or capable of many things on their own. To be fair my Dad did suddenly become a single parent and his debt went way up when my Mom died and he is struggling with health issues himself. However they require my help with bills and my time (about 1-2x a week).


The issue isn't with helping them out, I really have no problem helping, I am blessed with a great career and loving husband and we have so much its definitely fair of me to give back in some way to people that don't have much and who don't have all the love and support I do.


My issue is my parents never disciplined their kids. I grew up being able to do anything and everything I wanted. We were poor so that didn't mean buying things, just no rules at home about really anything. We had to clean the cat box and do dishes, that was it. No curfew, bedtime, anything. I luckily had my grandparents influence and got straight As and didn't find getting in trouble very fun so I was a success. Since I am the oldest, I guess my Dad assumed it would be ok with my brothers.


Wrong. They are in trouble at school every day some weeks. Both are very bright but the older one just got dropped from his advanced class for not turning in the work and is failing 4 out of 6 classes. The younger one disrespects everyone all the time. His teacher has to call my dad 4 out of 5 days and even while on the phone you can hear him disrespecting the teacher. I'm pretty much the only one that can get through to them but it takes a very long and patience-trying half hour or more every time I go over there to get them to sit down and listen to me.


Its getting to the point where my dads health issues are pretty bad (I also have to help with that) and he doesn't even have the strength to fight them. That is not an excuse, I am just saying I understand why he just gives in, I'm 26 and in my prime its exhausting dealing with them only a few times a week. I can't just haul off and smack the crap out of them or take away their stuff. I don't live there so I can only do so much.


My job just gave me a responsibility promotion (no raise yet just more work) and I am working 12 hour days most the week. I simply do not have it in me to go over there and fight with them after working with no lunch to have the time to go over there. My husband and I even spent our Sunday this past week over there trying to do a big report with the younger one who did 30 minutes of work and then refused to do anymore. We don't live close (an hour or so) so it was really upsetting. My dad refuses to discipline them. He threatens them with taking away the TV or grounding them but they never get anything done. I know how it is over there, I used to live it myself. My husband doesn't even want to go over there anymore because he has a hard time not disciplining the kids, which my Dad is adamantly against. They do not come to my house because they are so misbehaved my husband can't handle it.

I am making myself sick with guilt and anxiety because my Dad just had surgery and really needs me now but with my increase in hours and recovering from an accident at work myself with several doctors appt every week, I do not have it in me to go over there. Its an hour drive and means I get 6 hours of sleep maybe if Im lucky and its almost always fighting half the time. Then they expect dinner because my Dad just passes out from exhaustion and takes advantage of finally having someone else to help. Mentally, monetarily, and physically I am not able to keep this up if they keep getting more and more disrespectful.


I want to help but for my own health and my own sanity I feel I have to take a step back from them. I can't make my Dad parent them and I am not their parent. I feel so guilty all the time that my Mom died when the kids were so young and really try to make up for it but its getting to the point they have to start figuring it out on their own.

I'm working a really long day today again, this is my break, and all I want to do tonight is curl up and watch tv and read a book for an hour before bed but I feel so guilty that my dad is over there with the huge assignment due (the one I tried to do sunday) and recovering from surgery and I want to sit down and relax. But they aren't my kids, are driving me up the wall, he won't do anything to curb their insolence. Im drowning here in guilt.


What can I do? Is there any way I can help them not be so disrespectful and ungrateful without my Dad supporting those things when Im not there? How can I stop the guilt from eating away at me? Im just miserable and don't know how to handle this situation.

**tl;dr**: Just my dad and two little brothers, mom died. I live across town and have for 8 years. I have a demanding career and am married. I help out my family with a lot since my dad is sick and makes very little money (he is a degree holder though). My Dad will not discipline the kids ever and they are becoming increasingly hard to handle. With long work hours and accident recovery myself I can't deal with those kids anymore. I feel mass amounts of guilt and dont know what to do.","I'm [26 F] having a really hard time with my family [63 M], [10 M], [12 M].

About 2 weeks ago, my husband Simon* told me he was going to see an old friend from college who'd moved to Canada. He said he'd known his friend since he was 16. 
He said he'd be using up leave from work, be seeing him for a few weeks. Fine, I thought. Gotta let him have his social life too. I wished him a good holiday, asked him to let me know how he was getting on.

But it wasn't until I came home from work that day that the next-door neighbour, an elderly lady, Angie*, said she had some shocking news about my husband. She said that my husband said to her Don't tell wifey [husband's nickname for me] this, but the real reason for me going to Canada isn't to see a friend, and it's a bit more private. Keep it on the qt if ya know what I mean. Nudge nudge, wink wink..

After hearing that revelation, I decided to hire a PI (private investigator/gumshoe), and his revelation shocked me.
I thought, has my husband got another woman, or something else shocking?

The PI showed me his report and told me that over in Canada my husband's claiming benefits and apparently looking for work, and the private eye told me that there's no-one else involved, he just spends his time drinking in the local bars when not trying to get employment.

So there's no other woman... but why is he looking for employment in Canada?

Isn't this an odd use of leave, and why didn't he tell me he was interested in working in or moving to Canada?

How should I deal with this?? The private eye helped straighten things out a bit, but I'm still upset and stressed.

So I used to be best friends with my sister in law's younger sister, who is around the same age as I am. Honestly, at the time, I didn't allowed myself to think any bad thoughts about her, and when we had a falling out a few years ago, it was my moment of clarity and I was able to see through the brutal dark cloud that clearly surrounded my vision when it came to most matters involving her.

She was /awful/ to me. Left and right she would tell me I don't deserve a lot of the things I had (nice hair, my parents still being together, etc). She was extremely jealous of a lot my belongings and in general made me feel pretty shitty most of the time when she would come and visit in the summer (she lived a few hours away and during the winter months we would keep in contact via MSN or Skype). 

As I said before, we had a falling out. It was my fault, but it was extremely petty. Basically I yelled at her over something really ridiculous and it spiraled from there. I apologised profusely, multiple times but each time she blew me off, then finally told me we had apparently outgrown each other. A few months later she came crawling back but I had already decided that her cutting me out of her life was the best thing that could have possibly happened, and very politely told her that was right in the fact that was had grown out of each other.

Fast forward a few years, I've been pretty content with her being a few hours away, meaning I rarely had to see her. But then recently her mom kicked her out and she moved in with my sister and law and brother. 

My sister in law and I were fairly close before all this happened. We would go shopping together frequently, or they would come over and just hang around my house, etc. But now, every time we go shopping, her sister comes. Every. Time. And my distaste for her doesn't stop at old wounds. She's /extremely/ annoying and very hard to be around. She's that person that, when a joke is told and everyone laughs, feels the need to add to it and then it just isn't funny anymore. So even if I were able to put around history behind us, there's also that.

So, I just don't talk to her, and try my best to block her out whenever I'm around her. But, even that is causing a huge amount of drama in my family. My brother and sister in law are both convinced I am the problem, but I'm really not. Her sister has not made the effort to speak to me either. The only time she speaks to me is in front of either my brother or SIL, where she'll compliment me on something I'm wearing. That's it. And I know what's she doing. She's pulling the See, I tried to speak to her! card, which is nauseating to say the least, especially since my brother and SIL fall for it.  

It's gotten to the point where my brother has taken it upon himself to come over and speak to my mom about how she apparently isn't being a proper parent or some bullshit like that. 

In addition, my parents anniversary is coming up. We don't celebrate Christmas, but we've always had this little family tradition where we have dinner together and get each other gifts. This has been going on since before my brother and SIL were even married. It's always been our little family thing. So, no doubt both of them are expecting to include not only her sister, but also her brother who is also living with them at the moment, which I think is incredibly ridiculous. Neither of them are part of our family, so why should they be included? 

So pretty well on both sides I'm being told this is my fault, that I'm being obstinate, that I'm being a brat, etc. No one seems to understand that there is a REASON I decided not to rekindle our friendship. 

So, I honestly have no idea what to do about this entire situation and need some advice. It honestly seems like such a petty thing when I type it all out, but it's really causing a huge rift in my family. In fact, both of my brothers, SIL, her sister and brother, and a few of my cousins are going to Cuba, but I wasn't invited. So I'm feeling really shitty on top of this all because of that. 


TLDR: Used to be best friends with my sister in law's younger sister, who is now living with my brother and SIL. My refusal to speak to her and general distaste for her has created a huge amount of drama in my family, with much of the blame falling on my shoulders and I have no idea how to proceed with the matter and resolve it.

Back in High School, when I turned 18, he tried to kick me out of the house. It was basically the result of me arguing with him when he would talk about World of Warcraft, because I also played. Those were pretty much the only fights we had until he blew up on me one day and was claiming to be mad for things that happened in middle school. I assumed he was kicking me out and he assumed I was moving out. Around that time I received a call from my Grandmother who was crying on the phone asking me not to run away.

I was angry that I was portrayed as the antagonist.

And here we are again. I'm a college student working two part time jobs to trying to raise money for a car, since I lost mine in an accident back in September. My jobs aren't great, but that's because they're within walking distance. And I live with my father.

I'm posting this because of the fight I just had with him. Though I may have questioned my ability to address confrontation before, I feel as if I handled this well, but no conclusion was met.

I got in a fight with him regarding getting a ride to a class for one of my jobs, which is at a different store location. He works from home and I asked if I could get a ride to the class at 10am, he said he couldn't but if anything I would be dropped off around 7am at a coffee shop or someplace open and have to wait until the store opened.

When I asked if he could ask his employer to allow him to do this, he said no. I told him I could lose my job if I don't attend the class and he just asked me, is waiting really that bad? When I asked if I could borrow the car, he told me I couldn't, made a quip about how he was a responsible parent and needed it in the rare case my sister got sick and needed a ride home from school and maybe I would understand that when I grew up.

I made a statement that he doesn't make any allowances for me, he then began to pick at my choice of words, saying any? over and over. I then took the statement back and told him I was wrong, at which he mocked me and screamed I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong.

Some more insults and comments were flung at me until he decided to conclude with he can give me a ride at 7am and he doesn't see what the big deal is and that he did more taxing things when he was my age.

When I tried to address him about his behavior during the argument he proceeded with statements like, I'm not married to you, I don't have to listen to this. and You can't treat me like you treat your boyfriends. (I had also just gone through a bad break up with a guy we both identify as an asshole.) And when I quoted previous interactions in the same argument he told me that I sounded like his ex-wives.

I told him he made me upset, because he chose to mock me and hurt me when he didn't need to. He claimed I deserved to me mocked and then complained about how long the fight was taking every time I tried to address it and screamed at me What more do you want?

I don't know how to deal with this. I'm not sure when or if he will threaten to make me move out, as he threatened to not give me any rides or help me with anything anymore because of the fight. I don't have much money, the money I have is supposed to go towards a car.

I meet my Ex at a graduation party when I was 17. He was a 20 year old single father with an adorable 6 month old. I feel in love with their family immediately. I ended up quitting college so I could move in with them.  Then we decided we wanted another child. My son was born when I was 21. Three months after my son's birth with all my Ex's drinking and then cheating, I finally realized this wasn't the life I wanted or wanted for my son. I left with my son. And had to leave 'his' daughter as well, since she isn't mine. 

My son and I have adjusted very well to me being single. I went back to school. I got a great job and we left our home town four years ago for bigger and better things.

My ex ended up marrying one of the gals he cheated on me with. She was verbally and physically abusive to him and his daughter. My ex's drinking increased more over the years. His life wasn't all that great.

On Christmas Eve three years ago, my Ex sent away my son and (his) daughter before his visitation time was up with my son. He was fighting with his wife because she had moved out and wouldn't let him (ex) see their son for Christmas. 

I have read the text messages on his phone. It was clear he was telling her he was going to kill himself if he didn't get to see his third kid for Christmas. She just called him a coward and a POS father, etc.

He took his life just hours after his other children left.

Now his daughter has lived her entire life with her father. Her mother abandoned her when she was less than three months old. Like most little girls, she loves and adores her father and doesn't see his faults. 

My current problem is that his daughter kinda 'idol' worships their father. Talks about him often. My son wasn't as affected by his death as she was but when she talks about him he goes into a depression. (He is special needs and has emotional disorder, so can't always deal with things 'normally'. He sees the school counselor at least monthly and seeks her out when he is feeling down in between their normal times. I have discussed more counselling outside of school with his IEP team - but at this time 'we' feel in school is currently enough.)

I want to help her without hurting my son. I am worried a week together may be hard on everyone especially since we just passed the third anniversary of his death. We haven't spent this long together since before his death. 

**I can't ask her not to bring up their father. Is there a way to ask that she doesn't do it often, or only when I am around? Only when my son wants to talk about him, if he doesn't want to come to me?**

This will probably be long so I'll try to lay out a timeline and be as concise as possible.

August 2013- His ex takes pictures of us when we are out one night and posts them on her Facebook, without our knowledge. Had never met her at this point.

August - November 2013- She sends repeated threats of violence towards me and towards my then boyfriend. All are reported to the police as a non-emergency, but for documentation.

October 2013- Possible home invasion. We came home from a friend's birthday on a night there was a show near our house that we knew she'd attended. When we got home, there were muddy boot prints leading up to the front door through the yard. My husband is absolutely immaculate, so when we walked in and there were muddy footprints across the carpet, he was stunned and disgusted. There was mud on our bed, and one of his bathroom towels was missing as well as my car keys which were on the counter. She was the only person besides him, at the time, who had a key. All locks were changed the next morning. She vehemently denied it when he brought it up to her a few weeks later. May or may not have been her, but the only things moved or missing were my keys and his bathroom towel, with no windows unlocked and no signs of forced entry.

November 2013- She came up behind us, dragged me off him by my hair, dumped a drink over his head and slashed his throat with her nails. We began the process of filing a restraining order. This is the event she repeatedly cites to her friends and the world that he attacked her, approached and hit her, and why her friends to this day say she holds a grudge and acts the way she does towards us.

After this incident, she started telling everyone we knew that he hit her, was abusive towards her, and that she was attacked by him for no reason. We did not tell anyone much about it for a few reasons- a friend of ours was there who whitnessed everything and knew the truth, we felt like the claims were so far removed from who he is as a man that no one would believe it, and we do not like airing personal business and had no intentions of starting a blame game or making our friends feel like there were sides to be picked. Two weeks later, we were out and she showed up. She got in his face in front of everyone we know screaming Are you gonna hit me again, mother fucker? so we left.

December 2013- 20 day restraining order granted, but my husband was laughed out of court essentially since he was claiming abuse from a woman, and did not have a lawyer but she did. She cried about spending her kids Christmas money on a lawyer and missing her daughter's school Christmas party, so the judge determined that she had learned her lesson and would know to stay away from him. That day, she posted a picture on her Facebook of a fire she'd set to a Christmas stocking she had made for him.

2014 was fairly quiet. She consistently spread gossip about him, which most of the people we know have come to believe. One of my husband's friends who believed it at first but came to realize these things were lies told it to us this way- she was talking to anyone who would listen about how he hit and abused her. We stayed silent. People want to believe a good story, and our silence allowed them to believe it was true. We felt we were trying to take the high road by not airing dirty laundry, but in retrospect, we would have done things differently.

This past Saturday. she showed up at a concert we were at. As always, I avoided eye contact, stayed out of her way, and we kept to ourselves. At one point, I saw a friend across the room I hadn't seen more than a few times in the last 6 or 7 years so I went to say hi. I did not know that the ex and a friend of hers were standing behind him. The story as they put it, is that I was all up on the friend (who I had never met, and didn't know to be a friend of hers or I would have stayed away). I was standing next to my friend, next to a mosh pit, so it's entirely possible that people were bumping around but I didn't think about it because that just happens at shows.

The girl pushed me, I stepped back and turned towards the stage again. She pushed me harder, and the next thing I knew she was holding my arms while the ex dragged me to the ground by my hair. I'm not sure what happened after that, as they threw my purse and my glasses behind the bar, but eventually the ex's new fiance helped me off the ground and I collected my things and left.

Now, after a very hateful phone call from the friend who I suppose I have now actually met, it was relayed to us that the ex and her fiance want to meet with my husband and me to talk things out. The ex called my husband at work this morning to try to talk about things, which I feel is completely inappropriate.

tl;dr;dr: I am angry, I have no respect for her, and I feel like she is trying to save face because for the first time, throughout everything she has done to us, this was very public and her friends are starting to tell her she was wrong to do that to me. I don't want her to be able to say Well we tried to talk it out and they wouldn't! but I feel so angry and I have so much resentment that I do not know what to do.

edit: We filed a police report yesterday, but since it was the day after the incident, we were at a club, and everyone was drinking (despite not being drunk), we were written off by the police. When her friend called to tell us they wanted to meet, we did tell her that we filed another report and her response was Oh that's going to help. You know no one is going to want to be friends with you if you call the cops every time something happens, right? I do not care to be friends with people who think that way anyway, so that doesn't bother me, but the police told us that a restraining order would be hard to grant given the situation.

Edit 2: Spoke with my husband at more length about the phone call he received this morning. Her spin was that she was sorry things are so fucked up and she is concerned for me because now straigh has a problem with [her friend.] It worries me that such a hateful, violent person is now supposedly concerned for my safety. I know nothing of that woman except her approximate age, and name. I wouldn't even recognize her if I saw her.","My [24F] husband's ex [late 30s F] attacked me again; wants to meet about it, but I'm conflicted.",0.0,False,251.0,176.0,1425914242.0,/r/relationships/comments/2yg58h/my_24f_husbands_ex_late_30s_f_attacked_me_again/,NonRomantic

ok - a few months ago a new younger colleague joined my company. I think he is a great person and we got along really well, so I decided to ask him out. I did this discretely on a Friday by handing him a note with my number, as I knew he would be taken by surprise and did not want to put him on the spot.

I kind of knew he was not seeing me this way but it is so rare for me to meet people that I like that I decided to go for it so as to not regret not making a move later. I thought our office relationship was good enough so that things would not be weird in the office in case he would not take up my offer. 

He said sorry he was dating someone casually (which I think was a way to not hurt my feelings but fair enough).

I am perfectly fine with that, but when I came back to work the following Monday I had planned to play it cool and not change the way I interact with him, but he looked quite angry at me (although it was maybe my imagination!) and it made me feel very awkward.
I didn't expect that reaction for sure, as he is quite laid back.. but I can understand how I made him feel uncomfortable.

It has been a few weeks now, and the awkward feeling has not gone... I really did not want that, I think maybe he sees I am insecure around him now and it makes him feel uncomfortable - or he just does not care and I think too much :) 

So I am thinking of asking him for a quick chat, I just want to let him know that all is fine from my end, that I won't try anything silly again, and apologise if I made him angry. Is this a bad idea? Could it make things worst?

Have you ever felt angry at someone who asked you out? Or have you ignored someone you rejected to help them move on? (someone told me he could be doing that, I just have a hard time to believe it!)

So basically my best mate had unprotected sex at a party with another girl I know about 2 weeks ago. She has confessed that there is a chance that she could be pregnant. Now I'm not sure exactly how all of this works but she said she has to wait for the 3 weeks(??) to confirm the pregnancy and find out the father.  Should also add that she has also had sex with several other men recently. The two currently have no contact for a few reasons, and he has no idea that she could be pregnant. Should also say that she is still tossing up whether to have an abortion or not. I know that he is not in a position to be a father at all, and does not want a kid.

Now the problem is whether or not to tell my friend. At the moment only me and this girl are aware of the situation. Now if I was in my friends position I would want to know immediately, but he is in a pretty bad state mentally at the moment. He has serious anxiety issues and they have not been good recently. I am afraid that by telling him that he could be a father might push him over the edge. I'm not sure what I should do right now. Please give me advice on what I should do.

My mother was a cheerleader and a gymnast in high school and college. She was very athletic and loved being active outdoors and doing things like horseback riding. She was never a small girl, but she was always very fit and healthy. She gained a little bit of weight after she had me, but was still a healthy size, but when she got pregnant with my brother, she gained a lot more weight and for some reason never shed any of it after he was born.

Since then (it's been 16 years since he was born), she never lost the weight and has gotten bigger. It's hard to tell because I see her so much, but I think she has been about the same weight for at least a good 5 years or so. So at least she isn't still gaining weight. I have no way to guess how much she weighs, but she's definitely obese, perhaps morbidly obese. She eats healthy foods and normal portions, but she is not very active, which is probably why she doesn't lose any weight. 

It's not as though she is a lazy person. She's a single parent with two kids and a dog. She's a teacher and puts so much time and passion into her job. She also volunteers every weekend at my brother's youth orchestra and runs him around to music lessons and play practices (I'm in college now out of state, but she did the same for me when I was at home as well). I don't know how she does it all, and in a way I would almost feel bad asking her to exercise more, as if I think she's just sitting around all day with nothing but free time.

I'm concerned. She lost her father when she was in her 20's because he wasn't healthy and got heart disease. I wasn't even born when he died of a heart attack and I know how much it devastated her to lose him. I have thought about this more and more throughout the years without the courage to say anything and now that I'm in my 20's, I'm faced with the reality that I might have to lose her like she lost her father if she doesn't change. That realization is my push to finally say something to her about needing to lose weight, but I don't know how.

I've never sat down and had a conversation with her about it because I don't know how to say anything to her without sounding accusatory or critical. I love her very much and don't want to hurt her. She's tried every diet in the book, but I'm sure that exercise is what she needs and I want to talk to her about it. I would absolutely be willing to get into a routine with her (this summer when I'm home) even though I don't need to lose any weight (my doctor has actually asked me to gain a few pounds). How do I approach this topic in a way that will spark real change without hurting her and damaging our relationship? Has anyone had experience with this issue? How did it turn out?

16993,Non-Romantic,27vyt1,"A few months ago, my son started failing classes. Since school just got over, he failed two classes. This kid has gotten A's and B's up until a few months ago. 

Around this same time, he started hanging out with some girl from school. I don't know what kids call it these days, but she wears a lot of baggy clothing, pale make up and wears ICP shirts everytime I've seen her. I think my son is in love with her because he now ALWAYS paints his face before he goes out, with the exception of when he was going to school. He had about $500 saved up and I guess he went out and bought all these ICP shirts and hats. 

At first, I didn't know what ICP was, so i googled it. I found that there is a culture around this band and they call themselves juggalos. I found a lot of negative stuff about juggalos, so naturally I was concerned. Some even consider it a gang. 

I brought this up with my son and asked him if he was on drugs. This was about two weeks after he started dressing this way. he told me to mind my own business and slammed his bedroom door in my face. If i ever talked to my dad that way, I got smacked upside the head, but these days it's considered child abuse so I didn't do much at this point. 

I waited a few days and tried to talk to him about it again. This time, he told me that I was being dumb and that he wasn't doing drugs. I asked him who he was wearing facepaint. He told me that it was no different then me wearing KISS make up when I went to one of their concerts years ago. I told him that I was going to a concert, not going to the grocery store to buy a gallon of milk. 

The argument really didn't get anywhere and I decided to let it go. This was until we went out for our yearly mothers day dinner. We usually go to a decent restaurant and this year we decided to go to Macaroni Grill. Well my son decided he was going to wear his facepaint and ICP clothes to this dinner. I was pissed off and told him to go change. I told him that this wasn't a circus and we were celebrating his mother. He got very upset and yelled some profanity at me about how I am a horrible father. I don't know if I was in the wrong here, so let me know what you guys think. 

Because of this argument, we didn't go to dinner. I feel horrible about it for my wifes sake, and I did make it up to her the next day but that isn't relevent to the issue at hand. 

So up until last week, my son and I had little contact and when I would try to talk to him, he gave me the silent treatment. This last weekend I found something no father wishes they would ever find. Call me a bad father for snooping, but I did. He was out doing his thing with this girl and I wanted to see if he had any drugs in his room. I thought MAYBE I would find some pot. If I did, I would confiscate it and ground him for a few weeks. But what I found was a white powdery substance in a small ziploc bag. 

I knew exactly what this was. I had a cocaine problem before I met my wife so I knew what it looked like. To make sure I was headed in the right direction, I smelled the bag. It was def. cocaine. Obivously being a former addict, I didn't want to taste it to be 100% sure. I went and talked with my wife about it and she was shocked. We didn't know what to do.

Hours later, my son showed up with this girl. I called him out about what I found and he completely lost it and told me I had no right to go through his things. I realize I might be a horrible father for this but I would be even more horrible if he had died from an overdose. He didn't even deny it. After his yelling was finished, I asked the girl to leave and that this was a family matter. My son told me to Fuck off and took her to his room. My wife was crying and I was fuming. It took a lot not to slap him across the head but I maintained myself and didn't resort to that. 

What I did next is what I feel was the best thing I could do. I called the police on them. My wife is still very upset with me for this, but I didn't see another way to help him out short of physically forcing his girlfriend out and him to stay. The cops came, found that he had some pot. The girl was asked to leave and my son was told if he tried to leave, they (the cops) would take him to a youth detention center for a few days. 

Well since all of this, my son has been grounded and is not allowed to see this girl. It's easy for me to blame it all on the girl, but I am sure I failed somewhere for my son to act this way. 

Apparently he is talking to my wife and asked her about going to some fesitval juggalos and ICP has. I looked it up and it sounds like bad news. My wife said he could go without talking to me. 

I am at a loss at this point. While I want my son to experience life, he seems to be headed down a dangerous road and my wife is enabling it. I did talk to my wife about it, and all she can say is that this is our way of making up for calling the cops on him. 

Can someone who has had troubles youth give me some pointers here? If I am going about it the wrong way, I would appreciate your input. What would you guys do?

Okay. So, to give you guys some background. I've known my current roommate for going on 6 years. We were roommates freshman year and have been pretty close ever since. I care for her like I would a sister, so cutting ties is something I really don't want to do.
I guess this all started this past summer. One morning this past June, while at my parent's place (2 hours away from her) I get a text from her saying, Boyfriend beat me last night. I don't know what to do. I freak out, go to my mother crying to try and figure out how to handle this. I've never been around that kind of violence before, much less been around someone who was a victim of it. I decide to leave immediately to go to her and go from there.
I took pictures of her injuries and urged her to go to the police...she never did. But she ended up staying at my place in town (rent a house for school) for the majority of the summer and eventually moved into my spare bedroom.

I was kept pretty much in the dark when it came to the relationship between her and her ex. Over the course of the fall semester, she started staying at the house less and less, to the point of not being there at all. She paid rent, which I never understood because I was basically just a very expensive storage facility to her. I hardly had any communication with her at all, which brings us to the present...
Three weeks ago, she shows up without notice at the house with her abusive boyfriend, with a trailer in tow. I figured she was moving out, which saddened me but was understandable. But, as it turns out, they were moving in. Yes, THEY. As in, abusive boyfriend is now living under the same roof as me.

I wasn't approached by her beforehand to ask if this was okay with me. They have NEVER acknowledged that this was actually happening. It just happened.

Of course, I am far from okay with this. If my parents, who are supporting me financially, found out i have no doubt that they would call the cops immediately.

So, I approached her once about it the same week he moved in. Just to get an idea of what's going on. Apparently, he's falling on hard times financially, and has no where else to go. Like, his friends won't give him a place to crash and he can't move back home because of his job. So, it's either our house or the streets...or that's the impression I was given by her. I asked of he has a time line of how long he will be here for....and all she said was, he's waiting on some calls.
Two weeks of awkward interactions with him goes by. She's acting really weird around me, and just generally things in the house are uncomfortable. I don't want him here, and they both know that, but I'm getting radio silence on their end. She and I could literally be in the same room, and she would not say a word to me. I've asked her multiple times if I've done something and if she's mad, and all I get is an insincere, no.

Which brings us to this past Thursday. Apparently, they decided to a throw a party in my backyard, which i would've been fine with if they'd given me a heads up. I had no idea this was happening beforehand. So, I ended up talking to both of them about everything. I told him that I can't financially support him and he needs to give me a timeline on when he will be leaving ASAP. He was surprisingly understanding and civil about it. Cool.

She, on the other hand, was defensive. She said she didn't understand how I was supporting him when he's always working and hardly there etc etc. I told her that utilities are an issue and pointed out he's basically staying rent free. I also told her that since she's been paying rent and practically not living here, that she doesn't have anything to worry about. As far as I'm concerned, she's already paid her way. But not him. She will always have a home here with me, but he needs to find somewhere else to live. Especially since my parents would absolutely flip if they found out he was living with me. I also mention that I was frustrated with how she's dealing with letting me know about things before they happen, using the party as an example. She then said that he had nowhere else to go, and she goes where he goes because she loves him. Basically, she told me that I would be responsible for both of their homelessness if he can't stay here. I just told her that's his burden not hers and she will always have a place to stay if she so chooses.

All of this happened without raised voices. The whole conversation was pretty civil. But she has literally not said a word to me since then. Abusive boyfriend has said more to me this week than she has. This is just so frustrating. I have no idea what's going on in her head and I very much want to help her....but I couldn't care less about him, for obvious reasons. Plus, I have yet to hear when he will be leaving. I don't know what to do from here....

I just started university this week and met an awesome group of people. They’re all interesting and unique in their own special way and we have a great dynamic as a group especially since we’re evenly split – 3 guys and 3 girls. It’s early days to say we’ll remain good friends in the years to come but there’s a good chance we’ll be together a while if we can get past this current hurdle.


**The issue:**
The oldest member of the group we’ll call “Tony”, he is the person in question. From the day we met he hasn’t stopped staring at me. Then comes the touching. He keeps touching my arm, putting his hand on my lower back, patting my leg – that kind of thing. I haven’t said anything yet but it’s making me feel uncomfortable. The biggest issue is that he keeps pushing me to go out with him. 


It came up one day when we finished class and it was me and the 3 guys. We’re walking together and talking about going someplace to eat. It was getting late and the 2 guys turned down the offer and so Tony turns to me and with thinly veiled excitement says, ‘well it’s just you and me then’. I promptly replied that I wasn’t comfortable going out with just him because I didn’t know him well, and that I would be equally uncomfortable going out with any one of the other guys alone. He tried to argue with me that we could get to know each other, but I stuck by my decision and that was that…until the next day and the day after that. He keeps bringing it up under the guise of ‘got any plans for the weekend, everybody else is busy and it’s just us so why don’t we go out’, he keeps suggesting all these different restaurants we could try and I keep turning him down, standing by my ruse that I don’t know him well enough. 


We were talking about drinking and going out today, then Tony said something that really bothered me. He said, ‘*I’d love to get you drunk.’* That short statement alone just made me shudder. What that implies is he’d love to get me in a vulnerable state, he probably wants to have a go at seducing me while my judgement is impaired and possibly get lucky and take advantage of the situation. Maybe I’m reading too much into it but he said it directly to me, not as an additional comment to the discussion, like he turned to me, looked me in the eye and said it, dare I say suggestively. Again I laughed it off, I didn’t want to rock the boat with all 4 of us in it.


He’s also been trying to copy one of the guys who’s been flirting with me and it is just so out of place. Tony’s approach is very clumsy, forced, try-hard, and I hate to say it but, almost desperate. 


I don’t understand why he keeps trying when I think it’s obvious I’m not interested, I’ve turned him down for the “friendly dinner” about 5 times now, I’ve been flirting with one of the other guys and I’ve been pretty cold and a little hostile at times with him because I just don’t like the fact he’s trying to force himself on me and also trying to manipulate me into going out with him.


I thought maybe I could try and put him off me, just tell him how boring I am and that I’m terribly naïve and I’m a bit reserved, and basically I’d be no fun on a night out. From this he steered the conversation onto how he thought my attitude was very mature and that one day I would be a very responsible parent and caring mother to my children!! Who says that kind of thing to someone they’ve known a total of 4 days?! I quite honestly can’t imagine how he thought that would work as a compliment(?).


I’ve been contemplating going out with him this weekend just so I can have an honest conversation about this, tell him straight up that I’m not interested in him and that I would like to remain friends if possible. Issue comes when I think about how this will have possible repercussions on the group dynamic. I don’t want it to be awkward for everyone in the group because they’ll probably sense something’s up. I imagine he’ll brush it off, react like an adult and tell me it’s ok but secretly I feel he’ll become spiteful, a bruised ego is hard to live down and he doesn’t seem very good at hiding strong feelings, I’m  afraid things will get very unpleasant. 


What do I do? Wait for it all to blow over, hope he loses interest? Tell him now, so he can’t blame me for leading him on and risk messing up the group? It’s like the elephant in the room and I am one more awkward glance away from spewing fire and brimstone at him for his terrible ploy to try and screw me. I don’t buy any of that bullshit about ‘getting to know me’, it’s obvious he finds me physically attractive and the aggressive approach just screams ‘I want to get you in the sack ASAP.’

17033,Non-Romantic,3by83m,"I had a baby in March and my husband and I asked his parents to watch our other daughter while we were at the hospital. We had informed my mom of this in advance and, although she never said anything, I know she was somewhat offended that we didn't ask her. I told her I would appreciate her help more after the baby was born and my husband returned to work. I made it clear that I wanted time for my husband, daughter, and I to bond with the new baby alone and that I wouldn't really need much help while he was on paternity leave for two weeks, but would appreciate her help when he returned to work. My mom did not seem to understand this concept or at least never acknowledged it. She would just get really quiet when I brought it up.

When I went into labor, I sent a text to my immediate family members (mom, sister, etc.) to let them know. I said I would let them know when we were admitted to the hospital and when the baby was born. I asked that they not check in about my progress. I had a very hard labor with my first daughter and found people texting or calling to check in to be very distracting and felt pressured to hurry up. (When my first daughter was born, I had told my mom that I only wanted my husband at the hospital, but she showed up anyway. I wanted to be more clear this time that I wanted privacy.)

Anyway, when we called my mom after the baby was born, she was really awkward on the phone. We asked her to come visit the next morning (it was around 10:30 pm when we called), but she seemed put off by that--like the time we suggested didn't fit well with her schedule. Maybe she wanted to come right away? (I just wanted to sleep and rest b/c I just shoved an 8 pound baby out of my vagina without any meds.)

When my mom and other family members did arrive the next morning, we asked them to call from the waiting room and my husband would come greet them. I didn't want them coming straight to my hospital room b/c I didn't know if I would be in the middle of something. A lot happens the first morning... doctor's visit, pediatrician visit, nurse check ups, lactation consultant, birth certificate paperwork, not to mention breastfeeding and caring for a newborn and myself. 

We wanted our daughter to be the first to meet the new baby and have some time just the four of us. My in-laws happily brought our daughter to the hospital and waited in the waiting room for us to do this and then came back to my room to see the baby for about 15 minutes before my whole family arrived, then they went back to the waiting room to make room for my mom, sister, bil, and two nieces. My mom made several comments about wanting to spend time with our other daughter--even suggested that my mom take her to the park while my in-laws drive around and see the town. (wtf?) She offered to bring us breakfast the first morning we were home and when I said that we just wanted time alone at the beginning, she said, Okay, then I'll bring you dinner instead. 

When my family left, my mom ran into my in-laws in the waiting room. I didn't witness the conversation, but she basically confronted them about not sharing our daughter. My husband walked up in the middle of it. I was so annoyed with her by this point, I asked that she not return to the hospital later that day like she had planned. (She wanted to bring her boyfriend to see the baby, but never asked if that was okay with me. We didn't want many visitors. None of our friends were invited to come. We just wanted to rest and get home as soon as possible.)

I was angry and upset about this the rest of the day. Instead of enjoying my new baby, I was talking with my husband about how ridiculous my mother was acting. I feel like she stole the joy of that day.

A few days later, I called my sister and asked if she could help me deal with my mom. I said I was too busy with the new baby and too upset about it and would really appreciate it if my sister would try to talk to my mom and help her understand that her actions were out of line. Instead of agreeing to help, my sister accused me of being selfish in not letting them help with our daughter, that my text asking them not to check in was rude and hurtful, and that I didn't consider their feelings enough. I basically hung up on her and haven't talked to her since (3+ months).

I've talked with my mom since then and, although things are not hunky dory, we're okay. As far as my sister is concerned, we used to be pretty close. She lives about an hour away, but we both have daughters the same age and talk at least once a week. We've been close throughout our lives. I've never gone 3 months without talking to her. At this point, I'm hurt by the whole ordeal, but I'm additionally hurt by the fact that my sister hasn't once called to see how I'm doing after having a baby, hasn't showed any interest in the baby, hasn't asked to visit or even see a picture, and hasn't offered any help, which I really could have used after my husband returned to work. I realize I could call her first, but I'm hurt that she has reacted this way and I'm tired of always being the bigger person. I'm curious to know if she is completely going to give up on our relationship/friendship over this.

What should I do? Suck it up and call her or keep waiting?

17046,Non-Romantic,2yejoi,"Basically, I have no close friends and it's started to really bother me. My self esteem isn't so great and I think everyone doesn't like me, which stops me from talking to people and hanging out with them.

I have social anxiety which is a big reason for me not having a lot of friends, but most of my friends/acquaintances don't know this, and I am worried what they think of me. I am scared that people think I don't like them, that I am unfriendly and bitchy because I don't talk much.

I had a group of friends in high school, but I was always quiet and didn't talk much. I was close friends with some of the girls as well but something happened. I'm not sure what, I guess when school ended I didn't have the security of seeing them everyday, and now my social anxiety is too bad for me to think about starting a conversation with them. I still hang out with them sometimes, but it's usually when a big group hang out together that someone organises. And I am not that close with any of them anymore.

Most of the time I just hang out with my boyfriend, and sometimes his friends (who are also my friends). Most of the time I hang out with guys more than girls, and I wish I had a close girlfriends I could hang out with. Basically, I do have *friends* but no one I talk to on a regular basis, or hang out with. No one I would feel comfortable asking to hang out with on my own. The friends I do have are people I hang out with my boyfriend, and I would like to have friends that are my own you know? Like he has his close group of guy mates, I would like that for myself with some close female friends. 

Everybody I know has at least one close friend or best friend, and I don't. It makes me feel a little lonely sometimes. and it does affect my self esteem. I wonder if there is something wrong with me that I don't know about, or if I am actually a horrible person and no one has told me. I like to think I am a nice person, but how can I be sure?

I am worried about what people think of me, as I know a lot of people would think a girl who doesn't have any female friends and mainly hangs with her boyfriend is weird or unfriendly. I am trying hard to work on my anxiety, I try to start conversations with people but it's hard sometimes. I don't really know what to say to people.

I was just after some opinions, would you be put off by someone like me? Is it weird that I don't have any close/female friends? How do you go about making female friends?

tldr: I have no close friends/female friends and think it makes me look bad/unfriendly, and am wondering if it's really as weird as I think it is.

So, like the title says my sister has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. First, some backstory. I came home from college mid May 2013 and this happened a couple weeks after. I came home from being out with a friend and my parents flat out told my my sister (15 at the time) was in the hospital because she was having bad thoughts. I guess she had written something out about how she hated herself and it would just be better if she didn't wake up in the morning and posted it on Instagram. My aunt saw it and immediately called her and my sister broke down and told her everything, and then told my parents. My parents then scheduled an appointment with a therapist, but what my sister had said worried the therapist so much that she admitted her to the hospital right then and there. 

We ended up getting her two out two days later after our family session mostly because my mom didn't want her there. My sister seemed changed from the experience, telling us that some of the kids had cuts and scars up and down their arms and that scared her. She continued to have weekly meetings with a therapist and seemed to be doing ok. Well, now two years later she is the girl with scars and cuts up and down her arms and legs. This past school year she had to do a partial hospitalization program because she began to get bad again which made her miss about two weeks of school. She also had some sort of breakdown in class and I had to go pick her up from real school. 

I honestly believe that most of her depressed feelings come from her extremely negative body image. She has absolutely no self esteem and hates just about everything about herself. She is obese, and probably considered morbidly obese from a medical standpoint (she's about 5'3 and last I heard was 290lbs). That's the point that sets me over the edge.

She is extremely lazy. Whenever she isn't at work (part time) she is sitting around watching tv. There is a RARE occasion that I have seen her go on a walk when I'm home once a week. But that's it. My mom got her a membership to a local gym last summer and she went probably twice maximum. Now I know that this could be from the depression, but I just don't get it. If she doesn't like the way she looks why doesn't she do something about it? I workout a lot and try to stay fit and active and I want to help her, but as soon as you mention something about getting active or what she is eating she shuts down. My mom tries extremely hard to work with the plan the therapist and nutritionist have set up and tries to only buy foods from the list, but my sister still finds a way to just eat and eat. She'll go out and buy bags of cookies or chocolate and eat 1/3 of the bag in one sitting then hides it in her room until my mom finds out. My mom will say we're having dinner at 6:15, and I'll see her at the pantry at 5:45. As soon as I say something about how we're eating soon, she immediately gets defensive and will say something along the lines of don't tell me what to do or don't talk to me, will grab something, and storm off to her room. I hate saying this because she's my sister and I love her, but it disgusts me. It's getting to the point where I don't want to be around her because I know she is just slowly killing herself. 

We haven't had the best relationship, but I try to be a good sister. It is just extremely hard when you can't say anything right and have to walk on egg shells around her. My mom always tells me, please be nice, everything you say and do affects her. I feel as though I shouldn't have to alter my personality to fit my sisters needs. Yeah I'm going to try to not be a complete bitch to her, but I'm not going to enable her actions. She also uses her depression to get what she wants or gets things to go her way by pulling the I have depression card and that infuriates me. She will straight up interrupt me while I am talking and make everyone's artention go to her, and blatantly tells me that she wasn't listening to what I was saying. To me that just shows that she doesn't have any interest in me and only cares about herself and only sets me back in trying to understand what she is going through. It honestly makes me upset that she can do something that disrespectful and get my parents attention, where if I were to do it I would get reprimanded for it.

I guess I'm just looking for advice/help for how to possibly see things from her point of view in order to help her. It's difficult to try to figure out what she is thinking or what type of mood she is in from day to day, and it just always seems like I say the wrong thing. I really want to help, but she makes it extremely hard with her actions. Sorry for the long rant.

17068,Non-Romantic,2gwx7k,"My friend is the best kind of person you can find: caring, helpful, strong, smart, and hilarious. He was the popular nice-guy in university, b-ball captain. I've known him since we were 4, grew up together in NY, his mom and my mom are best friends.

His GF is clearly emotionally abusive, forcing him to abandon friends, dreams, and family. He cannot leave the house if she is not home. He cannot look at his cell until she has. He meets her on her lunch breaks every day (works 30 minutes from her work and lives an hour away from it, I don't even know how he does this). If she is on her lunch break at the restaurant at 9, and he is off work at 6, he will sit in the parking lot until she is on lunch because otherwise he would only have 30 minutes to relax at home before he'd have to drive right back to meet her. This isn't done out of affection, but fear. Because he has too or else. He was banned from Facebook when she saw a female profile on his homepage (could this even be avoided?). She made him give up his PC (luckily, guiltily, I inherited it...)

She will start a fight over nothing and then sit there quietly while he begs her to please tell him whats wrong. Nothing is wrong, she's just bored. He will break down begging and sweating, pleading for her to respond. Serious pleading, not exaggeration. Every single day. His conditioning is so bad that if she gets up to go to the washroom 
without announcing what she is doing (and who does that?), he has to go and check to make sure she isn't mad at him about something. He will wait outside of the washroom quietly until she is done. He doesn't even seem to be aware that his behavior is extremely strange. If I walked past him to go downstairs, he would not flinch at all or give any indication that he is being perfectly canine.

We don't invite him anywhere and it hurts his feelings, but if we invite him out he gets punished for a week or two for having the desire to socially interact. It's actually done in his best interest, and sadly he knows it too. Quote: ME: Gonna play some ball, wanna come?. HIM: Nah, I can't, GF works till midnight tonight. ?!?! Can't play basketball at noon today because his GF works until midnight? I don't push it.

I would love to talk to him about it and see how I can help, or just find out what can be done to get him some freedom, but I don't want to damage the relationship.

He will not leave, and discussing that would only force them to distance themselves from friends and family even further, away from outside influences. He has disowned friends in an instant over this before, and it's become obvious that expressing disapproval only strengthens the caustic relationship, enforcing that we are alone in this together attitude. Merging her into the group hasn't worked. She is reluctant and defensive, and dislikes any of our colleagues.

There has been many occasions where he's asked me to lie about what we did that day to avoid getting in shit when all we did was hang out at home and then go to a hardware store. He's asked me to buy cigars for him at the store because the girl at the counter was cute and he didn't want to be caught talking to her. The thing is, this man can be trusted 100%. No cheating, doesn't mess around. Loyal through and through.

I want to see about helping him recover some of himself and establish some relationship-confidence to be his own person. He is literally a cipher for her life. I just need help figuring out ways to break the cycle and give him the confidence to stick up for himself. I want to hang out like boys.

They are old-school hispanic folk who think therapy is only for people with severe mental issues and they NEVER resolve their problems EVER.  They just do their version of moving on.  
It seems that as of late, their issues have been escalating to the point that there have been some nasty back and forth comments publicly on facebook, which is now involving other family members taking sides and airing dirty, OLD laundry.  It's seriously pathetic.  
My stance is this: If they are happier, healthier people by separating, yes, it would hurt me, but in the end, I am supportive of that idea.

17111,Non-Romantic,2q5sj5,"Hi! So this is my first post on reddit, and please excuse me if this turns out a wall of text, or I do something wrong haha. Also a throwaway. Anyway, some background on my step father and I. He's practically my father, i've known him since i was 4, and he was around more than my biological father (who has since come back into the picture). He even adopted me at the age of 12/13ish. We've always gotten along very very well, maybe fighting three times. 

So maybe time for some background on him. He's a very affluent well known attorney in our town. He's very well liked and respected. He's been coaching youth sports for years, and loves it. I think he likes it so much because he likes how it makes him look to the community and it inflates his ego quite a bit. He's coached me since the first day I started playing, which was around 2nd grade. It was a family thing for all of us. And I love basketball to death. It's always been my favorite sport.

So High School rolls around and he decides to continue to coach me in a way. He ended up being the assistant coach to the head coach of the varsity basketball team. He did pretty much all the scouting but didn't really have any input on the team such as playing time, or what plays to use. My freshman year was terrible. The coach made us mostly do conditioning the entire year, we lost every single game, and it was a super frustrating experience. I decided for myself to not play my sophomore year. It was reliving. So the summer after my sophomore year, my mom basically begged me to play summer league. So I gave it a shot. All it did was make me realize how much I love the game.

So my junior year I played again. And it was the worse decision I could've made. I made varsity this time around, and now my step dad was my coach again! How cool! The head coach of varsity is super  competitive, strung along half the team saying if we worked harder, we would get playing time. But it became increasingly clear that he picked his five favorite players, and everyone else was treated like crap. four girls quit. girls who were not treated as unfairly as me. Not that that matters, but yeah.

 I attended every single practice on time, and ready to go. I wasn't allowed to miss practice by my parents, and the only practice i missed was when i had a kidney infection and was seriously too ill. I worked hard. I wasn't a bad player, at all. I've played and loved basketball my entire life. I think even in a way they were harsher on me because they always tried to send the message that just because i was coaches daughter, i didn't get special privileges. Long story short, it was the worst thing ever. I cried after almost every game because I hoped and thought i was going to play the entire game but only got put in for the last minute of the game. It was depressing. I felt like a failure and my self confidence seriously plummeted. I couldn't understand why i was being treated this way. After one particular game i was ripped apart because i didn't get to play, once again. I cried hysterically the entire ride home, something that suddenly was common place after a game now. I'm not a girl that cries easily. I tried to talk to my step dad about what i was doing wrong, why was i being treated this way. It was like hitting a brick wall. He became very defensive, and said he had no say in playing time. 

After I was the only player sat out for 4 games straight; My step dad finally seemed to understand my pain and opened up to me. He told me that at this point after the coach had been treating me so poorly, and how unjust it was seeing as i was a good player and didn't deserve this treatment. He told me he wasn't going to coach next year. I didn't ask him to do that, but it meant a lot to me that he would stand up for me like that.

So flash to this year. My senior year. I'm not playing because of how much the coach handles playing time and such. It destroyed my self esteem, self worth and really made me feel like a failure. I know maybe that sounds totally petty, but.. It's shitty putting your entire being into something and getting treated like shit in return. If i could play this year and have it be a positive thing, i would. I love basketball so much. I'm sad i can't play. Lo and behold i find out that my step father is coaching this year. He just had knee surgery a month ago at the beginning of the season, the first thing he does after spending two weeks recovering in bed? To the High School to be in the yearbook basketball photo.

I'm so utterly hurt by his actions. I feel betrayed. My step father isn't supporting me against someone who treated me like crap. He's siding with him instead of me after stating that he would support me. I feel embarrassed too, that everyone on that team, my peers, know how I was treated and how i felt. And here he is supporting that man in front of them and not his own daughter. He knows that it's hurting me, and our relationship. He won't talk about the games, practices or whatever but he's tramping around the house wearing his coaching shirts, and the warm up shirts from the team. Brand new ones too, not the old ones from last year. He's tense around me, and has been lashing out a lot. I don't like being around him much anymore lately because i just feel so.. hurt. I know that I sound ridiculous for feeling this way, but I'm really struggling to push my feelings away.

So I guess what i'm asking is, what should i say to him about this issue? my mom is pushing for us to have a family discussion over it because it's creating such a rift. Am i justified in feeling hurt by his actions? Part of me really doesn't feel like i am, and the other part does. Especially after he told me he wouldn't coach next year because of everything.

tl;dr- Head varsity coach treated me poorly, and hurt my feelings a lot. My step dad the assistant coach, told me he would not continue to coach after how the head coach treated me. Here he is coaching me and I'm unsure how to express my feelings to him, or if i am justified feeling this way.

17121,Non-Romantic,2frkj1,"I have been with my SO [22M] for 3 years now, in a long distance relationship. We are very in love, he has never treated me badly even if he was mad at me, and wants a future with me. I want to marry him and have kids with him down the road. He is very loving, thoughtful, and a good person all around. (I am super lucky)

My best friend has noted that since I have been with him, I seem so much happier and that she can tell I feel more strongly about my SO than I did in previous relationships. She likes him a lot and thinks he is perfect for me. She has also encouraged me to cheat on past boyfriends/girlfriends, which leads me to believe that her issue isn't personal with my current SO.

I have never cheated, or even considered it, but my best friend constantly puts me in situations that could lead that way if I were a different person. She will throw a small get together, and invite a handsome guy and tell him to flirt with me... and then she constantly says stuff like I have a condom if you need it and tries to get us to kiss or whatever... it is extremely frustrating. 

She herself... well, she is a serial cheater. I'm not sure if that is relevant. She dated a guy for 6 months and cheated on him with 7 different people. I try to tell her not to do this, but in the end, it's her life... We are kind of polar opposites with relationships, though. I am more a fan of monogamy for myself personally, which is another reason I think it's weird she is so pushy. 

Last weekend at a party, the same thing happened... invited hot guy, blah blah blah... by the time he showed up I was HAMMERED. I didn't know he was coming. I had never met him before. We were at my best friend's house with just a few of our close girlfriends and their boyfriends, which is why I felt comfortable drinking. She kept getting pushy like I described earlier. Then, I was so drunk that I laid down on the couch to crash. She told the guy to lay beside me and spoon me! He did, and I was so drunk I pushed him off the couch and told my friend she needs to STOP THIS SHIT. I felt so gross. She looked like I had just kicked a puppy when I told her that.

Sidenote... I am only giving one side of the situation here. In every other way, she is a very amazing friend. She has been there for me countless times, like when I was sleeping in the hospital lobby floor waiting on my dad to get out of cancer surgery, and she laid beside me. Then, when my dad passed away, she stayed there too, even though his body was in our living room. I know she doesn't seem like a good friend with the whole cheating thing, but this is literally the ONLY bad thing she does.

WHY in the world is this happening? Any advice?

17122,Non-Romantic,280vvj,"My name is Melissa, 28 years old. my wedding is July 26 and things are turning into a catastrophe!!


I will start with the bridesmaids... So my sister(MOH) and I planned a sort of destination bachelorette party.. us girls planned to go to Minneapolis and the guys would go to Kansas City. We live in Iowa, so the drive was about 5 hours each way. No big deal! The stay for the weekend in a huge rented house for us girls was $80 a person and then we planned to cook our own food and mainly relax. Not cheap, but not a giant expense either. So we invited all of my girls, KNOWING that not everyone would be able to come due to work and money. We also invited a few other girls that aren't a part of the party. The girls that said they could come were supposed to pay up front, because that's how the booking works.


So the day came and we left on a Friday. Two girls were supposed to come down Sat am..BUT, no shows. One said she was sick, the other said she was on her way and then when she was almost there had to turn around and couldn't make it for unknown reasons.. (She probably never left in the first place). Still, not a big deal if she couldn't come, but so sketchy. So I was left with just three other girls out of 7 and even though we had a blast, I was very disappointed that the others didn't come.


The same girl that had to turn around asked me a few months ago if she could throw me a bridal shower. I said of course and got her a guest list with addresses, but she hasn't sent out invites and the party is June 29th! I am NOT greedy, but I have family members asking me when my shower is and if no one is hosting they would like to. I'm really bad with confrontation so I feel bad saying something even though it's her fault! What do I do??!


Now for my FI's side... They planned the same trip to KC and got more guys to attend. However, his BEST friend growing up told him he would be coming, but when the day came he was nowhere to be found and didn't answer any calls or texts! I feel sooo bad for my hunny. Once again, he was not upset that he couldn't make it, but the fact that he flat out ignored him the entire weekend. Another good friend decided last minute he couldn't come because of work but was all over Facebook the whole weekend partying. And then to top it all off, his best man left all the guys downtown Kansas City with dead phones and no car in the middle of the night to go screw some random chick. They were lost and had to wait two hours and pay $80 for a cab back to the house!! They got back and left him there and drove home. Yes, the best man is single and he can do as he pleases, but FI is upset because he just wanted to share the experience with him and he doesn't think that a good friend would do that.. I am also very close with the best man and now my FI is talking about kicking him out (and the others) and it really bothers me. He thinks that the people standing next to us should be great friends no matter what and if they aren't, they don't deserve it. I'm a very forgiving person and just want this all to go away! And I certainly don't want to change up the party arrangements this late in the game! I just don't know what to do! Please give me some advice!! Thanks!

17144,Non-Romantic,3into0,"Alright so this is a bit of a story where I feel a bit conflicted to tell because I haven't been the victim or part of any of these situations but the people that have seemed to be affected by it are my friends (well, 2/3s of it anyway). Keep in mind, all of the people involved are international students, two of the victims are from Asian countries.


So, lets start with my 'friend' [20m], who we will call Juan, he is in this mutual 'environment' that I am (which I'll leave out the details to maintain as much privacy), so I do see him relatively often on campus or on the events that we attend. Initially we were friends, but I drifted apart from the group of friends we used to hang out with since I just didn't feel comfortable around them. 


Anyways, Michael is a really sweet guy who is really polite, quiet and sincere. Andrew was another of my very close friends who had a crush on me. Andrew and Michael were on the same dorm floor, Juan was on another dorm building. Basically, Andrew and Michael met Juan through me.

One day me and Andrew were going to work out and he kept telling me that he had to tell me something that I could not tell anybody. I told him to go ahead and he told me that he knew that Juan is gay. I was just confused and asked him why did he think that. He just told me that apparently Juan went into his room, and that he knew he was gay. He kept saying how Juan went into his room and didn't give me more information, I just found the situation weird and said that it wasn't really relevant if Juan was gay or not, and if a guy had come into his room it doesn't mean he is gay. Maybe he just wanted to hang out as friends. He insisted that he knew that he was gay, but didn't want to tell me why.


Anyways, a few weeks pass and things start to change. Andrew and I grow very distant, we were initially really close but he just starts to disappear and act really weird. I'd ask him to meet up with me or to see him and he just would be very vague and we would never meet up. 


One day I was meeting up with Michael and some friends and we just joke around about stuff. Michael starts telling a story in a light-hearted way about one time that Juan was in his floor and knocked on his door. Then he just barged in and closed the door behind him and started to inappropriately touch and grind on him. I'll keep the details short but it was very disturbing what happened, and nobody was laughing. He then said that it took him a lot of time to get over it, that the next day he talked with his university and ours and was planning on coming forth and getting him expelled but decided not to since he was our 'close' friend, and didn't want us to lose a friend. At this point I feel really upset, because he felt compelled to go forth with it because of us. I also start to recall that one conversation with Andrew, and things start to make more sense. Me and my friends encourage him to tell, that there still is time, but he claims that he doesn't want to open the wound. I respect that, but at the same time what made me really concerned was that it didn't seem to be an isolated case. I asked him about Andrew, and Michael tells me that Andrew completely changed, started to act violent and angry and eventually moved out of the dorms to another place (already having signed a one year lease). My guess was that Juan had also done something similar to Andrew, and that he felt embarrassed to tell and the most he could say was that Juan went into his room. 


I try to reach out to Andrew to ask him about it but once again he was very vague and there was no way I could get him to meet me. I just desist about pressuring them since none of them really wanted to speak up. I was just really worried for it to happen again, the implication it has on our mutual 'environment' and the mental scarrs Juan is leaving to students who come to the United States for the purpose of studying. Instead of telling any teachers or superiors (I considered it initially but didn't go through with it for specific reasons), I did the next most heroic thing I could do and just badmouthed Juan (really joking on the heroic part, but when asked why I was not close with him I would just say that I had a negative experience on how he treated my friend, hinting at something sexual). 


Anyways, it is a lot of months later after the series of events, and the other day I met Juan for the first time in a long while. I didn't know he was going to be there, neither did he know I was there, but it just sort of happened. He ignored me completely initially (even though there were 4 of us only) and just looked uncomfortable. I figured that somehow the word got back to him. We start talking about the most embarrassing things that happen to us, and he tells a story of how he was in a party and he gave a drunk straight guy a handjob in the bathroom. He was saying how he was nervous since it could be considered as sexual assault, and I asked if he was drunk and he said he was tipsy but conscious of what he was doing. My friend said that it was alright if that guy had accepted it but I said how if the guy was drunk then he couldn't give consent (although it was a bit of a blurry line since I dunno what happens when both of the people are under the influence of alcohol). Keep in mind that this was the first time that I heard from him say that he was gay, and I had never talked to him about the incident with my friends. He also said how he liked really silent and quiet guys (which match up with both Andrews and Michael's personality and culture). So this 'confession' just confirms my suspicions since his behaviour just matches to the other events. 


I don't really know how to deal with this, I am really really angry because it has been so long and he has admittedly continued with this behaviour which was my biggest fear. I don't think I can report it to any authority without getting my friends involved (who are both out of the country right now, one not coming back). Any suggestion is more than welcomed.



**TL;DR;** : 'Friend' had sexually assaulted one of my close friends possibly two, gave a handjob to a drunk straight guy. Have no idea what to do and feel that it will continue to happen.

My parents are immigrants, they took all their siblings to the new country, one of them never managed to find a partner and so she stayed with my parents, thats my aunt.
She was helpful in the beginning, but never really managed to be a part ot the inner family. She is very sensitive, so once when my dad mentioned again that she should move out (mind you she doesnt pay rent in an expensive city) she just stopped talking to him altogether. When we're having meals together she will not be in the same room as him, ever, she only eats once he leaves. My older siblings already moved out years ago, i have a twin sister and my parents got us quite late. We still live at home, because the university is close to where we live. 
Now my dad gave up long time ago to find a solution for my aunt. My mother is the one who usually takes all the punches for my aunt, she takes care of her papers etc. and everyone kind of thinks that my mom is in charge of my aunt. But since my aunt behaves like a child it gets really tiresome for my mom. My mom is about to get retired and I want her to be happy and not to worry all the time about her sister. My twin sister is fed up and really just wants to kick her out. Everyone else lost the patience with my aunt, so here I am, I need advice, how should I go about this. I also would like her to move out, but I want it to be in a way that she won't detoriate or even hurt herself (i do not know wether she is suicidal, but again she is very illogical so i think this is the next possible step). She can't take care of things by herself, I think she is afraid of the outside world, like a child who is used to hide behind his mother. She doesn't have any friends, we are the only people she has, which makes everything only worse, she can't talk to an objective person. I'm afraid that if she ever leaves, it will create a huge mess for the family relationship.

I don't know how to solve this situation
She is a nice lady, but she is insane. She recently got diagnosed with depression, the doctor prescribed her pills but she is not taking them.

I'd like to say thanks to everyone who gave me advice in the last thread. It was really nothing I didn't already know, but it gave me the kick in the pants I needed to make shit happen. To the several people who felt the need to call me and my roommates retarded, the situation WAS pretty dumb, but we started out just trying to help a friend in need, and it spiraled out of control, and I think anyone could end up in that situation.

Anyways, I sat my boyfriend down and had a come to Jesus moment. The Reader's Digest version was, I am no longer interested in helping Guest until he gets back on his feet, especially because that is not what he asked for when he moved in. We have helped him for too long and he has repaid us with apathy towards finding a job and aggression towards Roommate. It disturbs me that you do not share my concern that he pulled a knife in our house.

My boyfriend was pretty silent after I laid it out. I asked if he had anything to add, and he said, I've been running out of ways to defend him, and I'm not sure I want to anymore. On the same page, awesome. We decided not to include Roommate in our decision, first because he totally fucked up our last attempt in several ways, and also because he isn't on the lease/hasn't paid us back for first-last-security, so we're the only ones legally on the hook here.

Due to our work schedules, I'm usually home alone with Guest for an hour or so every afternoon, and yesterday (after he had gotten home from a few days of landscaping work, getting paid nil because he was paying his relative back for bail) I told him we needed him out. He hasn't accepted any of our personal concerns (i.e., space, lack of job, couch-potato status) so on the advice of several posters here as well as my mom, I just blamed the landlord. The landlord IS pretty picky about tenants, though, so it was barely a lie. Maybe it was cowardly, whatever, it worked.

Guest was very gracious (I expected some kind of tantrum), and was glad I gave him ~2 weeks notice, but promises to be out by Oct 1.

I met a friend about a year ago at work and we became extremely close. I never had a closer and better friend. She had been suffering from depression and other things and I was by her side for the entire thing. I mean, she got hit after hit for an entire year and to make a long story short, ended up making a suicide attempt. During the events leading up to it, I always offered to take her to the best hospitals possible even if the drive was far, leave my own family to take care of her but she refused and I guess was scared about it being her first hospitalization and all. In the end, I had to call 911 on her and she ended up being hospitalized at a really bad hospital where she ended up getting more traumatized and left more depressed than when she came in with additional medical problems because they didn't take care of her diabetes or blood pressure problems. She became very suspicious of me because she thought I would never call 911 on her but I just wanted her safe, but it took a while for her to realize it. She was very paranoid about me and it was very hurtful to see her react in this way especially because I just wanted what was best for her.  

Now, I'm stuck because she is in a very depressed state and wants me to be back to normal but I have not been able to be how I was with her before I'm not sure why. I don't see her differently but she continues to push me away because of her insecurities and fear of abandonment and I just don't know how to make her see that I want to be by her side but I just need time. I offered all my love, time, affection to her and just asked her to be patient with me. She was not able to tolerate me being different with her and so she decided tonight to cancel her phone and quit her job which is a very good job. I could not believe it and its like her to think of doing drastic things like this but I just dont even know how to process all this. I feel like I am in a fog with everything that has happened. I don't think anyone would be able to understand what I'm going through because I think i've made mistakes along the way of course but I just feel guilty and sad and kinda lost about what the heck happened? If anyone has gone through anything similar or has any insight, please feel free to reach out.

TL;DR: Best friend is pushing me away after dealing with some very difficult situations. Could use some advice/encouraging words on how to deal or cope with this.","Looking for help [26 F] with my depressed friend [45 F], just had a falling out looking for some advice/encouragement",0.0,False,2.0,5.0,1383146200.0,/r/relationships/comments/1pjk6p/looking_for_help_26_f_with_my_depressed_friend_45/,NonRomantic
17223,Non-Romantic,2qlkur,"A little background on me to start: I am physically male but suffer from gender dysphoria, in that I identify as female. However, I only identify as such in online interactions. In real life I am very anti-social and just generally uncomfortable around other people but still identify as male in these situations. This is essentially how it's been since I was in my early teens, and I've been too uncomfortable to share my gender issues with anyone I know in real life. Living with gender dysphoria has left me very depressed, but I've found it very comforting to act out my female persona online, typically in online video games (MMOGs in particular). I know it may be dishonest or weird, but I don't let any friendships grow to anything in real life. I'm not interested in dating people as someone who is physically male, so I don't want intimate relationships with anyone, I'm just content to have a few online friends who accept me for who I am.

So, going back 5 or so years (not sure exactly) I join a guild in the MMO I was playing at the time. In this guild I meet several cool people that I enjoy hanging out with, one of which is my aforementioned-best friend (we'll call him Sam). We become good friends, have good times, yadda yadda (note at this point he still assumes and believes me to be female). A few months later he pulls me aside and asks me, in private, what I think of online relationships. As someone with no interest in relationships, I don't have much opinion in the online sort, but tell him I believe they can work out or fail, same as any other kind. He then asks me if I would like to be his girlfriend. For the record, this wasn't an awkward time to ask me this, but I still had to decline, considering my condition. I let him down gently, no hard feelings, and we continue to be good friends just as before.

Fast-forward a bit, Sam gradually hooks up with this other girl (an actual one this time, but still not the one in the title) in our little group. I don't have a problem with this, as long as she isn't a bad person (gotta look out for my best friend, after all), and she isn't. Things go alright for a while, but then it gets tense between her and me. Later on we find out that she's jealous of how close of friends I am with Sam. Stuff happens, I try to work things out between us, but then one day in Mumble (voice chat program, but I use text messages so I don't have to speak) I break down and confess my entire gender situation and depression. Everyone understands, thankfully (it was a difficult thing for me to do), and things calm down for a while. Sadly, things still don't work out well between the two and he eventually breaks up with her. I mention this situation with his first girlfriend because their relationship (at least for the most part) turned sour because of me. I didn't want them to break up, as I've always hoped Sam would find someone he could be happy spending his life with. He's someone that particularly hates being alone and doesn't want to spend his life alone.

Nothing too noteworthy happens for a few years, but our little group splits up for one reason or another. I'm still good friends with Sam, same as ever, and a couple others. We've since hopped across games, not always playing the same thing, but still keeping in regular contact. Eventually Sam is back to playing the MMO we met in (but I'm not, just got bored of it), and in it he meets another girl (the one in the title, let's call her Susan). Later on I join them in-game just to hang out and such. I meet Susan. She's nice, good at the game, runs her own guild, seems alright. Susan becomes part of our little group of friends, learns of my gender stuff and is cool with it (she apparently knew someone in a similar situation). Sam and Susan hook up, and again it seems alright by me. Things seem A-OK, right?

Nope. By now, Sam and I have been close friends for several years. We keep no secrets from each other, we trust each other completely, just the best of buds. I still keep up the facade of being female online, that much never stopped. This is a pretty high point in my life, the depression is at a minimum, and I'm feeling good. But then, Susan starts to become distant and quiet. I later learn that she doesn't like that Sam and I make flirty jokes with each other and is beginning to think that I'm trying to steal him away from her... I think (honestly still don't know for sure to this day). This was just typical friend-jokes and -teasing that we'd done for a long time so we didn't think much of it until it became an issue with Susan. We were respectful though and toned it down, stopping with the flirty stuff.

It was never good enough though. From that day forth, Susan was convinced I was an enemy and only became more and more distant from me, frequently pressuring Sam to spend less time with me and more with her. I thought, Okay, this is a bit crappy, but I hoped maybe it was just a temporary thing and if I laid low for a while it'll work itself out. Sam and I still talked and still played the occasional game together, but we did significantly less than we used to. By this point, Susan and I never did anything together, except rarely when it was all three of us. And when we did, it was nothing but awkward and uncomfortable, with lots of forced enthusiasm. It wasn't looking good.

I tried my best to improve things, but I could never really make any headway. I don't know all of what happened between Sam and Susan during this time, but it seemed like even Sam was getting a little fed up with her. By this time, however, the two of them had met up in real life more than once and also shared plenty of sexy-times. The stubborn fool was so desperate to be with someone that he put up with way more restrictions than should be healthy, but he was also getting laid. What a dilemma. But even he had his limits and could take no more. Eventually he broke up with her, said she was suffocating him with her clingyness and didn't give him enough freedom. It was bittersweet for me.

It was a breath of fresh air, though. I didn't have to worry about treading so carefully around Sam when we used to be so open with each other. It was such a relief, he said.

But not even a week later I begin to notice some things. Little things, but I had a funny feeling. On a hunch, I go to check out his Facebook (I don't care much for social media, so I don't check it often). And what. Do. We. Have. Here. In a relationship with Susan again? No, they just broke up, right? And he never mentioned anything about this to me. Confused, I start up a conversation with him. Plainly I ask, Are you back with Susan? He's evasive about it, as if he was trying to fly this whole thing under the radar, but I persist and he admits he is.

I'm speechless. I lay into him about it, because... what the hell is he doing? Hooking back up with your ex after only a week? You said you were happy you left her. It's different now, he says, she's getting help for her personal issues. Apparently Susan had a troubled childhood. Made her distrustful of other women, or something. I was never too clear about this, but it seemed awfully convenient. But you know what? I'll bite. Maybe this really will help her and she'll be a better person for it. Anyone can change, right?

What a fool I was.

Things were moderately alright for a while (about half a year, we're now coming closer to present day), but it still felt just like it was before the breakup. Only this time, Sam was much more willing to please Susan. She still didn't like me being around her precious Sam, and now she wouldn't speak to me at all. Susan is as non-confrontational as they get, even more so than me. Sam was still desperate to keep her, so I had to take the initiative. On multiple occasions I got into private conversations with Susan in an effort to win her over and see that she doesn't have to worry about me. I was honest. I was kind. I actually thought I was making progress. Every time we talked she seemed to warm up to me. After a while, she even assured me that I wasn't the problem anymore, that it's just some personal issues she needed to work out. Great! I thought. Finally sounds like things are looking up.

Nope. Of course not. All lies. Just fancy words to placate me and get me off her back so that she doesn't need to use any actual effort to solve her problems. From then on, nothing got any better. I was at my wit's end, there was no getting through to her. I gave up. I decided I would have to settle with the occasional, short conversations with Sam (did I mention we didn't play games together anymore? If I didn't have other friends, I don't know what I'd do). Things only got worse and worse, but I held on because despite what few conversations we had, they were still happy. We still wanted to be friends.

And then comes December 24, 2014. Christmas Eve. This also happens to be Sam's birthday. I can't remember people's birthdays for the life of me, not even my own family's. But that was okay, he knows my memory is bad. Sam texts me about it and I happily wish him a happy birthday. We chat for a good while, it's pleasant for the most part. But of course Susan is brought up. He says he knows things aren't great but he badly doesn't want to lose me as a friend, but doesn't want to lose her either. He loves her more than anything. I've long since given up trying to argue, but I tell him how awkward this situation is for me to be in. He understands. Our conversation winds down, his last text is Love you, to which I reply with a &lt;3.

A few hours later, I get a text from him, saying something about being drunk; not knowing what he's saying. I'm about to ask, what? when a huge wall of text appears. To summarize, he loves Susan more than everything and can't sacrifice his relationship anymore to maintain our friendship. Cue lots of pretty words to soften the blow. **Friendship Over**.

I feel like I was stabbed in the heart. Just like that it was over? After moments ago, telling me he doesn't want to lose me? I was angry, frustrated, emotional. I texted him back, said some hurtful things, but nothing too crazy. It was all honest, but I was just venting. What a great way to enjoy Christmas. He wouldn't respond to me, but guess who does? Susan. Spouts something about how I shouldn't make someone feel bad just because they made me feel bad. I was about ready to go full tilt. Who does she even think she is after this? But I kept my cool for the most part, refusing to let her have the upper hand here. Maybe I can get my friend back.

But we've been arguing over texts ever since, yes even as I type out this novel (I'm so sorry this turned out so long) we're still going at it. And yet it feels like a losing battle. She tries to convince me that I don't need him and that I should move on. Any question I ask that pertains to Sam (Why can't we be friends? Why do you hate me?) she dodges it. She refuses to give me any straight answer, and frequently tries to make me pity her (she tried to compare this to losing her mother). Not only that, but she keeps refusing to reply for long periods of time (is she ignoring me, hoping I'll give up?) and then when I persist, she claims that I'm harassing them and I should leave them alone. Sam won't provide any input, I'm just arguing with her, but it feels hopeless. I feel like she has such a tight stranglehold on him and there's no chance I can get him back. I'm just arguing with a brick wall. She doesn't want me to be friends with Sam and will *not* change her mind.

Again, I want Sam to be happy with someone, but is she the right one? Do I just give up the closest friend I've ever had and let her have him? I'm more depressed than I've ever been, but would I just be better off moving on? What do I do?

(Really sorry this is so long but I just had to get it all out. And sorry if this is in the wrong place, I'm new to posting on Reddit.)

**Edit** : To clarify, they've only been dating for a little under a year; half a year before the breakup, the other half after getting back together. He's been my friend for 5+ years, not dating for 5+years.

17233,Non-Romantic,1tcc8e,"So my dad has an older computer that he was going to let me have if I could get what he thought was a virus off of it. I couldn't get the wireless network card to work in safe mode with networking so I called my brother up to bring a copy of malwarebytes on his USB and he also brought me a new graphics card and a copy of windows 7 which is awesome.           
             
So my brother comes over and we attempt to just put win7 on and completely wipe the computer, ridding it of the virus. Unfortunately there were complications that hinted the motherboard was broken. So I tell my dad this, I tell him my brother will be bringing a new motherboard over and the PC should work just fine. My dad didn't like this idea much, mostly because my brother plays with computers as a hobby and not as a profession. He wants to take the computer to a repair shop AND buy me a new one. I would love to have a new computer and I know my dad isn't hard for cash but he's constantly talking about how the two of us (dad and me) need to save money for a car for me, so to go out and buy a $400 computer ontop of a $200+ bill to repair the old one seems so out of character for him. Especially because I trust my brother that he won't screw up the computer and can fix it for free, he's not asking me to pay for the parts. The worst case scenario is the new motherboard doesn't work and the computer is still unusable.             
           
So I was thinking that MAYBE I could get my brother to put the new motherboard in and tell my dad that the antivirus that we never tried worked as a last ditch effort. He wouldn't know that I put a new motherboard in because he doesn't know anything about computers and honestly I don't even know if he knows what a motherboard looks like. This could save him a LOT of money but the flip side is I'm breaking his trust and lying to him.

17238,Non-Romantic,3geupa,"When I left high school in 2009, I struggled to find a job due to my lack of experience. Therefore, when a parent of my brother's classmate (Mrs K) asked me to tutor her son (Liam) at maths, I leaped at the chance. It turned out that I was pretty good at explaining concepts to him because I used to struggle with maths in the past and, at the time, developed strategies on overcoming it. I think that, along with the fact that I was a young adult figure, that saw things his way made me more relateable.

Over the course of four and a half years, I taught him maths, provided some homework help with science. Of course, having been around Liam and his family for this long, I noticed a couple of things. 

1. His parents (Japanese mother, Chinese father) were strict with regards to academics but easy-going with everything else. It seemed that they talked about boundaries but never really enforced their rules.

2. He was an only child so all their attention was always focused on him. He was very sweet and listened to what I said.

3. He loved sport so he took up taekwondo and dance. He also enjoyed music so he took piano lessons. His schedule after school and on weekends was always pretty packed

4. In the fourth year, he discovered League of Legends and spent a lot of time on it, sometimes staying up very late just to play. His parents often pestered him to get off earlier but didn't have a method to enforce it.

Due to point #3 and #4, I felt Liam was prioritising study lower and lower. It reached a point where I felt my sessions were turning into a dynamic where I felt like I had to walk him through questions because he was too tired to focus rather than teach. I brought this up with Mrs K who told me, on behalf of both parents, that she understood and that they didn't want to pay for something he's less than enthusiastic for. 

Cut to two years later, I received a text message out of the blue from Mrs K. She seemed desperate for help for her son because, after she stopped lessons, he went from sometimes studying to not studying (virtually) at all. His attendance rate is currently under 20% and has not submitted a single assignment. At a recent meeting, she was informed by the school principal that he may be forced to drop out of high school unless he improves this semester. She told me that, ideally, she wants him to go to a counsellor but he is very resistant. She was hoping that, because I got through to him in the past, I might be able to again (and then talk him into seeing someone).

I asked my mum for advice and she told me that she bumped into Mrs K at work last year. Based on our discussion, it seems like he does want to finish high school, doesn't want to work yet but is also unsure about what he wants to do in the future. I also found out what his daily routine is like: wakes up at noon, goes to school until 3:15, hangs out with his dance troupe until early hours in the morning, plays LoL, goes to bed and repeat.

I'm definitely worried about Liam but I have no idea what he'll be like to interact with anymore. I don't know if he'll be able to learn to trust me again or, even, if he'll listen to me. I feel like this is way above my paygrade but I also think it's valuable for someone who isn't an adult-adult to listen to his problems.

Any advice on handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.

17243,Non-Romantic,37uy5u,"Ok so I've become close to a female co-worker of mine over the last 5 years of working with each other.  Last year, she confessed to me that she and her husband had been on the verge of divorce and she just wanted to talk.  Things cooled down and then the subject came up again a few weeks ago.

At this point, from what I've been able to gather, she is pretty much no longer in love with him and their marriage is essentially a business relationship about taking care of their kids.

Starting a few weeks ago, she's started to tap me on the arm more often and made sure to always say goodbye to me before she leaves for the day.  She's also told me that she really likes to talk to me about things because I tell her exactly how it is and I'm always honest with her.  She talks to me about things she wouldn't talk to her husband about.  She's been more touchy feely and once she nonchalantly brought up the fact that her husband has said that he's ok with her having an emotional affair since nobody would know and she could totally get away with it.  I was surprised and I hadn't really considered this until she brought it up.

I looked it up just to make sure I understood exactly what that meant and it almost seems like she could be.  I have to admit that she is the type of girl I would seek out when I would look for a relationship, but I'm also kind of confused whether or not I'm just thinking about it too much.  If the subject of us always comes up about us going to some event, just the two of us, she always says we couldn't because it would be awkward, but when she makes plans for a cook out one weekend we are both off, she asks me specifically if I would come right after she mentions it.  I'm a pretty socially awkward guy, so I suck at reading women.  Perhaps it's my own insecurities, but in my mind, it's almost like she wants to hang out with me, but only in large groups because I am really socially awkward.  I'm just worried that she says it would be awkward because she has feelings for me.

If she does have feelings for me, I'd be ecstatic, but I also don't want to be that guy that helps push her in the direction that leads her to ending her marriage.  Am I totally over thinking this or does it sound like she might be having an emotional affair and it may be helping her to leave her marriage?

As I am new to this position I am always working close with a more senior coworker as I learn the ropes and today I was on with a guy called Michael. While we were working we recieved a call from another department asking us to bring some files over. Usually one person is to stay at the support desk at all times, but Michael thought it would be best for the both of us to go. I told him I would be fine to man the desk on my own, but he said I should go with him. We went to the other department, dropped off the files, and returned within around 20 minutes.

Later that day while Michael and I were working, another coworker came in and said that our boss found out we both left the desk unattended earlier that day. After the coworker left, Michael told me that if our boss brings it up with me, I should lie to him and say that I was at the office the whole time, and that I popped out the back for a few moments, in case he saw no one there.*

I really don't feel comfortable lying to my boss about this. I should have been more stubborn and confident in saying no to going with him, I had a funny feeling at the time that we shouldn't be leaving the desk unattended. I guess because I'm still feel new I don't feel like I should stand up to senior staff members.  I realise Michael is just trying to save his own skin by telling me to lie to our boss. I feel like the best thing to do is to be honest to our boss, but I'm not sure what to say to him. 

Should I be upfront and tell him we left the desk unattended? How should I tell him? I don't want Michael to find out I basically threw him under the bus for this (it will make working together very awkward), but I also don't want to lie to our boss and ruin my rapport with him.

17268,Non-Romantic,20vp6f,"I'm reposting this with a new title with the hopes of getting it more attention and replies.  My apologies to the wonderful person who had replied to it in its original form.

Okay, so here's my long, frustrating story: This past weekend I was visiting my wonderful, saintly girlfriend (21F), lets call her Axelrod, of a little over a year. We are in a LDR, but not such a bad one; she is still in the college that I graduated from and it's only a 3 hour drive. I only get to see her about once every three weeks, though, when I can drive up for the weekend. As such, we both try to make the most out of the time we have together.
Axelrod isn't the problem in this situation. I was blessed by the relationship gods and I have found an amazing, smoking hot, unendingly reasonable, super communicative lady to pal around with. We have never even had a single fight. She does, however, have a roommate who is pretty much the opposite of her. This roommate, lets call her McNeil, looooves attention and causes a whole bunch of drama to get her sweet, sweet fix. The obvious next bit of information is that she has a bit of a drinking problem. It's not that McNeil is drunk every day, and it's not even that she doesn't know her limits, it's that she knows what her limits are and waves happily as she blows past them.


So to the actual story. I am in the supermarket with Axelrod, shopping for ingredients to make a cake for her teacher who lost his father over the weekend, because she is the world's biggest sweetheart. While we are browsing all of the cool butter and milk, I get a phone call from another friend, lets call her Murtaugh [22F]. Murtaugh tells me that I need to get home because McNeil was wrecked and barfed all over the floor. Apparently we were the only ones of McNeil's 3 roommates around for babysitting clean up duty. I should also add at this point that it is a Sunday night. Axelrod's got work to do and she has class really early.


So at this point, I'm pissed because it's my last night to spend with Axelrod and it was already kind of late and she had some work, so we already had a limited amount of time left before I left for another 3 weeks. Now we have to devote our very small amount of time left to cleaning up some stuff that came out of someone else's stomach. This wasn't the first time I've had to bail out and babysit one of Axelrod's trashed roommates, but this was probably the most frustrating because of all of the ensuing events.
Me and Axelrod wrapped up our shopping, and Axelrod is angry. She's angry because everything McNeil has done in the past two weeks has seemingly been specifically designed to get on Axelrod's nerves. It is not an easy thing to get my girlfriend riled up, but McNeil has a gift for it. Anyway, we get home and we just fucking do it. It's in the common area, smushed into the carpet and on one of the chairs. We use seltzer, but do not have carpet cleaner, so it's not perfect. At least you can't see it anymore. The entire time, McNeil is passed out in her room.


I get a call from Murtaugh checking if McNeil is okay, but simultaneously wishing that McNeil was dead. She is itching to tell the story, and so I get it shot right into my face. Murtaugh is normally a very sweet, kind person, but she is shaken up and stressed out. It's way worse than I thought:
So Murtaugh is at this party thing. It's hard to explain, it's not really a party, but there is alcohol there. She and her roommate were getting ready to leave, and they live in the same apartment complex as McNeil and Axelrod. McNeil spots them and asks if she can walk home with them, because it's already night time and the walk is like 10 minutes. They say fine, and at this point, they cannot tell that McNeil is drunk. As they're walking home, it becomes apparent that McNeil is plastered out of her mind. So now, Murtaugh and her roommate have to start supporting McNeil and help her walk. Murtaugh and her roommate just thought they were walking home with a friend, they had not signed up to carry a wasted person to her room. They manage to get to the apartment complex and they almost get to McNeil's room, when they pass the door to McNeil's neighbors' apartment.
These neighbors are horrible. Everyone hates them, they such gross assholes that its hard to believe that they are actually real. Needless to say, McNeil loves them. As they are passing the door, almost home, McNeil starts SCREAMING at them to stop. She demands that they go into the asshole room. Murtaugh and her roommate just want to go home and finish their homework, they don't want to have to deal with these gross monsters in addition to everything else. McNeil will not take no for an answer. She barges in on these guys, and because it's a Sunday night, they are all doing homework. She lays down on the floor and starts screaming and making an ass of herself. McNeil assures Murtaugh that they will only stay for 5 minutes. Murtaugh says fine, whatever and roughs it out for 5 minutes. When time is up she tells McNeil that it's time to go. McNeil starts shrieking NO! I WANT TO STAY! Murtaugh and her roommate have had enough and give their numbers to one of these assholes and tell him to text if there's a problem. They go home.


That is so not the end of this catastrophe. 20 minutes later, Murtaugh gets a text from this asshole saying that McNeil is a mess and she needs to get the fuck out of their place. Murtaugh goes back over to the asshole apartment and finds McNeil, on the ground, vomiting. The assholes are all around her, making fun of her, snapchatting her, and taking videos of her on their phone. Murtaugh and the assholes get McNeil back to her place and she continues barfing. Then Murtaugh gets McNeil to her room, puts her in bed, and peaces out.


Finally, back to mine and Axelrod's experience. This is the end, I promise. It takes us a good 30-45 minutes to clean up all of the puke. And our later, we're having fun couple time and McNeil comes into the common area, totally lucid and groggy. She starts mewling around for attention, talking about how drunk she was, how shitty she feels, all that good stuff. Then she whips this shit out: she says she wants to go next door and help them clean up the vomit and apologize. Axelrod and I sternly tell her that it is a horrible idea. She becomes suspicious that those assholes came over and said something to us about how much they hate her or something else dumb and paranoid. I explain to her that if it was my apartment and someone puked all over my shit, I would not want to see them for a couple of days. It seems that she reluctantly agrees and goes back to her room. Me and Axelrod get a little more alone time. McNeil comes back and starts up again with how guilty she feels and how she HAS to go over there and apologize. Fine. We've already said our piece, neither of us try to stop her.
The next day apparently McNeil called Murtaugh and yelled at her because word got out and Murtaugh was McNeil's prime suspect, even though those fucks from next door were actively snapchatting her in front of her face. It's totally fucked. This entire time, McNeil has not acknowledged mine, or Axelrod's puke cleaning; not a thank you or an apology.


Before I drive home, McNeil tells us that she has just been informed of a family emergency and she has to go home and won't be back for a while. So that's the end of that.


Here's what I'm looking for: Should we just drop it? Is there no justice for myself, Axelrod, or Murtaugh? I'm usually pretty good with McNeil, we're friends going back even from before me and Axelrod started dating and she and Axelrod are pretty close sometimes. I really appreciate that she takes Axelrod out and shows her a good time. However, watching the girl I love on her hands and knees, cleaning up someone else's puke without so much as a thank you has put a rage in me. McNeil was apparently so crippled with guilt that she had to go and apologize to the room full of people making fun of her, but apologizing to my girlfriend has not even crossed her fucking mind. Guh.


Another thing to note, and it may complicate things: McNeil has a history of banning guests. When they do something that gets on her nerves, even things as small as disagreeing with her in an argument, she freaks out and declares to the other roommates that said guest is banned. Obviously she has no right to do that, and if she tried to do that, Axelrod would have none of it. It would make her living situation significantly more stressful. She's so busy with a full schedule of extremely difficult classes and the work they entail, that the last thing I want to do is add more stress to her life.
That all being said, I cannot get over this image of Axelrod on her hands and knees, sadly scrubbing someone else's puke out of the carpet as we both watch our hopes of one last romantic night together circle the drain.

I've been friends with said girl for a couple of years now. We met in college, and, being older and more experienced in my field (we were both students at a fine arts school in the bay area) than she is, we've had what I've always thought was a really healthy, fun, and pretty intense friend/mentor relationship. We've spent quite a bit of time together. She's been dating the same person since before I met her (I'm not sure when they started, but it was before I'd met either of them), and I've been in a couple of relationships (I just broke off a major relationship with someone else a few weeks ago, actually) throughout the time we've known one another. Naturally, I never really considered anything romantic between us as a possibility and really never gave it the time of day.

A couple of days ago, we were hanging out and she drops a bombshell on me: turns out that she had developed intense romantic feelings towards be at some point in the past few months, and that she and her boyfriend nearly broke up over it. She swears she's worked through it with him and gotten over her feelings for me and that things are working better between the two of them.

My main concerns is that she still has romantic feelings for me and that it could cause problems, and that my continuing to be friends with her could create issues with her relationship and possibly future relationships. My gut tells me that she probably hasn't totally worked through her feelings, partly because I've been in a few similar situations in the past regarding infatuations with individuals where it's taken me time to work through my feelings, and sometimes those feelings can crop up later on in unexpected and sometimes troubling ways.

So, I put it to you, Reddit: How worried should I be? Is this a major issue with our friendship, or am I needlessly worrying over something that's over and done with?

Now, what really upset me is that she has SEVERAL posts about her suicidal thoughts and depression. I didn't browse all of them, but from a quick skim I can tell that she has hundreds of these types of posts, spread out inbetween a few years. Her posts from a few years before were better and happier, but I could find bits and pieces hinting at her depression. The more recent ones have been pretty dark and very blatant. She writes stuff about how she swears she will die with a smile on her face, and how she wants her life to be over. 

There are very few comments on her posts. In fact, in her suicidal posts I found that nobody has commented on them. I don't believe that no one has read them. Whenever she makes a blog post, she always shares it on facebook. I think it's very possible that people may message her privately instead of writing on her blog, but I'm also worried because what if these posts have just all been ignored?

I'm not close with this girl. I knew her from highschool because she was in some of my classes. I don't think I've ever even talked to her before.

17305,Non-Romantic,37wyb0,"My husband and I were married for 2 years, together for 5 years. We have a 3 year old. I have to provide some background information before I get into my question.

My husband is one of 10 children. His father was never really a father to any of his siblings except my husband. He's the youngest and for whatever reason he decided to step up and be a dad to him. My husband never had any issues with his father. They always had a good relationship.

I, on the other hand, have a different opinion of his dad that I've never made known to my husband. I don't think his dad is as great as a guy as he thinks he is. He's been in and out of jail his entire life, he sells weed, he steals, he's verbally abusive to anyone he meets (curses, calls them names), he's an alcoholic but the issue I have with that is that he drinks and drives regularly. I really don't have the patience or the sympathy for people who not only risk their lives but risk the lives of others. It seriously pisses me off.

Anyway, recently my husband has been going over there a little more frequently and has been asking to take our son with him. I'll go and bring him along but I definitely have an out of line fear when it comes to my son being there. I just don't know what his dad is going to be doing, who the hell is going to be over, and what's going on.

My husband mentioned a boys fishing trip where his dad would pick them up and spend a few hours out on the lake. While this sounds nice in theory, I don't trust it. His dad is the type of guy who will be drinking and smoking pot while driving, might rob the liquor store on the way out without ever saying a word he did it. I'm serious. I didn't say anything regarding his plans, but I know I'm going to have to because I don't want my son (or my husband but he's a big boy) driving around with him because he drinks.

How can I talk to him about this without saying I think your dad sucks? He's not a terrible person or anything, but I don't want my son in the car with him at all. I know if my husband found out how I really feel he would be really upset about it. And I get it. I'd be upset if my husband felt this way about one of my parents. I just don't know what to say to him.

We handled it like grown-ups, age considered, and maintained a amicable friendship - there was always something between us, but neither of us acted on it. He had other girlfriends, and I accepted that as I had no intention of rekindling the relationship.

The problem is my cousin, who I'm not actually very close with, though she'd like to think otherwise. Whenever I see her, she'll make a sarcastic remark about me taking my ex-boyfriend back.

I mean, it's not like they were *unexpected* in the beginning - I know it's not looked on favourably when you take an ex back. It's actually the first ever time I've done it, and it's only because the break-up was pretty smooth, we were still friendly, and there were still feelings - I couldn't see anything *against* it.

However, we've been together for almost 6 months now, so it's getting pretty damn old when she says, Ewww, who gets back with their ex?, Who takes an ex back? - always the same comments, but nothing I say stops her making these comments!

I've tried telling her to keep her nose out, f\*\*k off (slightly regretful because I was drunk), and I've asked her to just *leave it alone* because *we're absolutely perfect*.

17323,Non-Romantic,2n90lx,"Shortly, I've never gotten along with my younger sister. We fought like crazy when we were kids up until high school - no real reason, I always thought it was just sibling rivalry - but we grew up and I always assumed we'd grow out of it. I would love to have a nice relationship with her but she seems unwilling/hesitant and it's really hurtful (doesn't answer phone calls, doesn't call back, doesn't answer texts, doesn't initiate contact, etc). Mind you, there's no big event that has caused all of this. I've asked her before if there's something wrong or if I did something unforgivable but she's always said no. 

However, her unwillingness to be friends is really hurtful and I'd like to just stop trying. It feels horrible. On the off chance that she texts me (the only way we talk, happens a few times a year), it feels like I can never respond correctly. I feel like I'm trying way too hard and tend to obsess a little about what to write and I just don't like the whole dynamic. It doesn't at all feel good to me and the relationship - while I would love it to be closer - doesn't give anything to me. I've tried really hard to reach out and kill her with kindness (random presents, I saw this and thought you might like it, etc) and she usually doesn't even thank me.

17326,Non-Romantic,2tf37a,"Alright, guys. I’ve got a really terrible, involved situation on my hands that will require some back story, so here goes.

Full-disclosure: Names have been changed to protect the innocent. This is also how the situation has been explained to me, so there are some things that I don’t know about. Most of it is my own interpretation of the situation, though. And sorry about the wall of text in advance.

My mother (Let’s call her Mary) is the oldest of three sisters (let’s call the middle one Katie and the youngest one Lonnie). Their dad split when my mom was 12 or so, and her mother worked second-shift in order to support their children. So, while her mom was at work in the evenings, it was usually up to my mom to look after Katie and Lonnie. Mary grows up feeling responsible for the family as a whole.

Fast forward 40 years or so. My mother’s mother died in the early 90’s: stage 4 ovarian cancer. My mother is married with myself and two other sons. Lonnie has two daughters (let’s call one of which Tarah). Tarah is married with a husband and two children. Katie had a son (let’s call him Stephen) with a guy who skipped town. Stephen is married (let’s call her Candy) and has one son. Candy works as a nurse, overnight shift.

Around four or five years ago, Katie gets diagnosed with breast cancer. She goes through chemotherapy for about a year, and everything seems to be fine. Katie goes back to working the cash register at a grocery store (Let’s call it Schnuck’s). She starts having a lot of back pain. Mystery shopping from Schnucks HQ comes through the line, gives a fake ID. Back pain and long day results in Katie switching numbers when entering it into the cashier’s computer, letting the illegal transaction go through. Goes to the doctor, doctor takes some x-rays, says that the cancer is back and has spread to her spine. Gives her about two years to live. Manager at Schnuck’s calls her in, tells her about mystery shopper incident, fires her despite knowing about the cancer. She moves in with Stephen and his family. Katie has managed to live longer than initial projection but is presently wheelchair-bound and can’t even go to the bathroom by herself.

According to my mother, Lonnie grew up very angry, thinking the whole world was against her. I’m sure that their dad leaving is the main part of it. Anyway, she ended up marrying a guy with a similar world view. Whole family ends up with a chip on their collective shoulder, not to mention an anxiety disorder or two. Tarah definitely inherits this trait. Hardcore Republican, too. If Mitt Romney ever became President, I’m sure she would stop thinking for herself. True to form, she marries a guy with a similar world view, too.

Tarah has her first son (Let’s call him Janson). Tarah works all day, as does her husband, so they ask Mary to look after Janson during the day. Mary’s also looking after Katie, which starts out at once a week and gradually increases to daily (Candy looks after Katie as well, but overnight shifts cause her to sleep during the day most of the time). Mary’s daycare service grows into looking after Tarah’s second child and my brother’s daughter as well.

Enough exposition. Here’s where this shit hits the fan:

Tristen and Candy get pulled over by the cops. Cop smells weed, asks to search the car. Finds enough weed to slap them with a possession of drug paraphernalia ticket, not a huge deal. Also finds some pills on Candy that she’s not supposed to have, one of those ADD medications for focusing and energy or something like that (I’m not exactly sure which one). Enough to get slapped with a felony. She gets arrested and spends a few days in jail.

It’s Christmas time. Mary wants to get everyone together at Stephen’s house for Christmas because, let’s be real, it might be Katie’s last. Tarah vehemently refuses, stating that she does not want her children around drug-users like Tristen and Candy, who are now clearly dangerous criminals. Mary talks to her and tries to explain the situation, namely how it’s not really easy for Katie to get anywhere and there were much more serious crimes that Stephen and Candy could have committed. Tarah goes off the deep-end and screams all sorts of terrible things at Mary, exclaims that “she’s done with her,” refuses to answer my mother’s calls and text message, etc. Tarah then goes to Lonnie and her father, who assume that their daughter couldn’t possibly be in the wrong and ream into Mary themselves, which gets into some “Well, you could look after Katie too, Lonnie” comments. Actual Christmas comes around and everyone shows up, minus Tarah, her husband, and their now two children.

My mother is crushed. Not so much at being yelled at like that, but Mary’s become emotionally attached to Tarah’s children after looking after Janson 3-4 times a week for two and a half years. I’m sure Janson sees Mary and something of a grandmother, as well. And now Tarah’s cutting off contact with them in order to get I-don’t-know-what out of my mother. My mother has selflessly helped Tarah out, and this is the thanks that she gets for trying to get everyone together for what might be Katie’s last Christmas.

Katie doesn’t know about any of this, by the way.

I want to do something to help my mother. I’m also worried about Janson and his sister. I don’t want to see the trend of needless anger continue to run through and tear this family apart. It’s also clear that Tarah is using her children as some sort of weapon against my mother’s feeling, which is obviously not good parenting. But she’s always talking on Facebook about how great a parent she is and how she’ll do anything for her kids, blah blah blah. I don’t see how useful I can be, though. I live in Chicago, and everyone else in the story lives in a town about three hours away. I don’t have a car (when I do get the chance to go down there, I usually ride the train partway), so I make it down there I’d say about 4 or 5 times a year (the point is, I’m not very involved in the situation myself and don’t want to interject myself into something that I don’t have a right interjecting myself into).

Any advice you guys might have, I’ll really appreciate it. At any rate, I felt like explaining this to someone would be therapeutic enough, so thanks either way.

Basically, there's this guy I knew loosely for a long time when I was in high school who has popped in and out of my life for a couple years now. He's very nice, funny, etc. and in general just a cool guy who I'd like to be friends with. But I'm terrible with these things in the sense that I always trust (or at least want to) that when a guy says he just wants to be friends, he means it. 

-----------

I've been with my current boyfriend for 2 years and I would never do a thing to risk our relationship; I love the guy a ton and I think he's just overall so amazing. And so, I kept my distance from 26m because I knew he had a history of being a flirt. We happened to go to the same concert last year (we both like the band a bunch), and afterward, he texted me a bunch about how pretty I was and all that. I just stopped responding, wanted nothing to do with that, and he sent me tons of apologies the next morning. We didn't talk for a while.



One year later, the same band is playing, so I go with a group of girl friends and he and his friends are there. He invites us to hang and we all had a great time! Nothing weird, so I was pleased. They all left early and we stayed and had fun. Thought nothing else of it. He texted me this morning just joking about some things and then suggested that we hang out soon. I didn't know how to gauge that based off of that time a year ago, so I just didn't respond. He then texted me and said: 

 I'm not trying to pull any moves at all, I just think you are a friend that keeps showing up in life, so we might as well be friends.


That was a relief and made me pretty pleased! We went on to just chat; he told me about his girlfriend and I told him about my boyfriend. So we're both dating people and I think that's a good sign. Still, I feel suspicious, and I don't know why. I guess I don't know if it's possible to be friends with someone like this and I feel bad because all he did to make me uncertain was drunkenly text me and tell me I'm pretty a year ago. But can a girl and a guy be friends after that? Am I overthinking this? 

It's also that he's almost 7 years older than me, so there's that. 

----

Anyway, so that's really all there is to it, but I'm not sure how to go about this carefully or if I should just stop responding to him in case he does have other motives or something. I don't want to offend but I also place my relationship way, way over this potential friendship. I guess I'm just nervous that he doesn't mean it with the whole just friends thing. I don't know! I know girls and guys can be friends - two of my best friends are guys, love them dearly like brothers but they've also never given me a reason to be wary, whereas this guy's history just does for some reason.


Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you again!

We weren't exactly friends, but knew that the other wasn't batshit crazy so just went for it as neither of us had an alternative option at the time. She lied to me about where she wanted to live, so it took a while for her to actually accept any of the viewings that I set up, and after about a month of looking we finally signed a lease on a place. When we moved in, both RM &amp; I agree on house rules &amp; how the chores were split up.

Moving on to now and RM is not following those rules. She has guests over all the time, takes up more than her fair share of the common area, rarely does chores &amp; just generally doesn't respect the rules that we both agreed to. As I mentioned before, she has lied to me about random things, so I assume that she just lied when she agreed to rules, knowing she was just going to do what ever she wanted anyway. So I approached her about this, about 3 weeks ago, asked her to be more respectful, whether she disagreed with the rules, and in the end it came down to (with a lot of pushing for honesty from my side) I think we're incompatible room mates and one of us should move out. Most of the places around here ask for 1 year leases, and due to my work permit (I'm from outside of the country, which means I don't have family here either), I can't commit to anything longer than 6 months, so it only makes sense for me to stay where I am now.

I will look for a new room mate once I know when she is moving out.

Except I haven't seen any indication of this. As I mentioned before, RM &amp; I work at the same place, so we get home at the same time in the evenings, and I'm vaguely aware of her weekend plans. She clearly hasn't viewed any apartments in the 3 weeks since saying that she would start looking for a new place. How am I going to be able to get a new room mate when I don't know a ballpark of when she's going to leave? Now I'm even more worried because she's started bringing more furniture into our place. A new table, new chair, new TV, a game console... Most of which went into the communal space.

Would it be out of line for me to start pushing RM to look for a new place? Is 3 weeks too soon? I feel kinda guilty for pushing her to move when I'm the one that can't live with her and she doesn't seem to care what I do... But it's probably my patient attitude that has allowed her to walk all over me the last few months. What's the best way for me to deal with this and get to her to keep her word on moving?

I left for school this morning and left my speaker on my dresser. It's an incredible speaker, really small and has a great sound. My uncle got it for me when traveling abroad, so it can't be replaced.

However, she hasn't really gone through a long stretch of being single since high school, so I don't know if this is just a phase or is she's actually as serious as she seems.

I'm torn, because I want her to be happy, but I'd hate to see her get hurt. The age gap is a red flag, even though I am reserving judgment until I actually meet the guy. (Some of my family members have briefly met him and he seems nice, but the age difference raises a few questions...)

According to xkcd, the Standard Creepiness Rule states that the female should be no less than 1/2 the man's age, plus 7. My sister does not meet this qualification. This makes my mom especially uneasy, since she questions his motives.. (I don't even want to go there.)

Another little dynamic in this whole situation is that she will stay over at his house and tell my parents that she is staying at school. She's honest with me (that she's staying at his place) when she asks to borrow my car (we're both currently living back at home). Now, I wouldn't ever rat on her for doing that, because I was (probably) doing worse things in college and I could do whatever I wanted since I was away at school. I think she deserves her freedom, but my parents aren't dumb (maybe just in denial?), and I don't want to see her get hurt.

Has anyone ever encountered a situation like this, either personally or with a family member or friend? I talked with my mom today, and she wasn't sure if she should formally tell my sis how she feels (even though sis already has an idea about how mom feels) because this conversation would most likely make my sister pretty angry.

Should I continue offering her unwavering support, especially in light of the family not really consenting, or voice my concerns (opposed to my mom doing that part)? Should we just not do anything for a while and see if they stay together? I hope this gets easier upon meeting this guy...

He wanted to be able to talk to me, so he bought me a cell phone and pays the bill. I didn't have one before because I'm unemployed due to health problems and my mom can't afford one for me. Since he gave me the phone, the two of us have been calling once or twice a week to chat and such. 

Now things were mostly fine at first. He did make one comment early on in our catching up (he wanted a recent photo of me so I sent a couple and he said something along the lines of, Oh I have such a sexy daughter. Just kidding!) but for the most part he seemed like a normal dad. 

However, once Valentine's Day came around he began saying some things that made me feel uncomfortable. He sent me a text, Happy Valentine's Day! I love you my one and only. He also emailed and had a similar message. He sent two different Valentine's cards, one store bought and one he made. 


He frequently calls me Sweetie Baby girl etc. Now even through all of this I have been trying to tell myself these are normal dad-daughter things and I'm just overreacting. BUT then he suggested we go bathing suit shopping when I come home from university in a few weeks. This was the last straw for me and what made me post here.

17365,Non-Romantic,1sm8ai,"**tl;dr Older brother is on steroids. Not sure what to do because he might cut me off completely if I annoy him too much but I don't want him to die.**

Hi. I'm not sure if this belongs here but if anybody could give me advice I'd appreciate it because I'm not too sure where to go from here.


Firstly, I love my brother very much and don't want to do anything rash that could destroy my relationship with him, both because I do love him tremendously which is why I want to make sure he's not going to do anything stupid, but also because he pays for all my expenses/school etc. He's always treated me very well and taken care of me since I was a child - we lost our dad really early and were left with only our mum supporting us. However my brother ended up being really successful and now supports both my mum and me... I'm grateful because I think without him looking out for me I might've ended up on the wrong path in life.


My brother has always been really fit and athletic, but stopped playing sports in favor for gym when he was around 17-18 and started going to the gym quite obsessively. Since that age he's trained an hourish a day five days a week. He's got OCD and is very obsessive and anal about details, and has pretty much never missed a day since then! Even on his birthdays and Christmas he works out!! In fact the only days he takes off are when he's on vacation or for a week he'll take it easy and not do anything intense as it's pretty much the same thing as taking a week off.. which sounds ridiculous to me. He's also very obsessed with his diet, won't drink a drop of alcohol (including at weddings and birthdays) and uses protein shakes and creatine (which are basically precursors to steroids from what I know)


Every time I've tried to tell him I'm concerned he just laughs it off and doesn't take it seriously. He also always says things like somewhere out there, somebody who has less time than you is working harder than you at what they want to achieve, obsessed is a word the lazy use to describe the dedicated and that mediocrity disgusts me. Due to the fact that he's very successful in his career I get where he's coming from, and also due to the fact he supports me, and is kind of the 'crown jewel' of the family I've just let it drop. Don't get me wrong I'm super proud of him and what he's achieved but it feels like it's just too obsessive.


Well, recently I just got back from school for the christmas break, and I was bored so I was getting stuff of his hard drive to watch as he has lots of movies and stuff. I got thirsty and he has a mini fridge in his room and I went to get a drink from it and saw all these labelled vials and medications... which I got curious about why he needed so many medications so I googled it. Well it turns out they're all anabolic steroids!! I did abit of snooping around on his computer and it seems like he posts on quite alot of bodybuilding forums as well as steroid forums! THERE'S EVEN A SECTION ON REDDIT that he posts on (http://www.reddit.com/r/steroids) - is this even legal/should it be on here!? From his posts I've read it seems like he's only been doing it for around a year ... I didn't really notice but I should have as even though he's always been quite muscular and big he was slowly improving over the last 7-8 years whereas it seems this year he's changed quite drastically.


I got really worried about it and confronted him and he got extremely angry that I snooped through his room - which I'm not proud of but that's not even the issue here! I voiced my concerns with him and he told me to stop being so ignorant, that he's hit a pleateau in his training and his natural peak and this is the only way to improve. Also he told me that pretty much every professional athlete is on drugs so get over it and that it's none of my business. He said that he knows what hes doing and if I'm really that worried we can get blood tests and compare our results because he guarantees that he is healthier than I am. When I said that what about the fact it's illegal he said everything he has is in prescription and showed me the scripts. But he has a friend that's a doctor - which is probably prescribing him whatever he wants! 


I'm very upset and he's made it clear that he doesn't want to talk about it anymore and I'm not sure what to do. Everytime I bring it up he tells me that he's disappointed in me I tried talking to my mum about it but she will not listen to me, she loves my brother too much and thinks he can do no wrong. She said that if I should stop thinking I'm smarter than somebody who is supporting me especially if I still want his support.

They're just too selfish and lazy to put some effort into their decision to become parents. It's not like the pregnancy was unplanned anyways.

No, I'm pretty sure asking your parents to tear their eyes away from the TV for 2 minutes to talk to you isn't being a brat. And they go out to eat all the time without me because I'm too much of a bother to bring along even though I'm always polite and make a point of ordering one of the cheapest things on the menu when they do take me out with them, which is nearly never. 


I wanted to go to boarding school because I would have the same amount of support from them either way (meaning none) but at least I'd be able to see friends more but they were so clingy and wouldn't even let me apply to this one that was free because it's Catholic (I'm not even Catholic, that's how desperate I am to get away), wouldn't let me apply to any even though I'm pretty sure I'd qualify for quite a bit of aid because we're middle class and I have really good grades.

Thing is, I am in a relationship and I don't like the idea of sleeping in a room with another guy, whoever that guy is. I would hate it if my SO slept in a room with a different sex for whatever reason. It's a principle of mine to not do to others what I wouldn't like done to me. 
Another very important thing is the fact that I like my privacy and I want to have a comfortable stay at the hotel, which won't be the case if I stay with another guy or with too many people.

The problem is that I explained this to my colleagues ( I am referring to the two F) who insisted that we should stay together in the same room and really just gave me a rough time for not wanting to. They kept insisting, even though it made me feel uncomfortable and said that it doesn't make any sense to them that I don't want to.

There are seven of us based in different locations, and I'm the only person in my location who does my job. It's sales/order processing, and normally it's pretty good, but recently we've all seen a lot more work come in, and I'm starting to struggle.

Due to the locations of where we work, I've never had proper training. When it's quieter, my colleagues are great and will always help out with things I'm not sure about, but now that it's busier they don't have time to come back to me on things, and I'm often left trying to manage something I have no idea how to handle. Needless to say, things haven't been going great lately.

I've explained to my boss that I'm struggling a little with the workload, and that the number of things going wrong are down to lack of knowledge, not lack of effort on my part. She's offered to take some of my work from me, but ignored what I've said about helping out with other parts instead. I'm swamped at the moment, but I'm concerned that I'll end up with not much to do unless there's something else to take the place of the part I'm getting rid of.


I'm worried about looking lazy, but at the moment I look stupid and incompetent. I've had to take on more than I can handle, and despite my asking for help, I've been left to struggle. I know it's not intentional, but they haven't exactly tried to make this any easier for me. It has been so busy that most staff are having issues with things they haven't had time to sort, but fortunately theirs have only been with slightly smaller things. I've messed up a couple of fairly big things, purely because I couldn't get the information I needed and on a couple of occasions I had to wait for my colleagues to organise parts of it and they were so busy they didn't do it.

We are meant to be taking on a couple of new staff members in the future, which will help, but I'm worried how to handle things for the time being. My boss seems reluctant to hear that I'm not coping, and the impression I get from other colleagues' attitudes toward me is that they think I'm slow and not focused enough on the work. Asking to have some changes made to my role seems to have them thinking I'm lazy. I'm due to have a phone meeting with my boss tomorrow to speak with her about all of this.

I do love my job most of the time. I don't want to leave. How on earth do I handle making it clear that I need some of my workload to be moved around without looking bad? 

I'm constantly stressed and it's having a pretty bad impact on my home life. I also have a history of mental health issues, and my depression seems to be making its way back. I'm not exaggerating when I say that things need to change.

Work is stressful and I've more or less been set up to fail. How can I best handle this to come out the other side still looking like I am competent and like my job?

My eldest sister has always treated me like shit. She loved having the power to tell me what to do when I was younger and punishing me if I didn't listen. I've been verbally, emotionally, and although rare, physically abused by her. Any chance I took to defend myself resulted in my ass getting kicked because boys aren't supposed to hit girls according to my dad. This has gone on from the ages of 6 to 18 (when she finally got married and moved out). 


**Accident**

I haven't spoken to her in over a year because of a car accident my other sister [28] got into. It had been raining hard and I asked my other sister to pick me up from work one day. She agreed but on the way she got into a small accident. I can remember being worried for my sister and at the same time for myself because I knew what was coming. 

When I got home with the help of a coworker I saw that my eldest sister was sitting on the couch in the living room while my mother was in the kitchen. I asked my mother, How the accident happened? to which my eldest sister replied You caused it with the most cold tone and most hateful demeanour I've ever encountered. I honestly knew I would be blamed. Somehow, things always end up being my fault in my family's view. 

I became very upset and shouted at her, swearing at the top of my lungs and asking why she was always in my home. That was in November 2013.

My mother denies hearing my eldest sister make any such statement. Believing that I am completely in the wrong and my sister has always cared about, of course it's utter bull shit. 

**Present**

I don't know what to do. I just want to avoid her and live my life peacefully. I hate talking to my family, they're so close minded. Any I say or do is easily misconstrued as being the black sheep of the family. I just want to be left alone because I get angry just talking to them. My sister deserves hell but my family only sees her as their angel. 

What do I do? I want to talk to my parents and make them understand that I'm not wrong.

17429,Non-Romantic,28bydb,"Not sure what to do but I feel like avoiding her at this point. Am I being selfish? Whats the correct thing to do?

Short history: 
- we met and became bestfriends in high school when I was 15-17. We bonded over weed, having the same sense of humor, and being hyper teens. When I was 17 my mom left town and this bestfriend was very supportive through it all and had me at her house for dinner all the time because sometime I didn't have money to eat.


-17-23 - I relocate to Miami and we maintain our friendship. Hour long phone conversations at least once a week type thing. We would chate and talk shit and also help each other with heavier shit. 


-23-25 - I move back to the city I grew up in and she lives in. She seriously peaked in high school and is the most selfish, immature person I associate with. She never moved out of her mom's house except for a month or two when she was 18 to go to a college that she quickly got expelled from. She spent her time there doing acid and probably blow and heroin too from what shes hinted at. She shaved her head, fucked a ton of guys, and became a raging suicidal bitch.

I know depression is a serious issue as I have suffered from anxiety but my bestfriend will literally scream, rage, and cry while saying I'll just fucking kill myself! Whats the point? No one gives a shit about me. I tried to comfort her once but I soon realized she does this a lot. 


She is 24 and this behavior is only acceptable for maybe a 14 year old. She is also horrible company and a cloud of negativity. She can turn any situation into a negative one. She complains constantly and very intensely and angrily about petty shit someone in her family does.

For example her step dad: I fucking can't stand Eric. I just hate that he is always 20 minutes late. He's a fucking dumb pot head


My response: Well, your boyfriend is a dumb pot head

Her (screaming at this point as we walk down the street in my neighborhood): BUT STEPDAD DOESN't EVEN SMOKE!!!

I'm just thinking, bitch I invited you to froyo and you put me in a bad fucking mood just being yourself.

Lastly, I just learned that when she isn't enrolled in her full-time curriculum at school (which is completely paid for by her mom) she will do any drug that comes her way.

I just drink and I just graduated so I'm in the process of getting my career on track. She will reach out to people she hasn't had a nice relationship with since high school and she'll do any pill, blow, or weed that is in the rotation. Combined with her depression meds she turns into a bumbling retard. I don't even like bringing her out with my normal but less close friends because I usually end up baby sitting her in some way.

17438,Non-Romantic,1xvox3,"My roommate and best friend of 10 years has been involved with a guy [21M] for a little over 3 months now, and it has very quickly taken a turn for the worst. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before they were dating, but is not seeking treatment or on medication. I'm not sure if it's a direct result of being bipolar or an underlying issue, but he has severe anger issues. For example, he broke his hand punching a table when he was drunk and couldn't perform sexually. According to her, he has never (and will never) hurt her physically.

So here is the current situation:

He's very jealous and possessive. As a result, she lied about a friends-with-benefits type of relationship she had with a coworker before she and him were dating, but he caught her in the lie. I'm not defending her, what she did was wrong. However, I think his reaction was extreme.

He said she needed to earn his trust back, which is fair, but the way she has to do that is: be in constant communication with him (text him every second, answer all of his calls), send him pictures of where she is when she says she is at work/home, etc. 

She took a nap today without telling him, and he absolutely lost it on her. He yelled and screamed at her over the phone for a hour, then proceeded to tell her he cut his wrists because of her and was bleeding pretty badly (but not bad enough for this to constitute as a suicide attempt). He told her that he no longer had any desire to see a therapist because he was mad at her for lying. He then threatened to kill himself.

This is just an example of one night, but represents a pattern that has been ongoing for their entire relationship. I have been telling her this relationship is bad news since before they were even together, and am starting to sound like a broken record. But they are in love apparently, and tonight she finally admitted that if she leaves him, she's scared he'll kill himself.

So now I'm stuck. I want to be there and support her, but I can't support this relationship anymore. I don't know what to say or do. I don't know if I should get involved or just completely step back. I know this is a really messed up situation, but I can't make her do anything she does't want to do, which in this case is breaking up with him. She is my best friend and I don't want to lose here. How can I help her?

He's normal looking, no body mods or tattoos, he's even-tempered, and he hasn't done anything forward or weird other than glance at my boobs a couple times.

My ex and I broke up and she didn't approve of my new boyfriend and we had a huge argument about it (Long story short, my current SO is from our mutual circle of friends and it caused some upset for my ex understandably but my friend basically said I can't be friends with you now but when this all blows over I can, and that doesn't fly with me.

It was an immediate end to the friendship which ended really badly and we haven't spoken since. However, she still owes me what I consider alot of money. 


In my opinion, if I fell out with someone I would still pay them back. For example, I can't stand my ex, my blood boils at the thought of him but if I owed him money when we split up I'd set up installments or something because at the time I took that money on the grounds I would pay it back. Anything he does after that doesn't undo that promise.

17482,Non-Romantic,3gk821,"Growing up my parents got divorced when I was pretty young, about 5/6. My dad met my step mom Marie not long after that. Well they actually had dated before my mom and dad got married. Then my dad left her for my mom. That is the start of the problem right there, Marie already resented me because I was a reminder of my dad leaving her. 

Thing's didn't get too bad until I started middle school. My dad and Marie decided to move an hour away from where my mom lived. I was only with them every other weekend, but because of that it limited my social life. If I ever wanted to go to a dance, or football game, or anything like that they would not let me. That to me was really unfair at the time because they were the ones who decided to move, so why was I being punished? If I said I didn't want to go Marie would say I didn't love my dad so I sucked it up.

Another huge issue was my grades. If I got anything lower than a B I would be pulled into a room, and yelled at for 20+ minutes. I tend to crack my knuckled when I'm nervous and they would yell at me for that. Then if I cried they would say I'm over reacting. Eventually I hated going to their house. I became depressed, developed an eating disorder, and anxiety problems. 

By the time I was in highschool the thought of going there gave me full blown panic attacks. Yet I never went to the friend of the court to say I wanted my mom to have full custody. Because if I did that, then I must not love my dad. So I kept going until my Junior year. My mom had tried to kill herself, and I could not tell my dad. If he did he would have taken custody of me. So i refused to go over there for my own mental health at this point. Things got really bad after this. 

After that he would come to the house and drag me to his car when my mom wasn't home. One time he stopped on the edge of the highway and told me to get out because I was a terrible daughter. They went through my purse and found my birth control, and yelled at me for having sex. Even though at the time I took it for my PMDD.

I could go on and on about the crappy things they did in highschool. The icing on the cake is once I went to college though. I got a chronic condition called POTS. Before I was diagnosed I was in the hospital once a week, or at a doctors office. My step mom then convinced my dad to take me off the health insurance because I was obviously faking. So after that I cut off all contact until a few months ago. So about 2 years. My dad then came to visit saying he couldn't understand why I didn't want to be close with Marie, and why I didn't call him. 

How do I make them realize that just because they don't have any hard feelings doesn't mean I don't? Am I being childish by not forgiving them right away? Should I trust them? I hate not talking to my little sisters (I have 2) but I can't stand Marie. Even thinking about seeing her makes me nauseous.

17483,Non-Romantic,34ytl3,"Hi r/relationships, I hope you can give me some insight about how best to handle this situation...

First, a quick background: I met my friend Mike at a bar probably about 2 years ago now. At the beginning of our friendship he had a big crush on me - and likely still does, to a degree - but I was never interested in him like that and we have since transitioned into great friends. Mike is very intelligent (graduated with a math degree from an Ivy league school) and works a very impressive yet demanding 6-figure job in my city.

I'm his only real female friend, and I've gotten the impression that he is much more comfortable confiding in me about any secrets/issues than he is confiding with his group of male friends (I'm not very close with his guy friends, although I do know them all by name). I have been his sounding board while he dealt with many family issues: his abusive father, his downtrodden mother finally wanting a divorce, his drug-addicted and mentally unstable little sister... and he has handled all of these issues so well that it almost defies logic. He swears up and down that he is rarely bothered by the terrible things that go on at home, but I thought I'd include them to help paint an entire background of the situation at hand.

His sister, for example, is a heroin addict and started using in middle school. To make a long story short, she never graduated high school, constantly steals thousands of dollars from her parents, has been in and out of jail and rehab multiple times, has had 3 abortions, suffers from bipolar disorder and dermatillomania (OCD-spectrum disorder where the sufferer obsessively pulls out hair), and is now looking at a lengthy prison sentence after breaking parole. Mike actually thinks this is the best thing for her, as jail will force her to be clean. 

That is just one example of drug abuse and mental disorders in his family, and there are many others. He has always said I will never do something that causes physical addiction because he knows he has this genetic predisposition to it. That said, he DOES drink (not to excess, from what I can tell) and smokes pot very frequently. I think he is less than honest about how often he smokes, as recent conversations with his friends give the impression it's a daily occurrence. He says that pot is ok, as it doesn't cause physical addiction and he has easily quit before when he needed to be drug tested for interviews. He also occasionally uses another drug (I think ecstasy?) when he is forced out to clubs with friends because he is by nature a very shy/introverted person and I wouldn't be able to have fun without it. Again, he says he can quit any time.

Our current issue began a few months ago. I guess he was very stressed out by his responsibilities at work so he started taking adderall. The following is his account of what happened: Over the course of a few days, he took upwards of 300mg of the substance. He stopped sleeping and was having heart palpitations and some sort of nervous breakdown. He checked himself into the hospital twice over that weekend, convinced he was dying. This seems to have caused some sort of mental break in his brain, and he had to take a psychiatrist-prescribed month of leave off work to recover - he claimed to HR that it was because of his family issues, but in reality it was side effects from the adderall overdose, which include:

1. Extreme anxiety. I can't point to exact examples, as again this is all from his PoV.

2. Inability to concentrate at work, which of course doesn't help his anxiety at all.

3. Mood swings. This worries me with his sister being bipolar.

4. OCD-like symptoms. For example, he has obsessively manages this to-do list that is ruining his life. This list is full of things that don't need to be on a to-do list, like buy socks or brush teeth as well as things he knows he will never do or things from months ago. This list is like 4 fucking pages long and growing. He has sublists within the list. He stares at this list first thing in the morning when he wakes up, stares at it for hours at work, etc. Basically, he cannot escape this list. It fills him with INTENSE anxiety. When I suggested getting rid of the list, he said he couldn't do it... The thought of getting rid of the list almost caused a panic attack.

5. A song in his head that never stops playing. I think the song changes, but basically there is always at least one song playing at all times, like a radio that never turns off. He struggles to fall asleep because of it. 

6. Constant headaches/migraines

Before you suggest this, he HAS gone to a therapist. After the overdose his therapist prescribed him antidepressants (Idk which one, nor do I know if hes on any medications for other addictions) and wrote a note to get him the month off of work while he waited for the meds to start being effective. He is also receiving cognitive behavioral therapy to teach him how to deal with anxiety.

Now, here's where our issue begins: while this has been going on, we haven't been talking as much as we used to. This is my fault, I've been busy, and quite frankly he has been a lot to deal with (like one time he showed up outside my apt wasted after I told him I was busy and not to come over). I have been doing weekly/bi-weekly check ins and hang out with him maybe twice a month, and from what he has said to me, he is in the process of recovery. He is happy to be back at work because he now has something to focus on. His bosses didn't give him too much. He is never touching adderall again (he kept saying/laughing DRUGS ARE BAD!) and all things considered seems very optimistic. He says he is still having his issues listed above, but he seemed normal from what I could tell. 

However...

One of his guy friends sent me a Facebook friend request a few days ago. Once I accepted, he messaged me immediately and asked What (if anything) do you know about Mike since he returned to work? I'm trying to figure out if he is telling us everything. 

I wasn't going to answer - I knew he wasn't telling his guy friends all the stuff that has been going on due to embarrassment. For example, when he had his leave from work, his roommate asked him You would tell me if you got fired from your job.. right? As far as I knew, the guys knew very little about what he has been going through and I wasn't about to betray his trust until his friend followed up a few minutes later with: Bc he's been using again.

Me: Shit really? Last I spoke with him, he was doing better. He was happy that he returned to work since keeping busy was helpful and he was optimistic about everything. He said he was never going to do adderal again.

Him: Yeah exactly that's what he told us too. He was apparently full of shit. I had a chance encounter last night that blew everything open. I had dinner w my friend and 30 min into the convo he's like oh by the way Mike texted me asking if I knew where he could get adderall from

Mike later claimed that he started again for work purposes. He told someone else that he was mainly using it for running purposes. 

Moreover, when I showed his friend the texts Mike sent me saying how work was easy, his friend says well, this is awkward. He didn't go to work that day. Or the next day. Or the following day. Apparently he kept calling in sick, finally going into the office on Thursday when he told me all these stories about being back in the office on Monday.

Separately, his friends, growing worried about his erratic behavior, staged an intervention a few weeks ago. Apparently during the month he was supposed to be getting better, all he did was sleep 14 hours a day and smoke a lot of weed. His friend told me that he didn't leave the apt at all for a week. They confiscated all of his drugs (he had been getting high A LOT). After the intervention, Mike was very thankful that he had such good friends. Gladly handed over all of his drugs. His friend described him as manic and kind of annoying, actually, he kept wanting to do things. They thought he was finally getting his shit back together.

However, this past weekend he seemed high as fuck and his roommate found edibles in his room that he has been hiding from them. Combined with the text that Mike sent to his friend asking for more adderall, they are getting very worried. So am I. Mike has been flat out lying to all of us. He claims to not be doing any drugs, but he is. He claimed to be at work, but he wasn't. He is scaring me with his self-reported anxiety, mood swings, and obsessive compulsive tendencies (again, I haven't noticed any of those in person.. This is just what he's telling me, but then again he has been lying to me about other things so I don't know what to believe!)

His guy friends asked me to try to talk to him, as they think I have a better chance of getting the truth out of him. They asked me to try and not reveal the fact that I know he's lying to my face about his drug use/going to work, as that will prove that we have been talking about him behind his back (although they said I could confess as a last resort).

17496,Non-Romantic,2t02ij,"He deleted me on Facebook. Why?

Some background: he’s a foreign exchange student. We met in college. He began flirting with me, gave a lot of compliments, and consistently touched me by “accident”. Kept asking me about my future career plans and if I was up for getting married and possibly moving elsewhere and what my parents were like, asked me out to a café, etc He was cute but I wasn’t sure if he was playing me (since exchange students just want to have fun) because he seemed like the kind of guy who is friends with everyone especially with all the girls. His FB was full of party pics of him and random chicks. He was charming and he knew it. So I haven’t really responded in any way, kept it professional and was cautious. He asked to be in a group with me for a project and I said ok. 

He promised to work hard but as every exchange student he has spent all his time partying, his input to the project throughout the semester was minimal and he only began to do any actual work 3-4 days before the deadline. As a result his part of the project was weak. I began to get annoyed but was polite in our communication and completely stopped responding to his compliments which have switched from you are “pretty” to “smart”. I wasn’t sure anymore if he was using me to get a good grade and an easy project as I did most of it. Eventually we began fighting all the time, he would get offended whenever I would correct his spelling (his English was not very good) or make any remarks regarding his work and started criticizing my work (fair enough). 

On the last day we had a big fight about a ton of small things and we have missed the submission date but eventually managed to get the project submitted anyway. I told him that to me grades matter and he yelled that he didn’t need good grades because he wasn’t planning to work in some bank like me and that I was a naive idiot for thinking that grades matter at all. I guess the part that hurt was that he knew how important the project was to me but decided to be selfish anyway (since he had already secured a future job) and not try very hard. He would also raise voice on me while I tend to withdraw in situations like this.

 At the exam I decided to present an alternative version of his part. In the feedback the examiner told me that I have managed to get a better grade only due to disagreeing with the paper as it was crap. He went in after me and later FBed that he had gotten the same grade as me (which I seriously doubt) since he already knew mine. 

We kept a brief polite talk on FB about how the exam went and he had asked me about the internship I have gotten (which I knew he also wanted). So I replied and have sent him a few more links he had asked me for previously to end things on a good note. He is the type of guy who is always on FB but he didn’t check my message for a few days and then deleted me soon after.

So my question is mostly to the guys, I guess. Why did he delete me on FB? Is it because of all the fighting over the project? Or because I was someone he liked (if he did like me) and then I kept on criticizing him and hurting his feelings? To be fair it’s impossible to get a compliment out of me unless you are brilliant…I can be a bit of a hardass… 

Anyways, I’m sorry it came to this and I don’t judge him for what he did, just wish to understand if he has 1000 friends on FB why was is it so hard for him to keep me there?

P.S. I also never posted anything directly on his wall or in the comments and kept all the conversations private.

TL;DR: A guy flirted with me and told me he liked me. I didn’t reciprocate out of caution. We got into a fight over a project we both had been working on. He kept a polite demeanor and then deleted me on FB without a warning. Why?

We also spent time together when not in school, like going to the cinema, theatre or for coffee. With Tina I could be always honest and **I knew that she wouldn't spread things I told her**. Though she needed some help with school, as I was always the more responsible and informed one, she was pretty capable to do things on her own and wasn't using me, she just occasionally asked for help. The change in our friendship wasn't abrupt, it started slowly and **I'm not sure that I understand what happened**.

I had a crush on a guy in our class for about a year and then in the 2nd school year, actually became a couple. When the situation didn't seem that reciprocal in the beginnings, Tina was always supportive and enthusiastically asked about every detail of our interactions. When John and I began asking each other to hang out and then it was just the two of us, Tina stopped being excited for us. A bit later **she talked about my relationship behind my back** (John and I didn't come off very well) to some other girls while claiming she would never say anything when I asked her. I still remember that when me and John actually started dating almost 2 years ago, I didn't tell her immediately, because she **seemed off** in the time coming up to it.

**Now, me and Tina almost never talk**. Last year was OK, but this year she started completely avoiding me. I didn't overly share relationship details, I never ignored her and **stayed the same in communication towards her**, I cared and asked about how she was, etc. Due to my job with inflexible schedule and other things I fell out with the girl friend group we put together with Tina. I couldn't make it to the cinema in time from work, sometimes I was just too exhausted to go out at the end of the week and even though I made effort to see them, in time, they stopped including me. There used to be 5 of us and we all had a lot of our minds with school, we all sort of fell out at some time in the last year. I was always the closest with Tina and I never saw the group as a sorority of sorts, I enjoyed talking to other classmates and friends, too, and the girls were not very inclusive of people outside of the group and **enjoyed gossip far too much for my taste**. When me and Tina do talk at school and in between classes, we still share interests and inside jokes, we talk quite a lot, but **only when there is just the two of us, otherwise she mostly ignores me**. Whenever I mention getting coffee together it seems like and option, but it never comes to it. **She never replies to friendly texts and only texts me when she needs something**.

**As I see it, Tina *probably* became jealous of me, started gossiping about me behind my back, became closer to another girl friend, now doesn't even want my company and possibly thinks that I'm a horrible person and only occasionally asks for something for school, because she knows that I'm too nice not to help her out when she needs it**. 

**I see why I could be better off without her at this point. The thing is that I'm not sure I understand. Should I try not to be as nice and ignore Tina's requests for notes from lectures she should have taken herself? Does it make any sense to try to talk to Tina about any of this and to try and mend the friendship? Is there any point in calling her out on the weird things that went on, or should I just not do anything and stop worrying. I'm quite sad about what went on with Tina and others' points of view on the situation could help me understand better, because I am a bit confused with what I should do now. I'm not sure if it makes any sense to talk to Tina about all of this at this point, when it is more than a year since we had a 'normal' interaction.**

Ever since I was little, she was really controlling and weird about things. For example I couldn't watch or play Pokemon or video games in general purely because she thinks they're dumb. I couldn't go to friends houses unless she was there because she assumes(and still does) that all men are out to rape me or hurt me. The made me unnecessarily cautious until I was around 16. 


She assumes everyone is out to get her or me or anyone. Like no one can have good intentions. She just jumps to conclusions about anyone and assumes that they don't like her, or that they just don't care. This made me have a really shitty attitude about pretty much anyone and made me feel really lonely, like I was all I had. 


She always says really rude things to me and makes it out to be my fault when I get upset at them. Example: she always thinks I'm on drugs. I give her no reason to, I don't party and have no interest in it. Even when I'm at home, she'll come in my room and randomly sniff me to make sure I'm not smoking anything and get mad at me when she thinks I'm lying. Then when I have to audacity to be offended, she turns it around on me and tell me I'm too sensitive or that I need to grow up. She does this over plenty of things, not just drugs. I can give more examples if needed. 


More recently it's been over my schooling. I graduated in june and she got upset that I didn't want to stay home with her while she watched TV instead of going to the lake with my boyfriend. I would have went with her if she was doing something, but I'm not going to sit at home when I just graduated. 


Skip to today. She was telling me, yet again, that I need to save some of my financial aid money for gas. I was already planning on doing this, and hearing about it almost every day gets old. But then when I get sick of hearing it I'm too sensitive. I had planned on getting all my winter clothes, a new computer, and a new phone and saving the rest. This was gonna leave with with around $500 left. But no, she's still telling me I need to save. 


She also tells me what to do about my boyfriend. I posted about it here before, but she always tells me that if I end up marrying him one day I'm going to be settling. This makes me madder than anything because 1) He's great to me. He calms me down when she makes me feel like shit about myself and makes me wants to be a better person. 2) She likes him, and I get that she doesn't want me to miss out on life, but I told her if I ever feel like I'm missing out or I'm unhappy (READ: I know things can change. I completely realize that I could feel differently about him in the future, but right now I'm happy and I see myself being happy for a long time.) then I will. I'm not a person to sit there in misery or not do anything about it. I've told her that and she still pushes the issue. She doesn't agree with sleeping around, partying, or drinking, so what does she even want me to do?


I just don't get why she accuses me of not caring about anything. It hurts pretty bad because no matter how hard I try, it's never enough for her. I care a lot but having insults hurled at me almost daily has made me pretty numb to it. I stopped letting myself get upset at it a long time ago. 


I'm pretty sure the only reason she treats me this way is because I act like my dad. He's somewhat irresponsible and has had a problem with drugs before, but is now working and doing good. I just don't see how she thinks my dad=me.

So recently, I have been accepted in graduate school for research psychology.  I am ecstatic to start(in August) and I told everyone in my family(and few close friends) about the news. Everyone says good luck and congrats, except for my cousin. We can call him KG.

Instead, KG tries to tell me that research in psychology is boring and that I should do something more interesting or do med school as he presumes that med school is an automatic get rich after graduating kind of thing.  

I told him that I wanna do research the rest of my life. KG than says Dang, you wanna spend you entire 20s for more school? Crazy. 

And I said I'm just doing what I love. 

He then blabbers how med school is gonna make me more money and that I have to kiss a lot of asses to get grants and beg alumni for money. I try to explain to him that it isn't as awful as he makes it out to be, but he just wants to keep debating with me. Keep in mind, his highest level of education is barely finishing high school. 

He then goes on that he is smart and that school doesn't mean intelligence. I agree with that comment, but not with what KG implies with it (as in I'm not smart). I just said whatever to change the topic. I hate debating with people over something like this. 

But before we can go to a new topic, he says You should research why it feels so good to cum on a girl's face? and then chuckles. 

That was the last straw. I can't take crap like this anymore. I really don't wanna say or do anything to make him feel bad, but he really annoys me.

We've been steadfastly friends throughout. She's always been a good friend to me. We understand each other without speaking. We made future plans together, and were excited to move in together after high school. I value her friendship incredibly.

Or, so I thought.

In July, I introduced her to my boyfriend of 1 year's older military brother. I thought they'd be a good match, and I was half-right. They took to each other immediately, and have been dating since then. My way of thinking then was that we would finally be able to spend more time together (she has a five days a week out-of-town job) since we would both be at our boyfriends' parents' house on the weekends. However, since she started dating Jake and becoming actively involved in my boyfriend's family life, some things that I apparently overlooked about her have come to light: she's a highly controlling person, she likes to buy brownie points by doing immense and unwarranted favors for Jake's parents and my boyfriend, and she really likes talking about me and my boyfriend. And not in a remotely healthy way at all. She talks about how my boyfriend is, in her opinion, abusive, yet Jake confessed to his brother (my boyfriend) that she had been threatening to kill herself if Jake ever thought about breaking up with her. She doesn't know that I am aware of this, and has been feeding me bullshit about how her and Jake are going to get married within a year because Nobody has ever made her think about marriage before, but Jake changed her mind. Normally I would've felt happy for her, but I just don't, because I know more about what's going on than I probably should.

She rubs her relationship with Jake in my face any chance she gets, as well as her wonderful archaeology job, and I have absolutely no idea why.

Our mutual friend came up to visit from an out-of-state university, and while we tried to get all of us together, my previously mentioned friend was unwilling to separate from her boyfriend for more than a few hours. Danielle (my visiting friend) and I spent a lot of time together, and when we finally got all of us together, I had to leave for work. Danielle and my friend spent more time together, where my friend apparently fed her lies that I was moody, secretive, and unstable, so don't make [me] mad if she can help it. My friend wouldn't know about my current emotional state, because she hasn't bothered to ask me how my life is going in months. I've called her several times, upset about all the stress I have in my life, but she doesn't pick up, and when she does, all she can talk about is her wonderful job and her wonderful boyfriend. She also stated that she has no intentions of moving out or attending my university with me anymore, because her plan is to get married to Jake. It really feels like she does not care about me. 

I had hoped by spending more time together we would become closer as friends. But we spend less time together than ever, and every time I see her, I'm filled with hurt and anger. Am I just being resentful? Is this normal? Is there a way around all this and just be her friend? Should I even want to be her friend anymore? I love the old her, not this post-high school version.

                My father had a average relationship with my mother. They had two children, me and my brother, and they split up when I was two. My father got jealous and assumes my mother was sleeping around, though she wasn't. He would argue with her and it ended with a divorce with my mother getting weekly checks from my father for child support. Me and my brother, lets call him Brandon, bounced around between my mother and father. We were always wanted, and things were pretty good for the first 7 years of my life. Eventually my mom was out of places to stay and she moved back in with my father. It wasn't a romantic relationship, but my mother did household chores and bought  groceries. For 3 years all was well, but my parents started arguing when I was around 10. It started out over small things like whether my dad was taking his blood pressure medication or not, or who feeds the cat, but then my dad started working late and he didn't do dishes or clean up. My dad got home before my mother, and he drank as many bud lights as he could before passing out on a couch. The most vivid memory I have was when my mom returned from work at around 10 o'clock. My dad was asleep at this point and he hasn't put any of the dishes in the sink. We had about 3 weeks of cups, plates, and bowls, all dirty and used from a group of 4. My mom got home and was disgusted. She started doing the dishes when my dad woke up and started calling her rude names and telling her to shut the fuck up, you don't do anything around here anyways so just go to sleep! Eventually it escalated from a shouting match to serious threats. I still remember my dad asking You want to fucking die? My mom immediately locked herself in her room as me and my brother hid. My dad went to sleep and the house was pretty much hell for the next 2 years. My parents always fought, which was pretty much just my dad making an ass of himself. The only time my dad was rude to me was when he told me I was a little bitch, and that he wouldn't support me financially if I told my mom anything he said. I strongly support my mother, and told her anyways. Eventually she moved out and we got to spend time out of my farmers house. Things almost calmed down, except for the past month. My dad hasn't been waking my brother up for school, yet he knows he had no alarm. My father was irate that my brother missed school and told him to never blame him for anything, and that if he repeated the conversation to his mother he would disown him. My brother, Brandon, did tell my mom and she kept her mouth shut. That's pretty much all that's happened so far, and I'll post an update If anything huge happens.

We had a terrible, tumultuous marriage. He got hooked on meth, disappeared for long periods of time, cheated repeatedly, lost his job which led to our only vehicle being repossessed and our home going in to foreclosure, and then left me for another woman when I was 7 months pregnant with our youngest daughter. 

I filed for divorce in 2003, after 3.5 years of marriage. He was homeless and unemployed at that point, so I was never able to collect child support. Because of his situation, I was able to arrange for supervised visitation through a local family outreach program. (I was working towards no visitation, but the courts insisted that I try this route first.) After several no shows and finally showing up so high he couldn't remember the girls' names, I was able to suspend his visitation until he could provide a clean drug test. He never could. The last time he saw my daughters, they were 3 and 1. 

There's so much more to the story about his inability to be a decent human, much less a good parent. For example, he told the court mediator (the only mediation he actually showed up to) that being a dad was too hard and that If I could just sell these girls to someone else, I would. I don't have time to worry about this crap. This is only one of a thousand examples. Let's just say he was an unfit father and leave it at that. 

In 2005 I married an amazing man named Aaron. Our families go back several generations and I have known Aaron my whole life. Two months after we got married, we began paperwork for a step-parent adoption. We were able to locate Dave through a family member I tracked down on Facebook. He was served all of the necessary paperwork and notified of the court date. He did not show up and the adoption went through uncontested.

 
The girls are now 14 and 12. Aaron's the only father they have ever known. They know that Aaron and I were not married when they were born, but they have always assumed he was their biological dad. We never told them otherwise because we never wanted them to know that they were essentially abandoned by Dave. 

I recently got a Facebook message from a woman named Effie, claiming to be Dave's wife. She said that Dave was killed in prison last week, where he was doing time for manufacturing and distributing methamphetamines. (I was able to verify all this through a few Google searches) She gave me his funeral details as well as pictures of the three children they had together. She talked about how much Dave loved my daughters and how he constantly spoke of them. I have yet to respond to her because I honestly don't know what to say. 

Aaron feels like we need to tell the girls everything. They're plenty old enough to hear the truth. Now that there's biological half-siblings out there, the odds of one of them getting in contact with our girls are pretty high. 

My problem is, I feel like we waited too long to tell them the real story, and Dave's dead, so what does it matter? Aaron always has been and always will be their father. I'm worried they will have this romanticized notion of some secret biological father superhero that they will never know. Dave was a piece of shit, plain and simple.

Though if you do get on her bad side. Let's just say you don't want to get on her bad side. So my mate tells me that he has feelings for this girl and i think it's great and I genuinely believe that he has a chance with this girl. I egg him on and encourage him cause he is also kind of shy when it comes to girls (Inexperienced). We talk about him asking her out for a few weeks and he starts dropping hints here and there. However she then announces that she has a crush. She tells everybody in our class as we are also a close group of friends but she never reveals the identity. My friend and I take this as an idea that the girl might actually like him back and they begin talking heaps more. *You may need to know that though we are friends I am not really close with everybody in that group as I was new and didn't really talk to this girl much. This will become more important as we continue through the timeline.* The mate and the girl continue conversing for a few more weeks at a more intense rate. 

At the same time I'm trying to get to know more people from this class and I found Mate number 2 who was also really close with this girl. He starts asking me questions about me and I take this as a normal conversation. He starts asking me questions about my relationship status and I take this as him hitting on me. I explicitly tell him I'm not gay but he starts bursting out laughing saying it was for the girl. The same girl that my mate fancies. 

I think nothing of it and continue. Fast forward my mate tells the girl best friends and they tell him that they will find out whether or not she fancies him. Turns out the one she fancies is me. I do not have the mutual feelings, I tell my mate that I'm sorry that it turned out this way he says it doesn't bother him but it clearly does. Fast forward a year classes change and I'm no longer in the same classes as my mate and the girl but we still talk. Throughout the year my mate had gotten over her due to the holidays and the other people he had been meeting. He finds out that he is now in more classes with her. They begin talking again and start hitting it off again, awkward conversing is gone by this time and it's like it never happened. 

Surprise Surprise he begins developing feelings for her again, there's a formal party/get together occurring at the end of the year and the people invited are asked to bring a partner of their choosing. I ask one of the girl's best friends and she says yes. My mate asks a childhood friend and she says yes, turns out she doesn't want to go with him because she does not find him attractive. I find out about her bitching to her friends laughing about it... I tell my mate about the situation leaving the part out about his attractiveness and just tell him she doesn't want to go with him. He decides to go looking for someone else. Lands upon the girl, he asks her and she says yes. At this point a large amount of the people invited have already chosen their partners and there are not many people left. They begin talking again and he begins fancying her again. I don't have a reaction to this as I don't want to encourage him into something I know nothing about learning from my mistake last year. Turns out she still likes me from last year her feelings have stayed the same and we hardly even talk to each other. At this point my friend doesn't know because I didn't want to tell him. 

Weeks past and I host a party, the two main protagonists are invited and he tells me he's going to make a move and he's sure something is to come of it. I tell him that she has really high expectations but it doesn't matter to him. It is true that she does as she is quite the specimen herself(Not just looks). Party begins, friends I haven't in 5+ years arrive and we begin talking at this time one of them is talking to the girl and they are drinking. Next minute he takes her out and they smooch. My friend sees the whole thing and  is heartbroken. I try and comfort him, I suck at it. I'm sitting down on a chair and the girl is destroyed. She can hardly talk and she sits next to me, puts her head on my shoulder she's saying she's going to vomit so I don't want to make any sudden actions. I start talking to her about her feelings for my mate. She says he's just a friend and would never get with him. My face when she sudden gets mad when I ask her why. I stand up slowly and walk away, look back and she's staring at me. Fuck me. 

Fast forward again and things are getting tense between my mate and the girl. He must be angry that she got with a guy that wasn't him and I don't know what she's mad at at the time even now I don't understand. Things are getting tense and long story short she says that she does not want to even think about him. Don't know if they are still going to the party as a couple but things just are at a standstill. 

2 weeks ago there was another party. Both the girl and my friend were there as was I. He gets destroyed as he is a lightweight and that's what he does at parties. He get so drunk that he can hardly walk. Comes up to me and says It's all your fucking fault she hates me. I hate you so much, you ruined it. I want to punch you in the face. At this point I don't know what to say because he has not shown any of this aggression prior to the party.

It has been 2 weeks and I find it hard to talk to him directly. After these incidences he has shown outbursts of anger and it's not like him. He picks fights with people from the class for no reason and nearly destroyed 2 of his own friendships due to this. After these events I find it hard to even look him in the eye. I haven't talked to him directly in a while whereas before I would talk to him 4 hours straight in a call. All of it has changed and I'm lead to believe that it is my fault. I am sorry about me blabbering and including unwanted information but I'm tired and need to go to bed. What do you think could I have done anything to prevent all this please help. Any advice is gladly appreciated. I also apologise for any grammatical or spelling errors.

My relationship to my parents has always been VERY difficult. When I and my sister (now 16) were younger we used to hide under our beds, crying, because we thought our mother was a monster that had eaten our real mother and now only looks like her. She hit us since I can remember, all of our family knew of it but nobody helped us or talked to her about it even when we begged them to do it. I always tried to stand in for my little sister and protect her so I always said that things were my fault and took the punish on me. So I have always been the unwanted child. My parents said openly that they prefer my sister over me and once even that they wished I would have never been born.

My sister and I try to stand together against them. My mother often whats to talk to me, she wants me to stop talking to her and being a bad influence on her. Last week she told me to stop making her addicted to stupid games (I played a game of league of legends with her). She said she knows that I only want to destroy her life and that I am happy when she gets bad grades at school.

My mother also used to tell me and my sister that we are fat and ugly very often - untill I started to do the same thing to her. My sister even refused to eat for some days because of this, she was very thin back then, now she is back to normal.

I felt hated and miserable for a long time until I discovered that a girl from my school has similar problems with her father. We talked a lot, also about the depression we both suffer from. She encouraged me to go to a psychologist who told me that I have not only depressions but also very strong problems with aggression and trust issues. I should visit another psychologist who is specialised on teenagers but I cannot bring myself to call her.

Another problem is my father. He never used to choose a side when I fought with his wife. But last month when I texted a friend about something my mother wanted to know he suddenly screamed at me to put down my phone. I said something like just let me finish this message and he jumped up and punched me in the face. He never did it bevor and I did not see it coming but my first reaction was to punch him in the stomach an run to my room. Since then he goes insane when ever I do something wrong.

This includes also answering yes, just one moment when my parents ask me to do some house work instead of dropping everything I am doing and start following their order immediately. 

I am planning to move to my boyfriend when I am 18 and attend a university near his home town. When I told my grandmother about it she told my parents. They cannot keep me from moving there since i am 18 then they want my grandmother to buy a house in the town I am going to live. I always thought she is the only sane person in my family but I was wrong... My parents have allways been verry controlling, for example wanted to have my facebook password, read my email, ...

I REALLY have no idea what to do. Going to the police is no option since I am going to write my a levels in a month and I need to concentrate on studying.
I am also afraid of moving to my boyfriend in july because we are only together since november and since he is from another country the longest time we have seen each other at once is a week. I am afraid that our relationship will break when we suddenly live together in one house and see each other every day. And what should I do when it ends? Then I would be in a strange country with no friends and no place to sleep. But I cant stay at home any longer...

17625,Non-Romantic,1vofc9,"So basically, last fall was my first semester at university. about a month in, I met this girl at a university-sponsored event, and we really hit it off. However at the time, I was really only interested in being friends, and she seemed the same way. Over the next two months, we hung out a lot, she really got into my circle of friends, and we'd go on walks in the evening, and talk about really anything. I found out she'd only ever had one boyfriend before, and that was the previous summer and only lasted a few weeks.

But then, things took a turn for the interesting. One night, we were just hanging out, doing our usual thing. I had just gotten back from going on a date with a different girl, and things had gone decently but I wasn't really into the girl I had gone on the date with. Then, at just kind of a random moment, I looked at my friend, and just kind of thought You know, I kinda wish I'd taken her on a date instead. I thought about it later, and realized that I'd accidentally fallen for this girl over the past couple of months.

So the semester went into it's final month. We hung out an absolute ton, pretty much did everything together. I came close to telling her about my feelings, but the moment was never right, and I was scared she'd say no and ruin our friendship. I asked her once about guys she was into, just kind of in passing, and she kind of deflected the question and didn't give a real answer. Overall, I was feeling decently hopeful.

So then winter break happened. We saw each other 2-3 times over that period, and things were pretty much like they were at school, we hung out and talked a lot. When we weren't together, we texted quite a bit. After the month or so on break, we moved back on campus, and everything changed. Over the past week, I've texted her sporadically, and she either responds with monosyllables or doesn't respond at all. We haven't had a one on one meeting, and she seems to prefer to hang out with our mutual friends over me. When we do see each other, she tends to ignore me, and respond to anything I say to her mostly sarcastically. 


---   
**tl;dr**: Boy meets girl at university, they hit it off as friends, boy starts to like girl, girl seems to kind of like boy, come back from winter break and girl ignores boy almost altogether. So I guess my question is, what happened? Did I do something wrong? What should my approach be, as I still have feelings for her beyond friendship?

17646,Non-Romantic,2wup2t,"I'm a 23 year old woman. I spent a big chunk of college depressed, insecure, and struggling with a lot of identity issues. I ended up in a really serious relationship for a few years where I unintentionally isolated myself from most people apart from my SO at the time. The few individuals whom I did become close to during this period were either friends of my then-boyfriend or people struggling similarly in their lives. I basically made no effort to get to know people otherwise.

Since graduating in 2013 I've made it a huge priority to get my life together. My college boyfriend and I broke up. I took measures to discover who I am and to live life in a way that makes me happy and proud. I would say my life now is better than ever. I've made more friends in the past few months than I have in the several years before and have a vibrant social life. I go to therapy regularly. In general I'm pretty fucking adamant on both being myself and bettering myself. 

Recently, though, I've realized that I like a number of my college friends much, much less. When I didn't have a strong sense of identity and felt angsty and lost all the time I was basically friends with anyone who was nice to me. Now I've come to realize that I have drastically different values and interests from some of them. The friends who I used to mope around on the couch all evening with complaining about how much we hated everything and how much our lives sucked -- I feel like my life is pretty good these days and they're still in that same spot with no efforts to change. I have interests and ambitions that I'm passionate about now and it makes me uncomfortable when I hang out with formerly good friends who are still self-identifying as losers and want me to relate to that. I also have other friends who, for example, used to seem endearingly bro-y but now just get on my nerves with their constant frat boy posturing and vaguely misogynistic sense of humor. 

These guys are genuinely good people who've supported me through a lot and I would absolutely be there for any of them in a time of need (and have been time after time throughout the years). But I don't enjoy spending time with them anymore, and little things about them get on my nerves far more often than they used to. I understand that relationships fizzle out over time, and to be clear I do have a lot of old friends whom I still hold dear, but the idea of drifting apart from other people whom I used to be deeply close with makes me sad. 

Does anyone have words of wisdom about this? Ways in which I can handle the falling-out as maturely as possible? Thanks in advance.

***

For reference, I'm 17 years old, I'm gay, and I've been out of the closet for almost five years now. I'm well adjusted, and I have great, loving parents who (I think) raised me well. I'm a good student, and I'm headed to a good university next fall. I don't see myself as a socially awkward person. In fact, I'm rather extroverted, and I have a largeish group of great friends. 

I'm not trying to inflate my ego here, but rather provide context for my situation. I'm not a creep or a weirdo (sorry, Thom Yorke). I'm just another teenager putting in his time like everyone else so he can move on to uni.

Anyways. This all started when I met one of my current friends, we'll call him Jack, through a mutual friend. Jack's an interesting guy--very intelligent, and articulate to boot. We became fast friends. I would always chill with him at parties that we were at, and I ended up skyping with him frequently. Jack would sometimes ask me for help with editing a paper, which I gladly did for him. One of the papers I helped him with went on to earn a grade of 96%, so we were stoked about that. We started to become close, and after he broke up with the girl he had been seeing when we met, we grew even closer. 

I see Jack in person quite a bit during the school week, which is an insanely busy time for me, and at least once every weekend. I can honestly say I spend more time with him one-on-one than any of my other friends.

As a result, I've grown very fond of Jack. In *that* way. He's grown very fond of me. I have a strong feeling that he wants to be in a relationship with me (less than subtle hints about wanting to be together, lots of touching and prolonged eye contact, sexual/romantic comments, other things), but we haven't quite gotten there yet.

However...

One day when Jack and I were hanging out, he told me something that disturbed me a little bit. He was talking about his stepmom, whom I've met once, and her impression of me. Apparently, Jack talks about me at home a lot, including the fact that I'm gay, and his stepmom doesn't like me one bit. 

She thinks I'm untrustworthy because I introduced myself and offered my hand to shake when I first met her. Seriously. 

She also thinks that I'm creepy and I shouldn't be hanging around kids that are Jack's age. When Jack explained to her that I'm a year older than him, she maintained her stance saying that, regardless, I'm a predator and he oughta watch out that I don't turn him gay. (It might be worth mentioning that I've had a full beard since I was 15. It makes me look way older than I am) Also, I'm apparently dishonest, and a cheater for helping Jack out on his English papers.  

I asked him if it was unusual for her be so rude and assumptive, but apparently this wasn't the first time Jack encountered problems with his stepmom. She's a textbook \/r/raisedbynarcissists nparent, and she blames Jack for everything: from the cluttered state of their house to the poor state of her and his dad's marriage. I've told him that he only needs to wait two years until he can move out and go NC, but it's still a shitty situation.

Sometimes I feel, from the tone of his texts and his calls, that I'm one of his only escapes from his home life. It feels terrible to try to comfort him, knowing that I can't do much from where I'm sitting. Also, I know I'm leaving for uni in six months, which feels even worse, knowing that I'm leaving him here.

***

So this is where I stand: I really, *really* like Jack, but I don't know how his stepmom would react if she knew about the extent of our relationship. This is especially concerning because I'm turing 18 soon, and I don't want her to ruin my life with any accusations of being a predator. I also don't know what to do about his home life, which is terrible at best.

So we left the country, moved in with my in-laws over seas and hope for him to get a good job so we can pay off all our debt. Everything was good, he found a good job and we were happy. 

Fast forward to May my husband is on a business trip while I went back to Canada to visit my family and attend my friends wedding. On the trip he decided to sex talk with other girls and send picture of his dick, signed up for Ashley madison and pretty much wanted to fuck around.. I returned form my trip, so did he and I was very shocked to find out what he did because the whole trip, him and I always talked, sent pictures and sex talked all the time! How was that not enough for him that he needed to cheat on me. I was heartbroken, lost and was pretty sure I was going to kill him. I was six weeks pregnant and going crazy. How could he do something like this just a couple days after we found out we were pregnant?
 
His mom had a talk with me and pretty much blamed me for what happened. She said “how could I leave him on a business trip and go to Canada when I know my husband has needs. Going to Canada was a mistake and that I should know how to control him.” I packed up my bags, called my dad and took a flight to Africa to go spend some time with him and my mom to clear my mind. The day I left my mother in law said some very terribe things about me. She called me horrible names and accused me of things and pretty much blamed me for everything bad that happens. 

My husband got an apartment and bought some furniture and we decided to work it out, just him and I for now and if I can’t I would leave to Canada. A few mins before I got on the flight he calls me and tells me he lost his job and his boss is not going to pay him any of his salary. He owes him around 14k. What TO DOO? I was literally sitting beside the gate, my son and I about to get on the plane. I got on the plane and went back to my husband anyways, what other choice do I have? I can’t let him go through this alone. We lost the apartment and had to stay with his sister. We put pretty much all the money we had knowing that he would get his pay beginning of July but he got screwed over hard. 

Its been two months since I left to Africa and I haven’t spoke to my mother in law or my father in law this whole time. I’ve been back for a month and not even one phone call to see how I’m doing. I mean I am pregnant all alone with none of my family or friends in this country. We have been homeless, running out of money and I have no residence here so I can’t even go see a doctor for my check ups. My husband is applying for jobs but no luck. 

Today my husband told me that there was a job offer for me. I would be working as a teacher’s assistant until I give birth and I can continue the job after. Also they will cover for my son’s fee so he would be attending the same school as I work. The only thing is the job offer is coming from my mother in law. I haven’t spoke to her about it, but this is what she told my husband. I want to take the job for now, we need the money but accepting the job means that I accept what they have to say about me and allow them to treat me the way they want. We would have to move in back with them for now until my husband finds a job because my salary alone wont be enough to rent a place and live off it. 

My other option is going back to Canada and starting fresh. We would be staying at the parents’ house until we get a job and move out. I don’t know what to do? My husband and I have been married for 5 years and they have always said very horrible things about me when they are mad. Its never going to change and if I accept this job its just going to be another episode where they mistreated me and I forgave them without them even apologizing or acknowledging what they did wrong. To them, they are helping us out so they can say and do as they wish to us. 

WHAT DO I DO?? Do i take the job and allow people to disrespect me or do i return back to Canada and build something for myself and kids.

So this past weekend. My fiancé(chris), my best friend(becky), her friend(steph), and I all went out to a bar. Chris had an attitude so we left early. When I talked to him about it the next day he basically said it was cause of me and my behavior that he wanted to leave the bar. I told him I feel like every single time I'm having fun he becomes miserable and a downer when we are out with my friends. But then when we go out with certain people he wants to hang out with he's completely fine. He made a comment about how he enjoyed hanging out with steph. Fast forward to yesterday. I'm talking with becky and steph about our conversation chris and I had where he was basically telling me I was belligerent. (I know I wasn't I was completely coherent and aware) Becky tells me she was hurt that he said he enjoyed having fun with steph and that she felt left out. And she thinks she's the problem even though I explicitly told her he said my behavior was why he wanted to leave the bar. Steph stepped in and said that's not the case and explained how hanging out with her and I can really make someone feel like a third wheel, and that he was just basically acknowledging that it was nice to not be the third wheel.

Becky then proceeded to say how she feels chris plays favorites with my friends. And she doesn't appreciate that she's not treated equally to kayla and emily (2 of my other close friends). She feels he plays favorites cause they're skinny and cute (becky is 300lbs). There is history between chris, Emily, and I. And she means things like sitting on the couch and cuddle with them and giving them hugs when they leave. I asked Chris if those behaviors could stop as I found it to be uncomfortable. That was about 2 years ago, and he has since stopped behaving that way. 

But I can't help but feel like we are comparing apples and oranges. Kayla and emily both have flirty bubbly personalities. Becky is very closed off and guarded, and her attitude about things can be very off putting. In a sense Becky can be viewed as very standoffish. I've explained to becky that I asked chris to stop behaving those ways with kayla and emily as it makes me uncomfortable. But it still keeps coming up. I feel like she's looking to make her weight the problem. Or looking for justification. I don't even know at this point. It's making me uncomfortable at this point. I'm not quite sure how she wants to be treated because I also know that on occasions when Chris has been joking with her she has become very upset. I'm not sure how to approach this.

This summer, while I was job searching, his mom offered me a full time position with her. I took it, but when I told her I wanted to start paying rent, she said it was fine and to save my money. I just feel so bad, because back at my house having someone over for just a day seemed like such a burden on my parents, so I guess I feel the same here because I've been here for almost a year.

17676,Non-Romantic,1wzr65,"Okay, so let's call her (25f) Amy and my boyfriend (28m) Steve. So, Amy and I met a year ago and really hit it off, I mean really. She's the best friend I've ever had; we share a connection that’s like no other I've had with a friend. We've had amazing adventures together; go to concerts, hike, camp. She's like my soul mate in a best friend form.. for the record we have messed around before, she's the only girl I've been with but she's been with a few. Anyways that's kind of irrelevant, just thought I'd throw it in. 






So I started dating Steve in May of 2013 and things have been great with him, he's in a band with Amy's boyfriend and they're best friends. For months things were amazing, we'd go on super double dates and take trips and go to big events together. We all hang out as a group a few times a week at least, usually I see her once a day and I see him once a day too. The four of us have grown really close. Her and her boyfriend have been living together for about 3 years, but things aren’t going well and they're in the process of breaking up. It's been hard to deal with, especially since this is her boyfriend’s first real relationship. Things between them got abusive, I do believe her boyfriend is a good person, who doesn’t know how to handle heart break and things got out of hand. (more emotional then anything, and the physical was once during one very bad fight, but still not okay but that’s a separate issue) They've worked on it but she's checked out of their relationship and wants to move on. All of this happened before Christmas and they're still living together. 






So in December things with Steve were good, but I was hesitant to move in with him or anything because I've lived with my boyfriend in the past and I want to really wait until I make that move again. So in December Amy and I made plans to move to another state together for better work opportunities and cheaper rent for a 2BR. I told him that if Amy and her boyfriend break up, I'll move to ___ with her. He said he hopes it doesn’t hurt our relationship, and he knows I have to help her and also I need to get out of our area because it's a dump and there's not opportunity and I'm sick of living at home. We decided to cross that bridge when we get there, and we both value our relationship.   That was December.






In the last few weeks things with Steve have been great, I fell in love with him in the late summer early fall, and I feel like I've fallen in love with him again, and I know this is right now. He said if I move away, he'll hate to leave things here because he's invested in his band but he knows at the end of the day he'll want to be with me, and he'll fallow me. We talk about living together and starting our lives together. We have intertwined our life plans and goals in a way we'll be able to support and help each other reach personal goals and our goals together.






SO I Talked to Amy about this, and she says she's happy for us and we're all willing to move into a 2br and Steve and I can share a room and she can have her own and we'll split things three ways. This seemed like the most simple and cheapest solution. However, Steve brought up a good point that for her boyfriend, he's going to lose his girlfriend who he thought he was going to marry, his best friend/band mate and another good friend. He's going to feel completely abandoned and like we all plotted against him, which in retrospect we kind of did. I don't want us all to leave him, I care for him as a friend and I care for Steve and his relationship. 






In the last two months things have changed for me a lot. Like I said, I want to be with Steve and if I move five hours away we can try long distance, and we both said we would put our all into it to make it work... but I'm scared this will ruin my relationship. 







Amy cannot afford to live on her own. She just can't. To make matters worse she wants to continue her education which I have been encouraging her to do, but it's another huge expense that will make it hard for her to be on her own. She has to pay down student loans before she take out more. I made an arrangement with her in December for us to move in the early summer (because we both need to save some money up, and she's not ready to end her relationship but that's another story) Since I made this arrangement my feelings for Steve have grown so much and I want to bring our relationship to the next level.






I love Amy, and I want the best for her. I feel like I cannot abandon her, I can't back out of this because I'm her only option. I'm worried if I don’t do this she won't be able to go back to school and further her career and over all life. I'm terrified to lose Steve, and I'm terrified to lose Amy. If I tell her now, it gives her months to plan, but I don't know if I can do it. I don't know. Do I have the right to? I made a plan with her how can I just back out of it? What will she do?

I made plans with my best friend to move out together this summer, due to financial hardships she needs a roommate and I'm pretty much her only option. However I've fallen very much in love with my boyfriend and want to move in with him in the upcoming months. What should I do?

I'm very lucky in that they pay for school and don't charge me rent, but have been made it very clear that I am expected to work, not so that they can charge me rent, but just so that I can have pocket money and eventually be able to move out when I'm able.

I've been unemployed since July, when the small family company I worked for moved to a new location halfway across the state, and it wasn't worth it for me to make the daily commute. Since then, I've spent many hours each week applying for jobs while keeping up with schoolwork. I have had a couple of interviews, but none of them resulted in a job. I have worked for several years in both retail and fast food in a management capacity, but overall I don't have much in the way of professional qualifications until I finish my degree, so the jobs available to me are limited.

I was very happy today to get a call from the manager of the local Burger King, who set up an interview with me tomorrow for an assistant manager position. Given that most of my experience is in this area, I'm confident that I can impress him and am hopeful that I can land this job. It's also about a five minute drive from my house, so that's a huge plus. I was excited to tell my mom (57f) about it when she came home from work, expecting she'd be happy that I'd landed another interview.

Instead, she immediately expressed her disapproval and said that she would rather I didn't work in fast food. After conversing with my father in another room, she came back and informed me that they were in agreement that I shouldn't go work at Burger King. Now, this is the first time this has been brought up. I have always been under the impression that I am to take the first job I can get... even in my mother's words, This job doesn't have to be your career, it's just to tide you over until you find something better. She has expressed concern in the past when I have worked at other restaurants that it is bad for my health... I did gain a fair amount of weight at previous jobs, and have since lost it, so some of this is concern for my health, but I never imagined that she would go so far as to explicitly tell me not to take the job, nor did I ever get the impression that I was to avoid applying to such positions.

Now she wants to sit down with me tomorrow (before my interview!) and look at some job postings she's found. Until this point, she has never taken an active role in my job search... now suddenly she's hell-bent on helping me find something, *anything* other than this job.

I'm confused because of this sudden change of attitude. Am I overreacting? Am I right to be bothered by this? Or is there something I'm missing here? Any advice is appreciated.

17682,Non-Romantic,2m2lif,"I know this is a really long read but I honestly have no idea where else to turn.

I am a 21 year old male college student who has been living away from home for 4 years. I have a 17 year old sister who is about to turn 18 in 3 months and has recently been diagnosed with anxiety. She was hospitalized a month or so ago when my parents discovered that she was cutting herself and she made some self harming remarks. She spent a week in a psych hospital and was released saying that she felt better.

Now here is the thing, Before she was diagnosed she had never displayed anything like anxiety and had spend the previous year going out to parties and drinking with her high school friends. This comes in later. So anyway when she was diagnosed my parents where very supportive and made sure she got help. The problem is that since she came back she has said that she isnt able to go to school without panic attacks so my parents talked with the advisor and switched her to online school.

 Then she started saying that she couldn't stand being boxed in and needed to be free to go stay with her friends if she needs to. Now the thing is these are the friends she met while partying so my parents already aren't keen on them. So now she is taking my parents car to go spend the night at these peoples houses whenever she says she needs to. if she doesnt she starts having an anxiety attack and saying that she might hurt herself if they don't let her go.

This is extremely hard for my parents to deal with especially because she sometimes comes home from these friends houses past 3AM and usually smells like cigarette smoke. Both my parents are ex-Air Force and my father in particular has the discipline ingrained in his DNA. To him he sees his daughter dropping out of school and basically holding him and my mom hostage to go see her friends whenever she wants by threatening to hurt herself. So he wants to start laying down the law on her. My mom is worried that by him doing this he could drive her to hurt herself maybe even suicide. So she is basically giving my sister carte blanche to do as she wants under the reasoning that it makes my sister comfortable. This disagreement is destroying there marriage to the point my dad is thinking about moving out.

 I am driving home for a family meeting today and have no idea what to do. I have never experienced anxiety and am so worried that my dad coming down on my sister could push her over the edge. on the other hand it really seems like she is abusing it and it is ruining my parents marriage.

Any advice or help understanding would be amazing, thank you

TLDR: sister diagnosed with anxiety, now is holding self harm as collateral to make my parents have no control over her. Dad wants to lay down the law which may make her anxiety go nuclear. Plz help

I'm the youngest of all my siblings. In May I graduated college and moved back home. I was very nervous to do so because of two reasons:


1. My parents have a *terrible* relationship. They're either screaming nonstop or not talking at all and having whomever is at home be the middle man (so typically, me). 

2. My mom isn't the best mom. There's times our relationship has been great and I've viewed her as my best friend. To the outside world I have the *perfect* mother; behind closed doors she's a totally different woman, constantly blaming others, degrading you, yelling for no reason, and never apologizing for her faults. Growing up with her was not easy, and it caused me to have this weird mixture of being really emotional and being really tough at the same time. I was scared to move back home with my mom because I knew she was only make me feel shitty about myself. 


Things weren't easy when I moved home because a lot of bad things happened in my family (deaths and such, it was just a really, really, really shitty summer). Fast-forward to late September. My parents had the **worst** argument I have ever witnessed. Later that week my dad left for work and never came home again. I love my father, I'm a daddy's girl, so I stayed in touch with him (as did my siblings). 


It was very rough on my mother, but that's to be expected. Being the only one home with her made it rough on me. Just a few things that happened: 
* She began drinking *a* *lot* and I had to stop her most nights
* She would hurt herself (slam head on wall, punch self, etc.) and I had to physically hold her down to stop her
* She would threaten suicide
* She kept my deceased grandpa's pills with her at all times. She said it was to tempt her to kill herself
* She hid the guns we have so I wouldn't be able to take them from her
* She constantly told me every gory detail of how she would kill my father
* She wouldn't eat. I would make her food and force her to eat it, she would then stick a finger down her throat and throw it all back up
* She unplugged the phone and wouldn't talk to anyone
* She wouldn't sleep. I stayed up with her night after night while she cried on my lap. I would hold her, brush her hair, tell her it'll all be okay, and just let her cry.


She told me no one was there for her. She told me she wished someone cared. I told her everything I was doing for her and she denied all of it. She said I was never home, I hadn't been there for her at all and she hates me just like she hates my father. I understood she was having a rough time so I didn't take it personally. 


I came to the conclusion that my mom needed help and that it was more help than her 22 year old daughter could ever give her. 


Not to be selfish, but it was taking a massive toll on me: I hadn't seen my boyfriend, I had neglected all my friends, my health (which is very bad to begin with) was on a big decline, and I had recently started my first big-girl job but was performing poorly due to stress and little-to-no sleep. It had been six weeks and I finally got the courage to say something. We were out at dinner and the timing was right. I told her, I think you need to talk to a professional. 


She got **so** **mad**. In the middle of the restaurant, she blew up at me. She said a lot of nasty things about me and concluded with,
&gt; I shouldn't need a professional because you should be able to help me through this. If anyone needs a professional it's you and your father. 


I was pissed, so I left. I went home hours later and snuck up to bed. The next day I left early for work, when I got home she wasn't there. She showed up a few hours later, came straight up to my room (where I was napping), and started screaming (literally while I was still asleep, I woke up to the screaming). She was blocking my door so I couldn't leave. She screamed for over two hours. After a while I tuned her out, but here's just a few things she said:
* Every time I look at you I see your father so I will never love you 
* You and your siblings can go fuck yourselves
* I don't want children anymore, I want friends
* It was selfish of you to tell me to see a therapist
* You're not strong enough to take care of me and I hate you for that
* No one in my life matters
* I was purposely hurting myself the other night so you would see but you ruined it by never coming in the room
* I've never caused any problems in this family
* I made your live too fucking easy. I wish I made your life hell growing up
* I've never threatened to kill myself (LIES)
* I've never threatened to kill your father (LIES)


In summary, it was bad. **Really** bad. I put on my strong face and tuned her out. I probably looked like a statue sitting there while she said nasty thing after nasty thing to me and I didn't react. I think she hated my lack of reaction so she did something she's never done before .... she attacked me. She came running at me while I was sitting calmly on my bed and she held me down and hit me over and over again. 


My little dog was in the room and took it upon herself to protect me. She started going for my mom, biting her ankles and such. That gave me the perfect moment to jump free, I got off my bed and said, Don't you dare touch me. If you lay one more finger on me I'm calling the cops. 


Not long later my mom left the house, like she totally disappeared for the night. I was terrified and nearly called the cops, but I resisted. Instead I did all my laundry and fell asleep. The next morning she wasn't home when I got up for work, but I could tell she had been there. I went to work, came home for my lunch break (when I knew she'd be at work), and packed a bag. 


After work I left town and sent my mom this text, 
&gt; Mom, I think we both need some space to cope with what is happening in our lives right now. That being said, I am going to [boyfriend's] this weekend and I have arranged to stay at a hotel when I come back here. I will be home, I'm just not sure when. I love you and care about you and I want you to get through this in the healthiest manner possible and I don't think me living at home is helping. Please don't worry about where I am, I promise I'll be smart and safe. Take care of yourself. [Sister], [brother], [brother], and I all love you very much.


Her response? 
&gt; Leave the key when you go. I agree I need to be alone, no one cares, everybody just blames me, I am used to the abuse. Go live your life, I know you have abandoned me. I gave you everything, you took everything. I have nothing left to give.


I went to my boyfriend's for the weekend, then moved into the hotel my dad was staying at. I had planned on it being only a week, but based on my mom's response, I didn't think I was welcome back home. So, I was left to live on a week's worth of clothes. 


I'd like to note that through all of this my siblings were **very** supportive of me. After 2 weeks of my mom being crazy I told them everything and from then on, I kept them in the loop. We all agreed that no matter what is going on between our parents, we would stick together. They are literally my best friends and the only people in the world that have stuck by my side no matter what. I love them so much and seriously wouldn't be who I am today without them. 


Back to the story. Ten days later my mom texted me. She asked if I had gotten the results of my allergy test back (While all of this was going on I had also been having weird swelling of my tongue. For an unknown reason my tongue will swell to the point it was too large for my mouth. Cool.) I didn't respond to her text. Two days later she texted again asking to get lunch. 


I obliged and saw her for lunch. It was odd. She acted like **nothing** had happened and like everything was totally normal. I, on the other hand, was very quiet and awkward (not normally like me). The last time I had seen my mom she had hit me, being around her didn't feel comfortable. 


We didn't talk anymore after lunch until ten days later: Thanksgiving. 


The holidays are a really big deal in my family. It's always just my siblings (sometimes our SO's) and my parents; we have so many traditions and we *always* stick to them. But, this year things were different. My sister decided to host Thanksgiving and she invited my mom (my dad was fine about not going). It was just like the lunch I had with her, she acted like nothing had happened. This excited my siblings because they took that to mean that everything was back to normal, but I knew better. 


Right after Thanksgiving my mom left town, so my dad and I went to the house to get the rest of our things (he didn't have much to get as he knew when he was leaving, but I had only a week worth of clothes, so I got the rest of my things). My mom must have noticed that my stuff was gone when she got back in town, but there was no word from her. 


My siblings and I were unsure what to do for Christmas. Both my brothers and I had agreed with our SO's to do Thanksgiving with our family and Christmas with theirs. So the three of us were out for Christmas (no one has ever missed Christmas in our family before so it's a **huge** deal). My sister and her husband live near my mom but decided they would have their own Christmas, just the two of them. So, my mom was going to be left alone for Christmas and we knew that'd be tough on her. 


I had a brilliant idea. I suggested we pick a date right before or after Christmas to do our own mock Christmas. Literally celebrate Christmas as we normally do, just on another day. Everyone liked the idea so we picked a day. Now all that was left to do was tell my mom (at this point no one had told her they wouldn't be there for Christmas). Everyone **refused** to tell her, leaving me to do it. 


So, eight days after Thanksgiving I sent my mom a text asking to get dinner. No response. 


Four days later she sent me a Facebook message asking if I had any news from the doctor. I responded letting her know I was being sent to a specialist as they think I have a some rare condition. We had a short but good conversation. 


I told my siblings that I had spoken to her, but that she left it that she would contact me to get dinner in a couple weeks. I told them that since our Mock Christmas date is in a week and half, we need to tell  her about it soon. Again, they all absolutely refused to tell her, so I bit the bullet and did it myself. 


I sent her a message two days ago:
&gt; Hey so not sure what you're thinking for Christmas - but I'll be with [boyfriend's] family, [brother] will be with [girlfriend's] family, [brother] will be with [girlfriend's] family, and [sister] &amp; [brother-in-law] are doing their own thing. So we were thinking of doing a Mock Christmas, just a day where we can all get together and have Christmas dinner and celebrate the holidays. We were thinking the [date] if that works with you. We all still want to celebrate the holidays with you but it gets tough as we all get older and such so we thought this might be a good way to make it work. Let me know what you think about it and if that date works.


She responded instantly:
&gt; So you are telling me I'm all alone. Completely great. Nice to know I've been ditched by my family because my husband left me.


I said back to her, 
&gt; No mom, I'm telling you we are all adults and have different plans. It has nothing to do with you or dad, this would've happened anyway. But we feel bad and we want to spend Christmas together, that's why we're suggesting bumping Christmas up a few days.


She hasn't spoken to me since. I send the messages to my siblings. Only my sister responded and it **seriously** pissed me off. She said:
&gt; I never said we were doing our own thing. And I have no idea of [brother's] or [brother's] plans. 


Total *bullshit*. I have in texts everyone saying their plans for Christmas. I have in writing where my sister said that she and her husband would not be leaving their house, they would be doing their own thing. And I have in writing both my brothers saying they would be at their girlfriends homes. I also have, in writing, my siblings telling me I needed to be the one to tell her we would all be gone for Christmas. In anger, I responded:
&gt; You put it on me to tell mom all of this. You told me you would be doing your own thing. [Brothers] told me they would be with [girlfriends]. You were welcome to tell mom on your own terms but you refused and forced me to do your dirty work. So don't you dare place any blame on me. I will not feel bad for missing Christmas, I will not feel bad about mom being angry, and I will certainly not feel bad for telling mom when you were too much of a wuss to do it yourself.


No one has responded. It's been two days. My siblings and I text each other *every* *day*. 


On top of all of this, my doctor told me this morning that my blood work results are very worrisome and they want to repeat them for a third and final time. There's a chance I have cancer. 


I love my mom and I hate that my relationship with her has taken this permanent turn for the worse. And I love my siblings and cannot bare to lose them. I need my family in general. But with all the issues with my health ... I *really* need them now.

She interprets things wrongly, always taking things that you say to them offensively. I know that she's secretly mad at me for something or just plain dislikes me. 

She tells mutual friends about me, and I feel like that is making our mutual friends have a false impression or information about me, because obviously her side of the story would make me appear worse. She can't empathize (or maybe she doesn't want to) and will only have negative things and criticism to say when you tell her about your problems. 

I don't like or trust her anymore but I have to keep being friends with her because we have the same friend group. Honestly I  don't want to care about her but I can't help but give a shit about her because I've known her for so long, and she definitely has the ability to hurt me a lot. 

Obviously I can't just confront her and tell her all the things that are bothering me, because she'll basically just do all of the above which I have just stated.

My husband has been planning this motorcycle rally for months, so I'm not going to ask him to stay home to watch our daughter/his mother, nor is a motorcycle rally an appropriate place for a toddler. I WILL be taking my daughter to her babysitter's house. 

So my question is this: do I risk damaging our relationship that she has been working hard to repair by telling her the truth that I am not comfortable with her watching her granddaughter? Or do I lie to her and tell her my daughter and I are both attending this wedding, and then drop her off at her babysitter's?  Or do something else? I really do love my mother in law and I WANT to trust her, I just don't yet. My daughter is more important. But I don't want to think her being clean now doesn't matter to me. It definitely does. I just need more time.  

**Tl;DR** my recovering addict mother in law is coming to stay with me, and I don't trust her alone with my toddler, especially for an extended period of time. Should I be honest with her about my feelings, or protect hers while they're still so fragile?

17721,Non-Romantic,34p3kr,"Never posted here, or even really been here before. I read the rules on the side and I think this is OK to post here. I'm not really sure what I can do in this situation, but I'm kind of looking for something subtle, I'm also not going to put my entire life on hold to help this guy, he's my cousin, sure, but we've never agreed on much and I only really feel concerned because he's family. Any way I could help him slightly would be great, I'd be willing to go to a little bit of trouble but nothing that involves too much money or too large a commitment.

Saying that I don't feel concerned for him makes me sound like a bad person, but this guy is really pretty terrible, and I could always tell he was going to end up like this ever since we were kids. So when we were little, I used to see him quite a lot, we lived pretty far apart, about an hour drive, but saw each other every month or so. We basically got along, but he always needed to prove that he was the best at everything, boasted a lot and lied all the time. We were all heaps into pokemon when we were young and he'd always throw a tantrum when I beat him, and whenever we played any game he'd always bend the rules and make up his own to try and make it so he could win. 

As we grew older he started making bolder claims, that he represented my state for running even though I could beat him in a running race and I wasn't particularly athletic. He also had a habit of bullying my little brother (3 years younger than me) which I didn't appreciate. He also used my master ball on emerald on a loudred after i specifically told him not to, which will only make sense if you play pokemon, but trust me, it's a terrible thing to do, especially to an 8 year old. Basically he was an obnoxious, lying, bragging bully who made my early childhood a lot harder than it needed to be. 

At about age 12 he transitioned into saying how much he hit the gym and how many girls he got with. It was all total BS, he was scrawny as a toothpick and his stories about girls were all clearly exaggerated to say the least.

By the time I was 13 and my brother was 10, we were done with his shit and would call him out when he lied, it made family meetings more pleasant because we always had a laugh at the dumb shit he said.

When he was 14 his parents got divorced and both his parents' new SOs decided pretty quickly that they didn't want him around, so his parents sent him off to boarding school. This seemed to help at first, the next couple of times I saw him he cooled it a little with the lies and seemed like he was finally growing up.

I was wrong. At age 15 he was found passed out on his school's bathroom floor from drinking too much alcohol. As a little bit of a goody two-shoes I was pretty shocked when I heard this. His school was angry and he came close to getting expelled. A few months later, a teacher found drugs in his dresser in his dorm room, and he was expelled from his boarding school. He claimed that the drugs weren't his, but his tendency to lie was known, and no-one believed him.

He moved back in with his mum, and started going to  a local school where she lived, but he still didn't get on with his mum's  SO, claiming that the SO hit him when my cousin refused to do what he said. His mum saw it and said that he had held him by the shirt and yelled at him after my cousin was being a total asshole. This doesn't sound good, admittedly, especially considering the very real possibility that his mum could have lied to protect her SO. However, given his track record I think it's not unreasonable to take the claims of his mum and her SO over his. Anyhow after this claim he moved back in with his dad, with whom he had been living previously to when he had been sent to boarding school. He has recently been hanging out in a caravan park in the area against his father's wishes and was recently found passed out drunk again and is now refusing to go to school. 

He wants to be a police officer when he's older but I'm not sure how realistic that is given his track record. He has no real alternative though, he's terrible at school, not academic at all. He's not particularly good at sport, music or anything, really. He's not good-looking enough to be a model, he has no trade skill or interest in becoming a tradesman. I just don't really see how he is going to do anything with his future.

His friends are all pretty bad influences by the sound of it, having bad habits and not even really seeming to care about him much. 

Not only this but his living situation is very problematic. Both his parents' Sos don't want him around, so there are arguments whenever he lives with one of them, his sister doesn't have her own place yet, so he can't live with her. My grandma is very old and has multiple medical problems, my cousin wouldn't want to live with her because of the lack of technology at her house, and she wouldn't want to live with him because of his loudness and the fact that she wouldn't be able to stop him breaking the rules. There is no way my parents would let him live with us, and my dad's side of the family want no part of the whole ordeal, so there are basically no options. Like I said he is living with his father right now, but that is likely not going to work long term. 

I don't really like the guy, but he's family and he's been through some tough shit with his parents divorce and he's been dealt a pretty tough hand in life. I mean apart from the whole living in a first world country in a relatively well-off family thing. What I mean is he isn't much good at anything, and I think that's why he feels the need to lie and exaggerate his own achievements, and why he drinks to seem cool. It must be terrible to know that neither of your parents want you to live with them.

Also: I know that there are people who have it worse than this guy, so please no angry rants about how much worse someone else's life is and how this guy doesn't deserve sympathy, there's always someone worse off, I'm aware of that.

I just feel that he has the potential somewhere in him to build a future. If he really does become a cop it might help set him straight, but my main dilemma is for the issues going on right now.

So yeah, any ideas, reddit?

17724,Non-Romantic,2co3n0,"So I had a group of best friends. We called it the triumvirate. We were best beds the last 1.5 years of HS and things shifted up and down since then. Lets call the friend in question Drucker. The other guy can be Cassals. After HS Cassals went to a college 3 hours away. I went to a local community college and Drucker went to a nearby university. for a year things were fine, Cassals dropped off the radar because he partied a lot and was banging chicks (his words) so naturally me and Drucker became closer. We hung out often. 


Drucker was a avid sports and tech fan. He loves new tech. We talked a lot about video games. We sometimes argued because I felt Drucker was close minded. Anyways we talk and I get an attack of what some people call hypochondria. It really affects me and I guess I overburdened Drucker (and everyone else apparently) with my disorder (diagnosed). He stops talking to me because of it. We dotn talk for a year and then all of a sudden he gets back in contact with me. We bury the hatchet but he does make me apologize which was weird to me because he left me high and dry when I was in a time of need. I guess I overburdened him but I said sorry already. Whatever in the interest of keeping a old and dear friend I do it.  Our friendship fluctuates from not talking due to business/other friends to talking and hanging out. Starting in 2011 he  became even more obsessed with tech. He was a big Google plus fan and bashed on Facebook every chance he got. He also loved a certain console and plugged it every chance he got. To my discredit I kinda argued with him to piss him off. I ended up getting angry too which is stupid and petty of me. He is very stubborn and close minded when it comes to stuff and he wouldnt want to hang out with my other friends who used to be his friends too. He tried really hard to get us on G+ and we did for his sake. It was ok but it was and is a ghost town. Fast forward to today For the last year its been good, we talk and hang out but for the whole last year hes been worried and I mean really putting in a lot of thought into his social media. I mean he has a new(!) myspace account, an account on weibo (hes not chinese hes Salvadorean) and god knows what else. He has so much social media and he constantly talks to me about what he should do. Should I delete my facebook? (he went back and admitted defeat a year ago) Should I post on tumblr? He has a formula for what he posts to tumblr. Which games and movies to reblog. What type of reblog to end his nightly posting with. He recently wrote a post about his reasoning about deleting certain social media accounts. Thing is he barely talks to anyone besides me and his family and a few friends. He is a freaking gregarious and charismatic and intelligent guy! Hes smart as a whip and emotionally intelligent for the most part. He is way more likeable than I am, and has all these talents that go to waste. He also seriously frets about the order of which games hes gonna tackle/beat. He has to order them but he never really sticks to the order beyond 3-5 games.  I had a talk with him about how I felt stagnant like I wasnt doing anything and It old him we are young and should be going out there and doing stuff and trying new experiences. Itold him we should road trip and try new things. I told him we need to expand our horizons and get out of our comfort zone. He agreed but said you shouldnt try new things if you dont want to. Hes turned down invites to vegas, hangouts where we try new things, meet new people or basically any hangout where we do more than just eat.


 He agreed with me and then didnt. half of our conversations are him talking about what he sees online and about the order of games hes gonna play and the newest social media account he created or deleted.


Im getting really dismayed at the potential hes squandering his potential, it really bums me out. He seems sorta happy. I cant see any big issues in his life but his life is mostly just gaming, internet and hanging out with friends here and there. Hes been improving lately but he slid back with the recent focus on social media.  Also he had a crush on a girl with depression/suicidal tendencies. She was clearly not interested and got back wit her ex on and off. I talked with him for 4 hours because he didnt know what to do about her on facebook. I told him she didnt seem interested in even being friends. I told him to delete her and move on but he argued with me for 4 hours about it because he thought she might commit suicide because he deleted her or she might one day need to talk to him and he wouldnt be there even though they havent talked in months.


I really feel for the guy. I want to help him but at the same time I am not his mother. I dont know if I should talk with him. also he might get angry/defensive and I might lose him as a friend as he kind of overreacts to things as you can see.

A few things

-hes fucking hilarious


-hes not a neckbeard at all, if he really tried he could cleanup with women


-hes not ocd or anything like that


-he seems happy but hes not one to talk about deep deep problems so i dont know


-hes said hes happy and maybe im injecting my own view too much but I cant see how anyone can be satisfied with their life the way he lives it. It just feels so not fulfilling and robotic sometimes. 
I am not perfect I just want to help my friend.

Dan is my best friend and roommate. We met on World of Warcraft almost exactly five years ago. In December, it will be four years that we've lived together. 

Dan was actually my boyfriend up until one year ago, when I realized I was a lesbian. I know that sounds strange, but he was genuinely supportive a lot of the time and it was easy to transition to just being friends because we had a rocky relationship. We jokingly classify our relationship as 'platonic life partners'. When things are good between us, he's my best friend in the entire world. 

Before I go any further, I'm going to straight up say that I fully realize I'm part of the problem. I struggle with what seems to be undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder (incredibly reckless with money, self harm, gravitate towards intense and unstable relationships, really intense emotions, etc), which I know I need to get help with. I've been through many therapists/psychiatrists where I'm living and the only one I ever felt comfortable with eventually cut contact with me because he couldn't help me. 

As for how that effects my relationship with Dan, I have a history of yelling when I get upset. While I experience very intense emotions (whether it be anger, anxiety, sadness, or even happiness), he's the polar opposite. He experiences intense anger, but other than that he rarely acts like he gives a shit about anything which upsets me because I just don't understand. We argue frequently (usually over incredibly stupid shit) and I do sometimes end up yelling, but I genuinely feel that oftentimes he tries to pin the entire argument on me by telling me I was yelling and I swear I wasn't. 

The first violent incident happened a couple of years ago. He went and picked us up some food and we got in a stupid argument about something (I don't remember what it was but it was petty). All of a sudden he snapped, grabbed his food off his plate, and started screaming in my face and slamming the food into my hair. I don't remember everything that happened afterwards but I remember sitting on the floor covered in food sobbing uncontrollably. 

This was the only time he ever really seemed to feel really horrible about what he'd done. He sat down and was almost in tears and just kept apologizing profusely. He swore he was sorry and said that he should just go back to where he lived (another state) before we moved in together. He was (and still is) one of the only people I'm close to, so I told him I didn't want him to go. He seemed genuinely devastated that he'd snapped like that and swore it would never happen again.

Sometimes when it would happen again, he'd blame me because he wanted to leave and I was in his way. However, a lot of times he'd lose his shit and come at me. He'd grab me really hard and shove me. This isn't something that happened often, not that it makes it any better. When things would calm down and I'd ask him what the fuck was wrong with him, he'd always say things like 'I didn't grab you' or he'd tell me it was my fault he snapped because I was yelling. He'd look at me like I was the world's biggest idiot and he'd make me feel like I was crazy because I KNEW what had just happened. 

I read through /r/relationships a lot when I'm bored, and that was how I learned what gaslighting is. I'm pretty certain that's what Dan is doing to me. After these violent incidents, or during fights, it's always shit like 'What is wrong with you? That's not what happened' or picking on the fact that I'm 'overly emotional'. I can't remember a single argument where he doesn't say something to the extent of 'I warned you to stop yelling at me' or 'I'm sorry you're upset BUT you were yelling and I snapped'. 

Now here's the current situation: We're moving to another state on Monday (This isn't one of those 'isolating her from her family' things. I have no family left and moving was my idea; Also, it's to a completely different state than where he's from). Things have been stressful and we've been arguing a lot. We both have a lot of things we've been trying to get done, and he's constantly telling me how useless I am and how I 'never fucking do anything helpful' and put everything all on him. 

Today I asked him if he got around to getting the mover's insurance that he'd agreed to deal with. When he told me he didn't and that we have the shitty coverage from the moving company, I got irritated and tried to explain to him that it's probably less important to him because he doesn't have anything sentimental (which is objectively true; he moved out here with literally nothing and most of his belongings are electronics and things that can be replaced). I swear to fucking god I wasn't yelling. I was annoyed but I WAS NOT YELLING. 

I was sitting on his bed and all of a sudden he's on top of me holding my arms with one hand and covering my mouth with the other. It happened so fast. He had this disgusting hate-filled look on his face and I was screaming for him to get off me and he just kept fighting with me like he was trying to strangle me. He grabbed a pillow and tried to shove it over my face but I guess I managed to fight hard enough because he failed. 

I was crying and yelling at him to stop and he kept trying to cover my mouth and telling me shit like he just wanted me to stop fucking yelling at him. I told him I couldn't breathe and he said that I can obviously breathe enough to yell. 

At one point he got up and I don't even remember what I said but I guess it pissed him off and he DID IT A SECOND FUCKING TIME. Pillow and everything. He got up and just stared at me with this furious, hateful look on his face while I sobbed uncontrollably and kept choking because I couldn't breathe. 

He didn't even feel bad. The only thing I could get out of him resembling an apology was 'I'm sorry, I shouldn't have laid hands on you', but then he'd just go on to blame me for yelling when I really wasn't even yelling this time to begin with. I seriously thought he was trying to kill me. I told him that and he eventually got annoyed that I kept repeating it. He just kept telling me that he wasn't trying to hurt me and just wanted me to shut up. At least other abusers pretend to be sorry.

Later, I had to go ask him something else about the mover's insurance and I was kind of just blankly staring off and he asked me 'why I was wandering around like a lost puppy'. Now he's acting like everything is fine. We ordered delivery for dinner and he's fucking sitting in his room emailing me funny Youtube videos and links to World of Warcraft stuff and joking around when he comes to ask if the delivery driver is on their way yet. What the fuck? I'm starting to think I'm insane because this all just seems too fucking weird to be happening.

I don't know what to do at this point. I've read the same posts all of you have where a girl comes on and talks about her abusive boyfriend, husband, friend, whatever, and I understand how shit escalates. This is the worst it's ever been. I fully realize that if it doesn't stop, it WILL get worse. If I was on the other side of this post reading it, I'd be yelling RUN RUN RUN at my computer screen. 

But then I think about how he's the closest thing I have to family. I lost the only family member I was close to a few months ago. My cat is all I have aside from Dan. And on that note, she has asthma and I'm terrified that if I part ways with Dan and my cat gets sick or something, I'll be too consumed with fear to rush her to the vet in time. I'm sure you'll all think I'm an idiot now, but my cat has been here for me through so much and I'm scared that something bad will happen if I don't have Dan here to drive me when there's an emergency or keep me objective because I'm so emotional. 

Please don't tell me that my life is more important than my cat or something because here's the thing: It's not. I was on the verge of suicide six years ago and the bond I've developed with my cat over the last six years is literally the sole reason I haven't done it, especially after losing someone so close to me a few months ago. 

I know I'm supposed to ask a specific question, but I really just need people to give me some perspective and tell me what to do. I just need help.

17758,Non-Romantic,36ffk0,"Hey reddit community – my SO and I need some help in navigating our amazing (but very needy) families. A bit of background: My SO and I have been dating for 2 years and have known each other for 5. He’s the most wonderful man I know and we’ve discussed marriage several times but are waiting until we are done with our respective graduate programs. Our families are both amazing and we are very close with our respective parents. My parents adore him and I’d like to think that his adore me. Our parents live in adjoining towns, but we both live in different cities (from our families and each other).  We are close enough to our parents to make weekend trips feasible, but far enough away that they can be exhausting given our rigorous work/school schedules. We love our families and have probably spoiled them with constantly coming home in the past for birthdays, all holidays small and large, and every other event. This has been a blessing but, as I'm learning now, also a curse.

My SO and I plan our trips home so that we can see both sets of parents for as much time as possible given the time we have. Yet somehow this ALWAYS leads to problems. Both families want to see more of us. Take this past Mother’s Day for instance – based on when our families were celebrating, we were going to spend time with his family Friday night and my family during the day on Saturday, then go our separate ways with our respective parents Saturday night, then split Sunday evenly between moms. It sounded pretty good to us given the fact that we’re making a long trip home during exams and research. Well shit hit the fan and both moms were unhappy. I’m not a mom, but I guess I can understand how they would want more time with us on Mother’s Day (it’s one day out of the year), so we made the decision to go our separate ways again on Sunday. Problem ultimately solved but not without a lot of headache.

So I guess what I’m asking is how to handle these situations in the future. Memorial Day is coming up during which my family typically has a big weekend blowout at a summer home. Now I would love for my SO to join, but I also don’t want to take him away from his family. My family is bigger so we tend to have bigger functions than his family, but that doesn’t mean his family doesn’t deserve time with us. I’m worried that his parents will end up resenting me over the years for taking him away, per se, during those kinds of weekends. So we’ve discussed spending one of those weekends with his family one year and mine the next or dividing the weekend appropriately. Yet whenever I try to tackle this issue with my mom, she launches into the whole “you’re not engaged or married, why do you always have to do everything together why can’t you just split up for a holiday?!” I feel like no matter how hard we try to appease everyone, it always ends up as a mess.

How do I tackle this situation? Everyone I’ve talked to about it always sighs, moans, and says “welcome to the rest of your life after you get married.” If this is going to be the rest of my life, I’d like to learn how to handle it properly with as few hurt feelings as possible. Has anyone dealt with needy families like this before? How have you handled it? How can I improve? Anyone out there who has been in my parents’ shoes and experienced this? Am I totally out of line? I’d love some outside perspective.

17759,Non-Romantic,2yt305,"To give some context my extended family (aunts, uncles, cousins, cousin's children) are very close. We get together for almost every birthday, and every holiday. Most of my cousins have young children now, and though they haven't made the best choices in men, everyone is always welcome to family events and these are generally very happy and fun times. 

The cousin, and by extension her boyfriend, in question has made the biggest mistakes in her relationship and has been causing quite a bit of family drama lately. Her boyfriend (on and off since her teens) recently got out of a long stint in prison and they just had a baby together. For years my cousin has been working very hard to build a life for her and her oldest daughter; taking night classes for college, working hard, and building a home. When her boyfriend came in the picture everything went down hill as you can expect, and it has been a constant back and forth of breaking up and getting back together. Even with all of this my family has just stepped back and supported her when need be. The boyfriend, her, and her children have attended all family events without incident and we have just been glad to have my cousin around. 

Recently though, it has came out that he has been physically abusive to her in front of her children. My mother was a witness to this a few weeks ago and called the police. We finally thought this would be the wakeup call she needed to kick him out of her life for good and move forward with her life. There has been an outpour of support from the family helping her watch the kids, and giving any general support she needed. But of course she has let him back in her home and they are together again. 

With this last set of events I just don't want him in my home for Easter and around the rest of the family. My family is very good at ignoring the bad to have a good time together, but this has just been the final straw in my mind. The problem is though, I am afraid that if I speak with her about not allowing her boyfriend to come, then she will refuse to come either and not let her children enjoy Easter with the rest of the family. I know that if this happens it will heavily effect the mood of the rest of the family and day. I can't stress enough how close our family is. 

The question is, is there a good way to talk to her about not wanting her boyfriend there or should I just keep my mouth shut and let things continue as normal for this Holiday?

As a side note, yes multiple family members have spoken with her, including myself, how terrible this man is and what he is doing to her. We have all tried to get her help and make her see the terrible ways he is effecting her life. But she is an adult and at the end of the day it is her decision to be with him. We will always love and support her no matter her choices. 

EDIT: Thank you all for your advice. Most of them were wonderful suggestions and I feel much better about going into the situation. My plan is to talk to her in private again about how I feel about the situation and that my negative feelings about him, and him coming to Easter, are not on her and that we all still love her and hope to see her and her kids there. As for the abuse, this has been a recent revelation (though I'm sure its been going on longer than we know) and her mother is working on trying to have the kids stay with her until my cousin can be in a safe place. The rest of the family has my support in this decision and I will be sure to update. Maybe grandma can convince my cousin to at least let the kids come with her if she decides not to come...

17790,Non-Romantic,283s9v,"So this has been the worst goddamn day, as you can guess.

I'm a PhD student at a school in a nice, but expensive area. I'm lucky enough to have a really nice, inexpensive house (landlords cover all utilities and haven't raised rent in a long time) and two cats who I love dearly. My roommates like them too, they even named one of them, though they other is a big neurotic (classic fraidy cat--doesn't cause any problems, but is mostly scared of people besides me so spends a lot of time hiding). I moved in over distance and before I did (though it may be after I signed the lease--but still months before I moved in) I told them I was allergic to dogs and would prefer not to have dogs in the house. No one had a (permanent) dog at the time. A couple of times two of them have mentioned really wanting a dog and I've said I'd prefer not, but it might be okay if they were short-haired and the house was kept really clean. Usually these were brief episodes of a day or two and then it just faded away. A few times we even had puppy guests for a few weeks (rescues, babysitting) and it wasn't awful and my roommates always voluntarily got rid of them due to their busy schedules. No problem, I thought.

So imagine my shock this morning when we had a house meeting about the lease for the next year, and they said they wouldn't re-sign the lease with me because they want to get dogs. I reminded them I was open to it if they could keep mess and noise reasonable and they basically said no, we're can't, we're not going to. They were concerned it would be bad for my cats. They said there were some other little things but didn't say what. I'm sure I'm not the perfect roommate but I'm not a slob, I try to be considerate and I always fix anything if people complain (which they rarely did). 

These are people I consider friends so I was pretty much dumbstruck. Now I'm just pissed off. I feel like it's partly because my program is more demanding so I spent a lot of time studying (60+ hours a week sometimes) and they have lots of free time to hang out together. I made my needs really clear when there was still time for them to change their minds and they didn't. They literally said they just hoped I would move out after a year. And I'm really worried I won't be able to find anywhere I can afford to live and still keep my cats. Housing here is expensive and I don't have anyone else to look with and they are basically guaranteeing I will pay more for a less nice place. And they also basically said they talked about it behind my back for a long time without bringing up ANYTHING with me. It's my house as much as theirs! WTF gives them the right to rearrange my life for their convenience? 

I don't know what to do because, after they said all this, I was looking over our lease and I realized it's not year-long, it converts to month-to-month after the term is up. My BF (a lawyer) said that they can't re-sign the lease until either everyone vacates, everyone agrees, our landlord evicts us, or some combo of that. Even if I read it wrong they haven't re-signed the lease yet. So I could just tell them I'm staying and to hell with them, but then I have to live with them unless they move out. I also feel like I could tell my landlord, who likes me, and see what happens. I don't know. I'm just flippin mad right now I can't think straight. And how am I supposed to live with them for the next 3 months?

I have been friends with a couple, let's call them Bob and Aerith, since high school. We were pretty close, I moved away for college, they both came to visit me a couple times, and now we're all living in the same city together. 

Bob has always been a stalwart friend. He put me up in high school when my crazy mom kicked me out, he defended me against various bullies, and he let me stay rent-free with him for a couple months when I moved back to this city. I owe the guy big. I know that. I've made a point of acknowledging it and trying to pay it back in the ways I can (running games, cooking meals, etc.) 

Aerith moved to our city a few weeks before I moved out. She and Bob have had a pretty stormy relationship, but they're adults and that's their business, right? Both of them also suffer from some fairly severe depression. I also have a mental illness, so for a long time I wrote off the fact that they never wanted to hang out with me, visit my place, or reply to my texts as just depression - I'll keep making overtures, I've explicitly said I'm here to listen, and they'll socialize when they have the ability to do so. It's not my place to push people, though I'm worried about what seems to be their escalating agoraphobia. 

I invited them to my birthday party, and was incredibly surprised and happy when they showed up. Bob and Aerith told me they wanted to get me a tattoo- something I want badly but cannot afford- and we agreed to go to the shop the following Friday. I was very happy, I had all my friends over, we had cake, it was a great time.

Then the next thing I know one of my friends is pulling me off my balcony where I'm smoking and shooting the shit with some other buddies, because Aerith and Bo are drunkenly screaming at each other in my tiny bathroom. A good portion of my guests just left when that started, and I can't blame them. I manage to get Aerith and Bob seperated, and spend most of the next hour trying to talk Aerith down out of a drunken rage as Bob sits outside my front door and cries. 

I didn't realize at the time how drunk they were- apparently Aerith was taking drinks out of people's hands and finishing them- but I knew that both of them don't handle liquor well, both of them have admitted this, and foolishly I guess I had hoped they would not go balls to the wall at a party where they knew alcohol would be served. Whoops. 

Finally Aerith is calm enough to be around Bob, and another friend drives them home. Pretty much everyone has left at this point, so I sit in my apartment with the people brave enough to stay and proceed to drink heavily.

I call Bob the next day to see how they're doing. He says they're fine. I offer to hang out in a couple days- these are my friends, I'm concerned and all. We make plans, and the day of I text Bob to make sure those plans are still on. He says he'll check with Aerith.

I haven't heard anything from them since.

Y'all, I'm pissed. They pulled a scene out of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf at MY goddamn birthday party, then they blew me off AGAIN without so much as a heads up text, and neither of them have apologized for their behavior. I get depression, I get alcohol issues, I get that mistakes get made, but this is the culmination of months of blowing me off and never having time for me, except when my house is full of free vodka I guess. I don't believe that your circumstances absolve you from the very basic principle of apologizing to people you've hurt- but I'm wondering whether I'm being overly harsh to them by holding them to that standard. 

I have already defriended them both on Facebook. I am considering blocking their numbers. The people I've talked to are evenly split between telling me to just do a slow fade away from Bob and Aerith, because a confrontation will do no good, and telling me that a friendship so long-standing deserves a conversation and a second chance.

17801,Non-Romantic,2qnjcl,"**Backstory:** So I started Media Studies at college (UK) in September, and have absolutely loved the freedom and change in work/lesson styles from my old school. I'm friends with everyone in my group and they're all really cool.

A couple of people in my group were in the year above me at my old school, and knew me due to my sister being in the same year.

I am a massive Lord of the Rings fan. It started when I saw the first Hobbit film with my family and immediately read all the books and saw all the films. I collect Lego sets based off the films and LOTR is basically just my favourite thing.

This was fine up until a couple weeks ago, as quite a few of my college friends have seen Lord of the Rings and a couple even seem(ed) to like it as much as me, we cracked jokes about it, made references and etc.

However, one of these friends, John, recently said that 'I go on about it all the time'. I was aware that I liked it a lot, and talked about it often, but didn't realise that that was a bad thing. I mean, whilst I do mention it a fair bit, it's not like everything I say is related to it, it's just obvious that I like it a lot through the fact that I quote it on occasion and buy products related to it. 

This was amplified recently due to the third and final Hobbit film coming out, which caused me to get very excited and talk about going to see it, the trailers etc. A couple of weeks ago John said in our college group Facebook chat that I 'go on about it so much it's ruined LOTR for him'.

This shocked me at first, and I admit, I was a little angry as I thought that it's a bit unfair to lay that blame on me, as I was just going about enjoying what I enjoy, and it wasn't my fault that he got offended by it. This escalated even more recently, with him removing me from the Facebook chat several times when I mention Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit.

For example, I posted a picture of the new Hobbit Art and Design book I got, and was very excited to look at the costumes and etc., due to my interest in those things (hence why I take media studies), and John removed me from the chat for that alone!

Am I in the wrong for thinking he is being unfair? I really like my new friends and John is a really cool nice guy who I thought liked Lord of the Rings as much as me. I don't want to annoy or upset any of them, as I used to be a dick to my old friends at my old school and regret it now. Sorry for the wall of text, but any help is appreciated!

I'm single and trying to make more friends. I was recently dumped and am not ready to date again. I'm trying to heal and regain confidence and self-love, so I'm getting out and doing things. 

I've been going to Meetup groups. If you aren't familiar with them, they're local meetings for people who are interested in the same things. I'm in these groups: free events, people in their 20s and 30s, people who like to travel, and females in their 20s and 30s. None are specifically for single people or dating.

Most of the time, I get stuck talking to one guy. I don't mean to, it just happens that way. Some people are awkward to talk to (e.g. one word answers) or are too into their established conversations. I'll try to join in, but sometimes they don't open up and just continue talking to each other. You're not always going to click with someone, either.

I did genuinely enjoy talking to these guys, so I gave them my number so we could hang out. From how they contacted me afterward, I'm pretty sure they're asking me on dates. Can I take you out for some drinks? or I want to get to know you better :) One guy contacted me 4 different ways within the first 12 hours of meeting and then asked me to hang out 3 days in a row. I tell them that I'm not interested in dating / would like to just be friends and then never hear from them again.

I don't *think* I'm flirting with them. I smile and laugh appropriately. I don't touch them except to shake their hand. We've talked about science, books, TV shows, traveling, hobbies, our jobs, etc. Not about sex, dating, relationships. I do try to float around and talk to other people, but in general, those conversations fizzle out fairly quickly.

Are the groups too generic? Events for different groups in my area overlap fairly often. So, even if I join a more specific group, sometimes they end up mixing with more generic ones. The generic ones also meet more often.

I recently joined a group for women in my field, so I'm going to see how that goes. The other female group I'm in meets weekly at a time that is hard for me to get to because of my work schedule, so I don't want to rely on that. I also don't think ruling out friendships with men is the way to go. I have male friends who have never wanted to date me, and we have great times together.

What am I doing wrong? How do I be friendly and give off a let's just be friends vibe? How do I give my number to a guy without awkwardly saying outright By the way, I have no interest in dating right now, in the off chance that that's what you want from me? Am I just being a douche in assuming that they want to date me?

Or am I looking at this the wrong way? People need to spend time together to become friends, so maybe I shouldn't be shutting them down so quickly? However, I don't want to lead them on and go on dates when that's not what I'm interested in.

17820,Non-Romantic,35gkmb,"I have a friend who i originally met at work about 3 years ago. He's a 26/M and his girlfriend is a 26/F. I will call my friend X and his girlfriend Z throughout the following paragraphs.  

When we used to work together, I'd hang out with X often since we both lived near each other and knew a small group of people from the same workplace. Eventually, he left for another job in the city but we would still hang out since our small group of people kept in touch. We would hang out less because our work schedules (like 2-3 every two months) but i'd still text him about dumb stuff like fantasy football, movies, or inside jokes, etc.

I believe he's been dating Z for about 5 years now. They live together and have done so for almost 2 years. Initially, she seemed pretty cool but as i started to hang out with both of them more often, I could see that she was very controlling and kind of a brat. For example:

About 2 years ago when I would hang out with them often, we'd plan bar outings on the weekends to hang out with other people. Our area bars close at around 2am. The plan was always to pregame, and head out by 10pm-ish. Every single time we planned something, Z would make everyone wait until she was ready, to the point where it would get past midnight and we'd cancel out going out. She would then suggest to just cancel going out and order food and stay in, that's how every night would end.

One day, we cameback from a basketball game. I suggested we go to a bar and watch a football playoff game and meet up with some people. X was all aboard with that idea, but Z was not. She wanted to watch the game at home and order food and bring people over. She then ordered food to arrive by the time we would get back to their place, only to change her mind and get food from another place. She never called the original order she placed to cancel or apologize. They just rang her number and she didn't respond. Pretty disrespectful imo. 

We planned to go to a concert in our city during the summer. The event would start at 2pm and end around midnight. X and Z invited me to pregame before going to the concert, and I agreed. I get there and we pregame when I noticed it was around 3pm, so i suggested we go. Z and her friends just ignored me and kept pregaming and watching youtube videos. After it was 5pm, i told X i would be leaving because it was getting late and I would miss some of the acts. He agreed with me and told Z he was leaving. When we meet Z and her friends at the concert venue, it was already 7pm. X had told me he wanted to check out some of the acts i mentioned but Z just made him stick around with her for the night to see what she wanted to see. I just left and did my own thing. 

Yesterday, my buddy back home hung out with X and Z with the premise to pregame and go out, since there was a girl he agreed to meet up with. After waiting 3 hours for Z to get ready, he got frustrated and left X&amp;Z's place. He also said Z was making passive aggressive comments about X for buying an apple watch without running it by her. 

As you can tell by now, X pretty much follows what Z says or does and never criticizes her. He just nods or laughs it up. (i.e. would say something like Oh you know how Z is haha..) Personally, I would find that sort of attitude to be disrespectful, since it's driving X's friends away. When he hang out with X by himself, he's a completely different person. He's great to hang out with and a really good guy.  I can tell in his face he gets frustrated whenever Z pulls these antics.

The issue is that I'm not really a close close friend of X, so i don't know how to point out that A-Z is driving people away from hanging out with them and B - He needs to put his foot down and not agree with her all the time.

17823,Non-Romantic,3huuza,"A bit of background to better understand some of the people involved...

My father won custody of me when I was 4 years old from my mother. That should speak volumes in and of itself about my mother, but to state it further, I do not have much of a relationship with her. I have always been and will always be grateful to my dad for fighting for me. He's never been the best parent- he has many flaws, as we all do, but I've never questioned his unconditional love for me, and I will always love him unconditionally as well.

I should also mention here that my father has always been the impulsive type. He get's all excited about new things and, as a result, has never been that great with finances and financial planning. Of course, a divorce and custody battle doesn't help that, but I don't blame him for that part. Reason I mention this is because, at a young age, I would stress myself out over our money problems- something obviously I had no direct control over. Around high school, it started feeling like our roles were becoming reversed- the child becoming the parent, having to 'restrain' him from making bad financial decisions (say, Dad...maybe we should sell that boat? I know, I love using it also, but it's really expensive to maintain...)

I should also mention my dad remarried when I was 7, but that only lasted approximately one year. She treated me horribly, and he was constantly on the road for work, but when he found out about how she treated me, he confronted her, and they split up. Again- I've never questioned how far my dad would go for me.

When I was 13, he began dating a woman who moved in with us when I was in high school. Typical teenager, I didn't like her- she was quiet and seemingly judgmental in the way that only women from the deep South can be. But by the time I graduated and went to college, I had changed my opinion of her, and told her the day I left that I needed her to watch out for my dad and that I loved her (back to the whole child as the parent thing).

Fast forward to the advent of social media: my dad eventually signs up for facebook, and he becomes that 'crazy uncle at Christmas' character, constantly posting some of the most backwards, offensive, vitriolic things possible. Not to get political, but he's a Trump supporter- that should tell you a lot. That wouldn't be a big deal- its his profile, afterall, except for the fact that he essentially 'friended' everyone of my friends who he had ever met, even passingly. I've repeatedly talked with him about this, trying to be as respectful as possible, and each time he'll stop for a few days...and then start right back up, like he can't help himself. 

It continues to the point where I eventually decide to deactivate my account entirely- I'd rather not be on facebook than have his embarrassing posts slap me in the face (I realize I could have just unsubscribed from his posts). I figure its not something I should get worked up over.

But my friends tell me about some of the stuff he posts. Like posting a blog column (written by someone else) that describes how much better the world would be had the South won the Civil War. Totally cringe-worthy stuff. The other day, my buddy texted me a screenshot of something my dad had posted- an article about the EPA director committing perjury, to which dad included a comment referring to her with a homosexual slur. I immediately text my dad Please refrain from using homosexual slurs on facebook where my friends can see it to which he immediately responds that he will take it down, and apparently he did. So, that's encouraging...he listened! But I know that won't stop him from doing it in the future.

See, my dad is the type who feels like he's fighting the good fight on social media, that he's educating the masses in ways that the 'mainstream media' refuses to do, and anyone who tries to talk sense into him is simply trying to restrict his right to free speech (I know- thats not how this works, 1st amendment is protected from government restriction, not individuals telling you you're acting the fool)

I wouldn't care if it were anyone else- but I dont want to see my dad present himself in this way that I know is offensive to so many people. I try to explain to him how he's inadvertently pushing away friends and family, but he simply says that if they want to disassociate themselves from him for what he sees as speaking the truth, then so be it. Personally, I don't like to see my dad do that to himself. I've even had to go as far as to put the situation in the whole parent-child perspective by telling him that, if he ever came to me aside and told me he believed something I was doing was disrespecting our family name and disappointed him, that that would be enough for me to want to re-evaluate my actions. That seemed to get through to him...for a few days. Eventually he forgets and reverts back. I seriously think he has adult ADD or something similar.

Anyways- why does any of that REALLY matter? Its pretty petty to be concerned with the social media postings of my father, I get that. But there's an additional variable- he has a grandson for the first time. My boy will turn 1 year old in a couple of months. 

Bottom line- I don't want my father's negativity and cynicism to one day be an influence on my son (which is the best way to describe his view of the world: every story has some political ulterior motive that should be distrusted and viewed with negativity and cynicism, no matter how innocuous or positive the story is)

Of course, it gets worse.
I truly do love my stepmother. She has been incredible for my son. She loves him tremendously, and it shows. My stepmother is not the judgmental woman I thought she was when I was a teenager, she's just a deep southern bell with a very quiet demeanor. She's also not the smartest person, and I say that in the least insulting way possible. I don't want to say it, but its the truth, and it leads into the next part.

I've always known my dad is NOT good when it comes to conflict resolution, especially with women. He is distrustful of women, and I can't exactly blame him due to his history with two divorces. So, when the two of them argue, she typically just goes quiet and distances herself from the conversation. She doesn't like to get into a 'battle of words' because she has trouble finding the words to successfully argue her position. My dad, on the other hand, is the argumentative type. He loves a good debate, though he tends to get too heated up too easily to classify himself as being a good debater. When she goes quiet, he just lets her go. He gets upset sometimes, says mean things to her. I don't think he's ever physically abused her, but maybe some of the things he has said to her could be classified as emotionally abusive? I'm not sure.

I know all of this because, when I was out of town for work recently, my stepmother spent a few nights with my wife and son to help my wife while I was gone. My wife told me about everything they talked about- the things my stepmother confided in my wife with. I won't lie- hearing one particular line made me feel 10 feet tall. Apparently, when my dad says something mean or particularly nasty to my stepmother, and she does actually speak up, she 'threatens' him by saying I'm going to go tell [TeamSawyer] what you just said to me! and it tends to get him to shut up, at least for the moment.

Like I mentioned before- my dad also tends to get wound up easily, getting all excited about new ideas, to the point where he does not do a good job of financial planning. He has no retirement (but is self employed, and makes decent money now) and he insists on buying toys rather than investing in his future and/or retirement. I've had several discussions with him about this, and he insists he has a plan, which I won't bore anyone here with anymore than I've already bored so far.

My stepmother, who also had been married previously, told my wife that if they weren't both at their age, and had already been married previously, that she would have left my dad by now. She told my wife that she has repeatedly asked that they try couples counseling but he refuses.

I'm considering approaching his oldest brother, my uncle, to talk with him about this- but I'm not sure if I can go to him in complete confidence. I don't know if my uncle would turn around and talk to my dad before I come up with a plan of how to approach my dad.

Here's my question: how do I approach my dad and get him to take me seriously in regards to A) be more mindful of how he presents himself, both on social media and in person, to avoid living a life of negativity, cynicism, and vitriol, and B) treat my stepmother as a partner on equal footing deserving of the love and respect that he would expect her to show him, while not coming across as someone talking down to him?
   
**tl;dr**: My dad, whom I love unconditionally, has turned into a person I do not like, and it kills me. For the sake of our family, how do I approach him in a loving, respectful, yet effective way?

I am the second of six children. The other 5 were home schooled for some (my older brother, last two years of high school) to all (the younger 4) of their schooling. I was the exception, not home schooled because I was deeply involved with sports. I could have played D1 sports, something homeschooling simply couldn't offer me although if she could have done it again my mother would home school me no doubt. I have nothing against the concept of home schooling in general, but the implementation used within my family is atrocious. EVERY assignment is religious in nature, be it a math problem about the number of books in the bible to a writing assignment about analyzing a passage from Summa Theologica to history through the eyes of a catholic textbook. There is zero separation between education and religion. Again, while I don't approve, this could be put in practice correctly. It isn't. 

My siblings are all doing very poorly in testing and general education level, especially because I KNOW they can do better. They are scoring at a median public-school level on standardized tests while my older brother and I consistently scored in the 99th percentile, took all AP classes, and were both paid to go to prestigious universities. I don't expect my siblings to do exactly the same, but the education they are getting at home is piss-poor and is doing them a major disservice all in the name of religion.

So why are they homeschooled? Because of me. Because I lost my faith. My mother has blamed the education I received on causing me to lose my faith and is making sure she personally educates the rest of the children to ensure they maintain their relationship with god, as she puts it. Even though I went to a Catholic high school, a catholic middle school, it wasn't good enough. She's doing everything she can to prevent my siblings from following in my footsteps, as at her core she is terrified education causes loss of faith. Oh and another thing? They're receiving literally ZERO sexual education. Not even abstinence only. My siblings will graduate with a high school equivalent diploma and not have any idea what sex is, much less how it works and what precautions are necessary. 4 of the last 5 girls to graduate from this homeschooling group my family is a part of have had children out of wedlock, and yet the blame falls on the girls for giving in to sin, not the group for not teaching them any fucking sex ed. But I digress.

I can't abandon my family. I have one younger brother who means the world to me. I have been struggling with depression for almost 6 years now (getting help, that's not the purpose of this post) and he has kept me going through the hardest of times. It hurts me every day watching him live in that environment. I stayed near family for college just to watch him grow up. I do everything I can to stay close to him regardless of what mother dear says to / about me, which is why I just ignore her comments as long as he is still under her control. But I'm reaching a breaking point.

Over the holidays my mother and I had a chance to talk a little bit. I asked why she won't send my younger brother to high school, and she deflected the question. I wouldn't take ignoring it for an answer and kept turning the conversation back. It wasn't for money. It wasn't for transportation. It wasn't for any conceivable material reason. She eventually paused, and said so he won't turn out like you. I knew that was the reason, but fuck, it really hurts to hear from your parents. I left the house and haven't talked to her since then. I don't feel like I can maintain a stable relationship with her any longer, but cutting her off means cutting off my brother as well and that's simply not acceptable. I'm just at a loss for what to do. I know she means well, but she's just misguided and I fear for my siblings' future after being under her management for so long. This post doesn't even scratch the surface of their deficiencies from home schooling, which is another thorn in my side, but that's not the point. I feel my relationship with my mother is no longer salvageable, and it's causing me to spiral downward very quickly back into depression. Thoughts?

tl;dr: Mother is using religion as a weapon, driving a wedge between me and her and indirectly the rest of the family. Don't know how to proceed civilly. I think she's directly harming the future of my siblings in her misguided attempts at education.

Because the show is a big deal, I'm inviting anybody who has ever expressed interest in seeing me perform. Parents, brother, cousins, old friends, coworkers, etc.

It's the first time any of these people have seen me do standup, so they have no idea what kind of material I write.

I come from a religious background. My brother is a pastor, a ton of my old friends are religious and the majority of my coworkers are religious too. One upside is that most of them happen to be the cool kind of religious. Like the I love jesus and I love Kanye West, but I don't agree with Kanye on a morality standpoint, just his dope beats. 

Over the past few years I have transitioned from being very religious to not religious at all, but I haven't told that to any of them publicly(I don't have any religion jokes, so I won't be outing myself on stage, but most of them will probably get the hint).

My material is most definitely rated R. I have jokes that involve oral sex, cum, weed, masturbation, boners, etc. They're not shock-value jokes about that stuff, but my premises include those topics. It's my unfiltered, vulnerable thoughts &amp; jokes.

I'm definitely not known as a person with a filter, so I think everybody might assume how I speak to them at work or in person is the darkest/dirtiest I'll go.

So I know this isn't the normal fodder for r/relationships, but this has been a huge issue within my family and I feel like no one else (that I know of) has ever gone through this.

So my brother, S [24M] has never ever held a job in his life, he's graduated high-school, but he's never been to a trade school, or college, or university. He spends his time trading video games at EB, buying video games and playing video games all day. He also lives in my parent's basement (rent free of course), and that's his entire existence. The only time he ever goes outside is to trade video games at EB or indie game stores. 

My parents are very frustrated because they do everything for S. They let him live in the basement rent-free, they make food for him, and my Mom still does his laundry for him. They also constantly have to drive him around all over town in order for him to trade games at stores because he doesn't have his driver's license (he doesn't even have his G1 license) and he refuses to take the bus. He refuses to get a job, apply to some form of tertiary education, and get his driver's license and get a life. Every time my parents attempt to make him do something on his own (for example, take the bus somewhere) he throws a temper tantrum and he'll scream and cry and throw things or punch holes in walls until he gets his own way.

You're probably wondering why he's like this. Well, I don't have enough room or time to put it here, but from what I do know and what I can mention, my brother has a very poor bowel control and he has a severe learning disability (there's no official diagnosis that was given to my family but from what my friends have told me, he has some form of autism) which made his life a living hell from elementary school all the way up to high-school. He was severely bullied by both teachers and students in elementary school and high-school because he smelled like shit (literally) and he was socially awkward with a severe learning disability. So not only was he severely bullied, but he got poor grades on a regular basis which lead him to constantly skip classes and eventually get suspended. After he was branded as a flight risk by the school administrators (they told him he was going to flunk out of high-school) he dropped out of high-school at 16 years old because he couldn't take the bullying anymore, not to mention that the teachers and school administrators had told him he was a failure. However, he went back at 18 years old to get his high-school diploma and he did get it, but he now refuses to do anything with it.  

You're probably wondering why my parents refuse to kick him out of the house. Well, it's because he would just come back to the house and throw a tantrum until my parents let him back in.

Anyways, it's been 7 years since my brother got his diploma and he has still yet to get a job or go to college like he said he would. My parents are sick of him wasting his life away in the basement playing video games all day, and they want him to get a job OR go to college like he said he would.

Have any other redditors been through this situation and successfully gotten out of it? If so, please comment or PM me, my family is desperate for my brother to get a life...otherwise my only other option will be to write to the Dr.Phil show and see if he can do anything about it.

To keep it short, almost exactly two years ago(21.5.2012), I sent an e-mail to my mother that I've been thinking about not having any contact with her again. She replied to my e-mail with some talk about her own mother and the words I will never ever forget: Yeah, I've been thinking the same. One month later my father moves abroad because of work, two months after that my brother has to go with him(minor with diabetes and my father didn't want him to stay here, plus my brother needed a new start). I was 18 at the time. My step mother didn't go with him since she has children and grandchildren here, but they didn't separate. I started drinking again and treating my ex really bad.


After my family left, my stepmother got a new side to herself. She had never taken the roll of a mother, which we all agree is a good thing. But everything has to be spot on clean and if I leave a dirty pot or something in the sink, she starts screaming. Once she threw a water tank from a dryer, because I forgot to empty it. If I threw a small party for my friends and I'd clean up the house, put the empty cans in a plastic bag outside the front door, she would flip out. I admit in the beginning I didn't care too much but I started to try harder, I really did. Of course it was never enough.


Yesterday I came home from a trip abroad. I happily sighed when I saw that she wasn't home(in the summer she usually goes to our summer cottage). Invited friends over for some pre-bar party(we were no more than 7 people and they are my best friends). Cleaned up everything perfectly. Today I made some rice to eat and I left some in the pot since I've been raised with not putting hot food into the fridge(not sure if it's true but it's a habit). While it's still hot, she comes home and directly start screaming about that it's time for me to move out and that I always leave stuff behind me. 5 minutes later, she bangs the door and goes away some where. When she comes home in the evening, she goes to her room and calls my father and directly starts crying about that she feels like I'm leaving stuff on purpose and I want her to feel bad and that it feels like I'm shitting on her. I call up my dad and I say that she is lying and that I've cleaned up everything but the hot rice in the pot. My father is a good father, but not in any way a good male figure for me or my brother. He starts going on asking if I hate women above the age of 50, since my brother never had any problems with my mother, stepmother and grandmother(all of which he has had problems with). I replied that we react differently to things, since I can't break my brother and mine secrets. I calmed down and said that it's absurd that he thinks that I hate women about 50 and say how could I manage school, since almost every teacher is a woman to which he answers well you obviously didn't. Plus my psychologists is a woman over 50. He even said that soon I might not even have one parent. I went completely quiet.


Sorry that it's so long and I don't even know if this belongs here but I've been to therapy for a year or so and talking with a psychologist since I was about 15-16. I keep drinking alcohol and eating to keep the pain away, which is exactly what my father did when he and mother broke up. My step mother is moving to the summer cottage at least until we sell the house.
 
My two other replies in the thread:

I talked to my father today and he said that soon I might not have any parents left any more, if I continue like this. I'm looking for an apartment and a job since I am still financially dependent on my father. I'm starting to think I've been blaming my mum for too much of the problems in my childhood. Sadly, that doesn't still make her my mother.

We have these kind of fights maybe once a month and it always ends with please clean it up, I don't want you to fight or please do it for me with that tone that means that I'm childish and that I should know better. And he is never wrong either! When he told something when we were younger and we corrected him, he said the never said and starts changing subject.

When I say that I miss them, I actually miss my brother. Me and him are very different. He is skilled in maths and chemistry, while I'm very good at psychology but that was never okay when I was younger. I absolutely loved reading history with my grandfather when I was little. I took a lot of lessons in school and read many books but my passion for it was destroyed when I heard you can keep it up as a hobby, but you will never get a job with history. My brothers skills where always much much better and appreciated. I love him to death, but I always envied the subjects he was good at and never appreciated my own.

I try to get out as much as I can. I even spend time in a school when I don't need it. When I'm home I try to be in my room with my door closed.

Without going into any details, she's the kind of person that argues to the death and always wants to have the last say. It runs in the family (I am guilty of that too). Although I give her fair and relatively calm warnings when I'm about to lose my temper, she ignores them completely and continues to push and dig deeper into an already stupid fight.

Today I lost my temper and yelled in her face. She yelled back. It was a very heated exchange. I told her to get out of my apartment. I just came back from work and did not need the fighting and being yelled at. She said she would remember this for the rest of her life and told me to mark this day when she has a house and kicks me out of it. She never left and continued yelling at me. My arguments were centered on how awful she treats me and how ungrateful she is to me for what I do for her, which she turns back against me and uses arguments like these when I lose my temper to point out that I treat her badly as well/ At this point I take my already distraught mother and leave the apartment because I couldn't stand being inside with her. 

She prevents me from leaving. She told me she wanted to be in the car with her and promised to shut up while inside. However, her presence and the fight still bothered me and I told her she couldn't go. I tried to close the door to the apartment and she kept pulling it back to prevent me from leaving. I pulled rather forcefully and she snapped at me and said I hurt her and to remember and mark this moment.

I really don't want to get into any details because I am planning on showing her this post and don't want her to dismiss people's responses as pandering to my biased account of the fight.

Questions:

1. Am I, a legal tenant of the apartment, perfectly within my rights to ask her to leave the apartment when she is causing me grief? She said I had no right to kick family out, which may be a cultural thing, but it's not like she follows any of our cultural norms about respect either (we're Asian), so I'm throwing any cultural arguments in her favor out the window. Also it's not like I'm kicking her out forever.

2. As for being an older brother, I really do try to be calm and supportive most of the time. The times are very few and far between, but when she provokes me she sure knows how to provoke and drive me up the wall. Then she acts hurt and surprised that I reacted that way and says I'm out of control (which I am! because she incessantly provoked me! for the record I have never had the displeasure of fighting like this or being provoked like this with any other human being on the planet). How far should my patience really stretch?

17883,Non-Romantic,3idvvw,"Recently I was asked to cosign a car loan for my Aunt who is 75 years old. She was recently, within the last couple of years, left by her husband. She now receives social security payments and supposedly will be getting additional money from her ex husband per month again. She has no job, current car, or retirement savings that I'm aware of. She wants a car to be able to get around and do things. Is she in dire *need* of a car? Probably not.

So I'm going to break here and say that I was originally going to post this to /r/personalfinance, but I believe I'm aware of what impact it is going to have on me financially. I still might post it(?). I think I'm more concerned about reasons why I'm being asked to do so than the actual financial reasons and because what the hell, here's the rundown of my finances:

I have good credit. Like 750-780 from credit scores.

I make slightly over $40,000 a year.

I have some credit card bills piled up to about $2,000 because of some very recent medical bills and car repairs, but have already laid out a plan to pay them off.

I have $4,000 in a used car loan already on my name which will be paid off by tax refund time next year.

I had been planning to buy a new motorcycle soon, possibly on loan, Probably not until I save up for it cash.

So the story goes, I've been asked by my mother to cosign this loan for my aunt. My mother said she would have done it already, but her credit isn't good enough. What I take from that is that is her and my step-father's credit isn't good enough to get an interest rate like I could, lowest being 2.99% on a used car, not that they couldn't do it at all. Or even my aunt couldn't do it at all. My parents have a mortgage, 1 car payment, and I believe that's all I'm aware of concerning their debt. Before myself or my parents were even considered for this endeavor, it's worth noting that my aunt has 6 daughters. 2 of which I know just aren't in a position to help their mother get a car. 3 of the others are married, 2 of which's husbands have excellent jobs where the wives didn't have to work for years unless they wanted to. The other I don't really know much about. I'm sure that family is doing ok. The last daughter (Becky) was actually living in the house that my aunt and uncle were splitting the mortgage with. I'm going to say that I don't know ANY other information as to why none of these daughters are not helping. Maybe because my aunt is 75 and had a stroke last year and they don't want their mother having that kind of driving freedom. I don't know. She is aloud to borrow someone's car when she needs to so there's that, but it can't be done often as there are only two cars where she is living now and both of them get used all day and night for work.

I don't know what the story is with any of the other daughters, but Becky was, like I mentioned, living in the house splitting the mortgage to what percentage I do not know. 50/50? Thirds? I don't know. The house was getting paid for by all of them up until two years ago when my uncle split. My uncle sent money to my aunt for a while but then it stopped and the Becky took on the payments by herself for about a year and a half. The youngest daughter moved in at this time with her husband and were paying, I believe $800 a month rent, to live there for a year and a half. I don't know how much of the mortgage that relates to.

The house was recently sold and this is where that blurb about Becky, not to put her on blast specifically because I'm sure the others have money saved up, gets relevant. There was a $26,000 profit and my aunt was given $1,000. Because of this I'm assuming the house had always been in just Becky's name. She has an excellent job as a nurse and gets paid well and I'm assuming at the time had excellent credit to be able to do that. I'm just sort of curious how the house was getting paid for in a group sense for 9 years or something, then the last two being covered by herself entitles her to to ~97% of the profit? I guess on paper, legally, it seems to be that way but that's your mom?! I guess that's why I'm posting in /r/relationships. I can't begin to calculate any napkin math because I don't know the specifics like the mortgage payment so I don't know if that's fair for her to keep that or not.

After all that information, it has been proposed to me to go something like this: I go through my bank to apply for the loan myself. Go buy a used car with my name and my aunts name on the title. My aunt insures it under her own plan and pays me money for the loan from her social security. In the event of any financial distress, my mother assures me she will pay me the money if my aunt can't for whatever reason.

Assurances aren't legally withstanding and if I were to go through with this I would be taking a key for myself and in the event of anything happening I would be repo'ing the car myself and selling it.

I guess the point of this is I'm a little annoyed that this has basically fallen through, at the least, 5 levels of people that should really be doing it before it has come to me to do this. I don't believe I'm really in the kind of position to be able to help someone out and take care of my own life comfortably. At least not when I'm looking at 5 families making more than $100,000. I'm also not liking how I am now feeling guilty on my own accord, not being guilt tripped by anyone, that I want to buy a new motorcycle and this is probably going to affect that in some way. Not that I'm going be paying for the car in a good scenario, but that the loan is going to hit MY credit and I'm going to be on the hook, legally for the money. I feel like 4 daughters could chip in some money and all get their mother a car, but whatever.

I wouldn't feel bad helping this woman out who has been nothing by nice to me my entire life, it's just that I have to be doing it when others can that makes me upset. I'm also thinking about the fact that this is not *my mother* and maybe I should leave this alone, despite what my own mother is asking of me. This could very well just be what her daughters want to be happening. It's not like she needs her own car.

She was shocked and said her if she can elaborate. The coach said it's not your fault honey, when you don't have a mother figure shit like this happens.

I don't know how I should approach this issue. Any help is much appreciated.

17886,Non-Romantic,3e8wrh,"I've known Marie since we were 18, she was my roommate in our freshman dorm.  She has always been one of the smartest people I know, she's driven, pragmatic and no bullshit, and she has been such a good friend to me.  Maybe relevant BG on Marie:  She did undergrad with a near-perfect GPA (like 3.9 something) with a double major in two different sciences.  She was president of our sorority.  She worked 40 hours a week as a vet tech starting our junior year.  She was engaged two years ago, the guy turned out to be a man-child who was seriously emotionally retarded.  She had the courage to walk away for which I give her so much credit - she wants kids yesterday and seems to have the worst luck in romantic relationships.  For example, she got pregnant the first time she ever had sex (19) and the guy immediately dumped her and reneged on promises to pay for half of the abortion.  The guy she dated after dumping her fiance turned out to be married and threatened to kill her if she told his wife.  Stuff like that.  Despite all this, Marie has been very successful career-wise.  I am in awe of her in many ways.

Marie is a vet, and when I say vet, she's not your standard vaccinate/spay/neuter vet (not that there's anything wrong with that!)  She's an internal medicine vet that works at a very prestigious animal hospital in a large, wealthy city.  She is the tits at her job.  Her bosses love her, her patients love her, she's like fucking James Herriot.  The problem is that she has tried and failed twice to pass her boards.  She took them for a third time in June and she's been slowly getting more and more freaked out as the August results approach that she's going to fail again.  Marie tends to freak out a lot about exams and formal assessments, I remember her staying up night after night in college studying for o-chem and other difficult classes.  In a practical application of those skills, her anxiety disappears and she's ultra-confident and competent.  Ask her to write an essay about it and it's cause for a freakout.  Obviously she got through vet school just fine but this board certification is causing her so much strife.  Not just the mental aspect but the cost - it's like $1000 to take that test.  

---

So I'm worried that she's going to fail a third time.  I know what I'm going to do if she passes, it'll be an epic celebration, but I just don't know how to help if she fails again.  I've suggested prep classes, tried to go over study strategies with her, but I'm out of my depth in terms of knowing how to prepare for something like this.  Telling her how great/smart/capable she is is what I've been doing, trying to build up her confidence prior to the test and build her up again after her two failures, but I just don't know how to do better.  I know I can't FIX IT for her, but what else can I do here?

17915,Non-Romantic,2r0t7e,"Okay, a little background first. We live in quite a reserved nation. My parents, though open minded, are a little conservative with respect to relationships. They're okay with relationships which they know of, but would not like anyone to do it behind their backs. For e.g. They never questioned me, who is in grad school with whom I associate with, because, well, I was already good with my academics. My sister, though intelligent, had taken a fall in grades which we considered to be just a phase in her life. She entered high school this year. We gifted her a mobile phone, and she was very enthusiastic about it. Like an other enthusiastic teenager, she started using IM.

Fast forward a couple of months later, I discover some text messages with a male 'friend' of hers. I was very concerned about the texting habits she had during that time.  I knew she chat on a number of IM's, and was trustful of how she could handle it. Whenever, she texted, and we were around her, she put her phone away. She'd usually keep her mobile phone locked with a password. But one day, she got unlucky and I saw the messages. Fearing reprimand for her from our parents, I confronted her privately about the texts she had sent. I warned about the nature of our parents, who would have been okay if she'd been doing that until after she became an adult. I trusted her to do the needful, and told her to discontinue it. I also explained her that she should instead concentrate on her studies, achieve something in life, and then do these things. She replied in the affirmative. 

Another couple of months later, our parents found out about the affair, with other text messages having more suggestive content than what I had found. I had a calm talk with my parents, explaining that it was just the hormones raging in the teenage years, and they said they understood that. They then sent me the proof of the messages, with they not sending the half of it, because they couldn't bear to show it to me. It had some things which a 16 (then 15) year old shouldn't have been doing. They weren't explicit/adult in nature, but we weren't sure if my sister had just deleted them or not. When asked for an explanation, she didn't offer any, and just cried. We also found that the thing had been going on for more than a year(when she didn't have a phone), and it probably was the reason of her falling grades. Boy, it was a stressful time for all of us. I, again explained her about the nature of most boys, and warned her the last time on my trust. I told her that people in her age ought to learn something new, and think about the future. Needless to say she lost her phone that day. I and my parents thought it would be best not to drag around these troubles, and we ended it at that. Keep in mind we live in a nation which is quite women unsafe in the public, so we wanted her not to be taken advantage of. Never was the matter mentioned again.

Another couple of months later, parents gifted her a new phone on her birthday letting bygones be bygones. As I said, my parents are great, fulfilling everything we may need. My father thought that she'd feel sorry about the loss of her phone when she saw her friends' phones. Hence, we gifted her that. A couple of days ago, we found about the call she'd been making to the same guy as before. She'd been making calls at night, when we were all sleeping, and even that would have been undiscovered if it weren't been for my younger brother waking up in the middle of the night. When confronted, she again went into her cry mode, not uttering so much as a word. She ruined the New Year for us.

She's just 16!
We are incredibly stressed out about this, and don't know what to do.

17959,Non-Romantic,1yba58,"I am married to a wonderful man, have a fantastic little boy, and am about to pop with twins. However, I also have a baby-daddy (a term I never use, usually it is Flynn's dad, or your daddy, but it does convey our relationship- he is not an ex) in the mix.

Flynn is the product of a one-night stand with a friend's roommate. The friend's roommate was extremely immature, bit of a pothead, waited tables when he showed up and was hoping to become a rockstar. I honestly thought he wouldn't step up... but was pleasantly surprised when he said that he planned to be an involved dad.

Now from the start, his idea of involved has been the cool stuff (ones plastered with 90s cartoon heroes/dinosaurs, mini shoes like his, writing a rock ballad composed to him..) versus the more responsible stuff (going to labor class, reading books on development, researching car seats, paying for baby things). But he does love Flynn. Everytime I get frustrated I try and remember that not only is he crazy about that little boy, that my son feels the same way. BUT, we are getting to a point we are about to have issues.

Some ongoing issues, he cited in my inconsideration over the big issue I'll get to last:
1.) He brings him back a wreck- his clothes waded up in his bag, sometimes his teeth unbrushed, unshowered. A few weeks ago, he dropped him off covered in mud. Oh, we decided to jump in puddles, wasn't it fun? Well, not only did we have somewhere to be (a family party that he knew about) but he also demolished his shoes. I texted him asking to bring him home not filthy and he said we were being boys, don't be a clean freak. I am far from a clean freak, I know kids have fun and need to get messy-- I don't dress him in Armani. He wears hand-me downs and clothes from Ross and Target. But this is an ongoing issue (a few months ago he got nice clothes stained with paint ((I buy most 90% of Flynn's clothes)) and acted the same way.

2.) He doesn't respect bedtimes or any schedules. He says that he gets him so rarely (which isn't entirely fair, he gets him quite often, even if only to go to the park during the week) overnight that bedtimes shouldn't matter. Well, when I pick up my four year old at 8am who went to bed at 4 and got up at 7, it ruins both of our days! He gets him overnight once every other week usually (due to his work schedule, not me refusing access).

3.) I buy him too much and too many nice things to show him up. Admittedly, we have more money than he does, but I never buy my son things to spite him. I buy my son things because he is my son. We got a trampoline at Christmas and my son was excited and told his dad how much fun he and Taddy-his stepfather- had. That enraged him. Similarly, we went on a trip to disney world before we started trying for a baby. We wanted to do something special just the three of us before we had a new little person around. He said it was unfair to bring flynn because he could never afford to bring him..

4.) FINALLY, the issue that has brought all our past grudges up, I want to put Flynn in preschool a few days a week for half days. He just turned four and I always planned on it,but the new baby(now babies) made me decided to keep him a little longer and work with getting him excited. I think he needs the socialization and would be a good outlet with the new babies, let him be the big boy.But his dad is throwing a fit. I am trying to steal his time, give his son to strangers to spite him. 

I told him that it didn't have to effect his days. He could have him on days when he doesn't go in or in the mornings for those hours. He said his work schedule is too irregular and threatened to bring me to court to keep my son out of preschool, so he can the ability to have him at his whim.

I think Flynn is a person who needs to start exploring the world/spending time with other kids. What does his dad think will happen in a year and a half when Flynn starts k-5? He is thinking of Flynn as property, as his buddy.

I think he is being selfish, he think I am. Anyone want to help me see his side?

Over the past 2 years, I made a lot of positive changes to my appearance. I've lost weight, grown out my hair, and started dressing much nicer. I have a boyfriend 45/M that I have been with for 2 years, and Mr. B knows this.

Since the summer, Mr. B has become very flirtatious with me and started emailing me and texting my personal cell phone number, sometimes late at night. Nothing crude, just conversational stuff. At first (and this is me being an idiot) I kindof enjoyed the attention. Having lost a ton of weight- I was not used to being flirted with. He's a very nice, good looking, powerful man (with a long term GF who also works here, I should add). I responded to his texts and emails in a friendly manner, and was not inappropriate or anything. There have been a few instances where he has given me a ride home from work- he lives close to me. The last time he gave me a ride home, he leaned in like he was going to kiss me. I pulled away, said thank you and goodnight. I thought he got the point that I was not interested. I was wrong. He kept offering me rides. I said no. He kept emailing and texting, I only responded when it is work related. 

Finally, a few days ago he offered me another ride home. Again, I told him no. This time however- I told him that I won't be accepting anymore rides from him because my boyfriend is a very jealous man and is not comfortable with us hanging out or texting outside of work. This is true- my boyfriend doesn't like it. But more importantly, I'm just am not interested in Mr. B like that. I didn't want to flat out say that though, I thought it might hurt his ego or something.

So I thought that me spelling this out for Mr. B would make him stop making advances. I was wrong. Yesterday he asked me out for drinks. Then he called me. This is really getting old.

I should add that he is the head of HR.

At what point does this become harassment? I think there are people that I could go to about this- but I am hesitant. He is friends/friendly with all of the other execs. Everything that he has emailed or texted has been relatively benign, friendly stuff- just a lot of it. Nothing crude or inappropriate. He does often comment on my appearance, but only in person and out of the earshot of others.

Backstory:

So I’m sixteen and there’s a knock on the door of my high school german classroom.  It’s the principal.  He walks me down to the library where my mother works.  She’s sobbing on the floor with my older brother’s hand on her shoulder.  My dad had left a suicide note on the kitchen counter. My brother is the one who found it.  It’s his birthday.  

Anyway.  Turns out he chugged a bottle of Lorazepam and brought his old police revolver and a shotgun with him to a local state park.  He laid a sleeping bag out beneath a tree there, right on top of a hill.  He’s found by a man on his lunch break.  My father had fallen down the hill and cracked his skull on a rock at the base.  

So here we are again, me and my mother and my brother, standing in my high school library.  I have another sister, but she’s not here yet.  

She meets us at the hospital later.

My dad is in a coma.  He likely won’t survive.

Another thing you should know about my dad-- after leaving the police force at the behest of my mother, he became a respiratory therapist.  He made us all swear to him, repeatedly, never to allow him to be on life support.  

After meeting with the hospital ethics committee, a consensus is reached and we ‘pull the plug,’ so to speak.

He survives.

He remembers nothing of the previous five years and refuses to believe he would ever commit such an act.  In his mind, it was all some plot of my mother’s to get rid of him.  

My mom is the sweetest little librarian you’ll ever meet.  Her idea of a good time is cross-stitch and PBS.  She’s no diabolical villain, is all I’m trying to say here. 

Now let’s flash forward:

My dad is living in an apartment with this filipino woman he met online.  They get married, have a kid (my dad is 65 and she is 30, for a clear picture).  He and my mom don’t speak, but my siblings and I visit when we can.  Mainly me.  My brother, Dave, is in the military and my sister, Wendy, is forever angry with my father for what he did but doesn’t remember.

They move to the Philippines with their baby girl.

My dad and I facetime.  He emails Wendy.  Wendy never emails back.  

They bring out the worst in one another, you have to see.  Wendy can’t get over the past.  And there is a past.

I guess my dad went crazy when I was around twelve.  At least that’s when I clocked out.  I hit the seventh grade and realized my father was unhealthy and unwilling to change and that I was too young to be so cognizant so I ignored and repressed.  I don’t think we shared more than ‘hello’ and ‘good-bye’ for the next four years.

Not so with my sister.  She’s eleven years my senior and I suspect that his role as a father figure had more time to cure with her.  He continued to pay her car payments while she was in grad school, and her credit card and tuition and what-have-you.  But then he stopped.  Not all together, but slowly, over time.  Never telling her.  Ruining her credit.  Shit like that.

He was seeing a couple women he met at work and spending too much money on them.  Helping their families, you know, shit like that.  He has this insatiable need to be needed.  I guess my sister didn’t appreciate him enough.  So he went elsewhere.  Obviously, no one knew this at the time.  This was only after what we refer to as his ‘accident,’ when my brother and I listened to his voicemail. 

He always refused to see a therapist or psychiatrist.  Even left his general practitioner of 15 years because he refused to see my dad unless he got a psych evaluation.  My dad found some harvard med alum who would write a script for whatever he played at having.  He dropped out of medical school in his third year, so he could fake illnesses very well.  Got whatever drugs he wanted and took them together without a care.  

There was other garbage could constitute a ‘past,’ but nothing worth mentioning.  I’m just gonna throw under the umbrella of mild mental abuse.  Standard manipulation.  Kind of his forte, actually.  He came from a very impoverished family and often had to con his way to his next meal as a kid.  Being a homicide detective really nourished that trait though, I guess that’s worth mentioning.

But back to Wendy. 

She stopped emailing him and our dad flipped shit.  Started sending some very nasty letters that basically just said she’s worthless.

Everyone around her told her to just cut him out of her life but she couldn’t, she had to know more.  What does he really think of her.  ‘If my own father thinks this, it must be true’ bullshit.  

So basically, my sister lands herself in an inpatient psychiatric facility after attempting suicide.  All with the intent of making our father suffer the same pain he inflicted on us.  A last shot at making him understand.  

She’s out now, but still all jacked up in the head.  PTSD, they say.  Not all from my dad, but most. 

Our dad knows none of this. 

Everyone in my family is trying to force me and my brother to cut ties with our dad.

I’m fine with this.  I really don’t care one way or the other.  But my brother does.  He loves our dad.  They’re best buds.  Dave knows he’s crazy but thinks he can handle it.

The thing is, I know Dave can’t handle it.  He thinks he’s this tough military guy who has no feelings but Dave is my best friend and I know better.  

My dad may be broken but he’s the same.  He’s still manipulative and he still resents that his hold on us as a family was taken from him.  That’s why he fucked with my sister. To assert control.

Now, I don’t want my brother to be the sole person in contact with our father because I know that he will attempt to manipulate us through him.  I also don’t want to hurt my sister by maintaining contact and essentially downplaying everything he did to her. 

So, Reddit, do I stay in touch with my Dad for the sake of my brother or do I cut ties and hope for the best?

17969,Non-Romantic,2tpcli,"I'm sorry for the long wall of text. 
It was essential for me to share some details in order to let you know the dynamics of the relationships mentioned in this post..

So, we are the best of friends since 6 years. We'd been with each other through all thick and thins, poor health of parents, family issues, personal issues, my breakup with my ex, we talked almost everyday all stupid shit that friends do including long drives, first drinks, yada yada yada.

I had a crush on him before we started our friendship. but in a little while into my frienship, i realised that it was not his characters that i wanted in my long term partner. we stayed friends and became best friends over time.

4 years ago, i met my current boyfriend, the most amazing man in the while world!
 Although he initially had some problems with my friendship with A, it resolved by time and my efforts to tell my bf that it was not at all A-like that i wanted my partner to be. 

A always told me that he wanted to have a casual girlfriend just to have a feel of what being in a relation feels like. 
Fast forward to 1.5 years ago, when he texts the hottest girl in his class, J.

 and she replies back!
But things are very sad for him, because she is already in a long term, long distance relationship where she has already talked to her elder brother about marrying this guy. 

In 2 months, she starts going out with A and cheats on her boyfriend. I ask A to break up with this girl because this is not the kind of a girl that i want my best friend to be in a relationship with. J tells A that she has almost already broken up with her boyfriend as he doesnt keep her happy and shit. 
I specifically remember very clearly when A told me that she was spending the night with her bf. I expected her to come clean then and there. But I was a fool for even thinking that she would do the right thing here. they were still together. At this point, I had given up on him, and i had actually become fine with her. if he wants to live with her, what do i have a say in his life, right?

In the next 2 months, A asks her to become his girlfriend officially and she whole heartedly agrees. She breaks up with his previous boyfriend and cuts him out of her life out-right.

This was just 6 months into their first meeting and that night A told me that J was above me as far his priorities were to be considered.
I cant say that I wasn't hurt.

Now starts the trouble. 
A starts finding problems with J.
Her being reckless, going out drinking with a male friend who she knew had a crush on him. (we live in a relatively conservative society where parents are not supposed to know that their daughters drink)
She starts talking to a male senior who is very flirtatious with her and she makes no effort to stop him on her own.
She wants to spend 24 x 7 with A, he wants space, she gives none.
After college, they spend their time together, go to their respective hostels and start talking on the phone until one of them falls asleep.
A liked this in the beginning but after a few days, the lack of space started to crush him. i advised him to talk politely and try for a 2 hours no contact me time. She resisted.
Into the drain went A's hobby of playing fifa games, time to spend alone think, or whatever things guys do.
I advised him to get her into a hobby or something, but turns out she has no hobbies. 
He bought her 2 goldfish as pets. she couldnt take care of them and they died.
He bought her calligraphy books because she had mentioned that she liked calligraphy in school. but like everything, the books hardly crossed page 3.
He bought her white paper and board to paint because apparently, she painted in school. the board never bore anything fruitful.
He wanted to go out with his guy-friends. she tagged along.
Basically, she wanted to spend every living second together and didnt let him do anything he wanted to do on his own.

They started fighting. Have said the meanest things to each other. She has once said something very very outrageous to him during one of these fights and absolutely refused to apologise. 
Since A and I used to talk on the phone quite a bit (we live in different cities since the past 5.5 years and meet twice/thrice an year), she didnt let him talk to me. soon, it started to become Its her or me. A fought with her. Sometimes, she would budge, sometimes she wouldn't. 

This started causing me and A to fight. I was angry at how he let her decide if A and I should talk on a specific day or not. If his phone was busy, she would throw a major temper tantrum and would fight. Eventually, A and I were reduced to one call per week.
Even then, she would have a problem.

A few months ago, I had a plan to visit A's city. We made plans to spend a day with each other, INCLUDING J. She refused to be a part of the plan. we knew if she wouldn't be the part of the plan, A would not be meeting me. we made whatsapp group to convince her but it all failed. I cancelled my visit.

He fought with her on this. she refused to change her attitude about this and told him and I quote Are you guys some sort of special best friends that you need to talk to each other and keep each other updated about what's going on in your life?
Once, they were having a fight about me which I didn't know about and she texts me to sort over everything (Her first attempt ever)
I was very angry with her. I was not at all rude to her but I didn't go all hugs and kisses with her. I told her we'll do it for poor A's sake.
but apparently, i was very rude to her. so A asked me to apologise to J. I after fighting with him swallowed my pride and apologised but that was not enough for her. That was the time when I came to know that things will never be smooth between J and me. because of her treatment of him, and because of her attitude towards me.


Eventually, A and I stopped talking. He told me not to text him when I know what J would be with him (essentially 9am-10pm, sometimes more when they spend the night together)

The day before, he texted me during classes that he just signed up for and i refused to talk to him behind J's back. I thought that it made me feel like it is me who needs to hide from J, as if I'm the one cheating on somebody. He didnt reply back.


I texted her Thanks a lot in the morning out of anger and frustration. She called back demanding to know why i sent that. i apologised and she put the phone down. I told him what stupidity I just did and told him This is probably my last conversation with you two love birds 
stoooooopid, i know. :(

Also, he has tried to break-up with her atleast 4 times in the past, ignores her, doesnt attend her calls/replies back, she starts crying badly, threatening to kill herself etcetra and eventually he takes her back. This has also led to a very dramatic but evidently fake suicide attempt from her.

Now, where do I go from here? 
Whom should I be angry on? Is it her fault? or girls are just jealous like this and I should have been more understanding and gotten out of his life on my own? Is it his fault for submitting so much to an absolute-nutcase and essentially a woman with no hobbies and no passion for anything in life?
Since now i've probably cut ties with them both, how do i mend my heart and fill the void that he left in my life?

I realise that I have used some foul language here. I am very sorry for that. i'm taking a little bit of my anger out here. Somebody please give me some insight.

Since then, they have reconciled. None of us wants anything to do with the man or to offer any endorsement of this reconciliation.

A lot of the problem comes from my ex's mother. Her mother believes in an absolute matriarchal family system. My ex could never manage it (thankfully it only took me 7 years to get out of that situation) so eventually she ended up moving in with her parents which is when it got worse and gets worse every day. 

In the years since the divorce my son would randomly tell me things like:

Women are in charge.

Man's job to do outside work. That he'll (my son) have to live with his mother forever so he can mow her lawn since she's a woman and it isn't her job. 

That women can't change a car tire because it's a man's job (that came after a story about his mother and him being on the side of the road for hours with a flat tire and her ranting because no man would stop).

He was being a bit rough with one of them so my girlfriend stopped the dog and put him up. 

My son says that the dog is just hunting. It's in their nature. Blah blah blah. Which if it stopped there it would be fine. 

But he continued that he (my son) knows something about females of any species including humans. That it's their job to sit at home at cook and clean and do nothing else. And that's the way God made them. 

My girlfriend is a strong independent woman. Hell she's better at cars than me. And loves working hard. 

So is there anything I can tell my son or can I only lead by example?

17981,Non-Romantic,1tgdh1,"My dad and I have, generally had a pretty good relationship, though I guess that needs a bit of qualifying...

My dad is a bit of a bully, no a huge bully. He's arrogant, closed minded and takes no responsibility for his actions. If I go along with him and say what he wants to hear, then we have a pretty good relationship. The minute I speak up that, generally, all turns to shit.

For a few examples, when I was growing up, I lived with my dad and my mum paid child support. My dad didn't think she paid enough child support and often badgered, nagged, bullied and yelled at me until I agreed to do what he wanted, which, most times was to ask my mum for more money (a question that was always met with a very firm no). My childhood was a see saw of get him/her to pay for it at which I was always the loser. 

(I just want to add here that there are obviously really good things about him, too, he's always there if I need him, always helped me, supported and often encouraged me. He is generally very loyal and will often go out of his way to do nice things for me)

Two months ago we went out to dinner, at which he thought it was appropriate to tell me that children should be seen and not heard, and as I am a child I do not have the right to speak... (No I didn't get the age wrong in the title, I'm 28 years old). Obviously I said back that I consider myself an adult and would like it if he didn't say such disrespectful things. It didn't end well and we didn't talk for over a week until my step mother invited me to dinner and he acted like it didn't happen.

So now, he and my stepmother (48/f) have invested in a $750,000 property and borrowed the bulk of it, which they now have to repay and are struggling. They currently live in a 2 bed room house with my step sister (18/f) who just finished high school and will be attending university in the new year. My dad has just now started the same money badgering that he used to do to me, on my stepmother, about having my stepsisters biological father pay more money for her. 

Her father (who lives overseas) just gave her a fair bit of money as a graduation present, and my father is of the opinion that that money should be given to him, because he is the one who is paying for my step sister. 

I am disgusted with him that he would even suggest taking that money from her and have told him as much. This has since triggered him to ask ME for the money as he said he doesn't care who pays for her, but it's not going to be him. Seeing as I have taken a different opinion to his, and voiced my belief that he is being selfish, unreasonable, and petty he has since disowned me and told me to never contact him again. Him saying this kind of thing is fairly regular, though I have not ever told him I do not support him when he was fighting with someone else before, and he can usually be really vindictive when people that he thinks should stand up FOR him no matter what fail to do so.

So now I just feel like I'm in a really shitty situation and I don't know what I should do. On one hand I LOVE my stepmother and stepsister, and am scared she is going to divorce my dad because of this (she called me in tears the other day because of the things he's said to her about this and about her daughter). On the other hand he's my father and I hate the thought that he might end up alone. My mum wasn't the best mother either and he was, for a lot of the time, all I had. I worry that now while they're together my stepmother will appreciate me trying to talk to him and stand up for her, but I also worry that if they split up, she may not be interested in pursuing a relationship with me, and then I'll be left with pretty much no family (my mother lives in a different country and I don't see her much). So, I don't know, I'm hoping that someone can suggest some reasonable advice or, I don't know, have a helpful opinion or something...

**TL;DR** My dad is destroying his marriage by acting as if my young step sister (his step daughter) owes him money and should give him the money her father gave her for her graduation. When I told him I think he's being unreasonable, he disowned me.

17985,Non-Romantic,25lwx3,"Want to clarify we are not and probably will never be in a relationship. The story is however, she's been obsessed with a mentally abusive online boyfriend for the past eight years and she feels like this might finally be the last straw and end her relationship with him. However, she sees herself as someone who's failed everything in life (which is really hard for me to refute because school and things) and she doesn't want to give up on this one guy that she loves even though he's been awful to her because she feels like that means she is worthless and has given up everything period. Especially since she's been working on making him (who is apparently miserable too and treats all of his close friends like piss) not miserable for eight years now. Although I don't know the guy personally, I am friends with his past best friend of over ten years who has also finally given up on him and moved on with his life who agrees this girl should give up on him because he will not change and continue to hurt her.

She has no friends other than me and I care deeply for her because she is actually a lovely person but she's essentially been abandoned by her previous friends hence the unhealthy attachment to the online boyfriend of eight years. So yes, she still doesn't trust me fully and she's stubborn so I'm not even sure if my words impact her when I reach out to her because I too an am online friend she met. It's still unclear to me how much she cares for my words, just that she knows that I tell her that I care for her as a person. She's even told me that I should stop dealing with her so that she doesn't become the abusive boyfriend equivalent of my life. I say this mostly in case people say that it's a lost cause and I should move on and find other friends. I feel like if I, her last friend abandons her (not that I will), she will lose her faith in people even more than she already has.

18010,Non-Romantic,1wmisn,"I met my friend while in residence during my first year of university, and we's been roommates for the last two years. 


He's a great guy, really funny and friendly. We have a lot of the same interests, but our personalities clash sometimes. He's more aggressive and brash, while I'm more laid back and chill. This is a product of our friends from earlier in our lives; He hung out with a huge group of guys, partied a lot in highschool, while I had a few close friends and didn't go to too many parties. He's also a wealthy only child who's used to getting exactly what he wants, while I grew up with two sisters and my mom, having to share and work together.


We've had our little fights over chores and minor stuff like that, but overall we've remained good friends.


Recently, though, things have changed. We got a new roommate, a cool guy that has a very similar personality to my friend. I'm social and friendly, but I don't party as hard or are nearly as aggressive or brash as these two. Usually we get along fine, but my friend's been acting like a dick for a while now and it's starting to get to me.


He takes advantage of situations and peer pressures me into doing things that I don't want to do, like giving him food or stealing a beer. If I don't want to go out on a certain night, he takes it as me not being a good friend and there's definitely some tension lingering around the next day.


He'll make jokes about me in front of others that make me seem like a bad person, and I worry people believe it because the things he says are believable.


He and my new roommate gang up on me to prank me, which most times I don't mind as it's all fun and games, but sometimes he goes too far. He forced me to pay for a cab for us three once by running out of the cab once we got to our house, and locking the door behind me so I couldn't get in. When I told him that he was being an asshole, he just laughed it off and told me to stop being so sensitive.


He talks about issues between us two with other people in social situations, to try to peer pressure me into seeing that he was right on something, and make me feel stupid.


Another friend of ours has told me on numerous occassions that he talks shit about me to him, and it's starting to wear me out. I don't want to talk shit about him to other people, because it would be hypocritical of me if I'm so bothered by it.


He's turned into a fairweather friend, one that can be cool when he's just chilling, but be a real asshole when the situation suits him. My other friend told me that he'd throw you under the bus if it was advantageous for him, any chance he'd get. I can clearly see how that's the case.


The annoying thing is that he always talks about how he has my back, how his friends where he's from are all super tight and have each other's backs, but I feel like it's all a lie; his entitled and self-centered attitude speaks to my skepticism.


It seems like he's found a new friend in my roommate to replace me, and while I don't mind a ton that we're not as close as we used to be (I have other close friends), it's hard to live with someone that always seems to be talking behind your back, or planning some prank on you, etc.


I don't like to deal with these situations with revenge; I can't see anything being resolved by that. I try not to care about the stuff he does, and I put on a nonchalant and passive attitude so that he'll think that I don't care, and he'll stop. I tell myself that the things he does are small issues that aren't worth bringing up to him, because a lot of it really is small things and I don't want to seem overbearing. Obviously, this hasn't worked.

 
How do I get through to him that I'm tired of the way he's acting? If I straight up tell him he's being a dick, he asks for examples which I can never fully give him; it's almost more of a general way he is rather than any specific thing he's doing.

He moved back in with his parents who smoke in the house, so we agreed that our baby won't go over there, and when he spends time with her it'll be at my house or he can take her somewhere.

I work 7 days a week 5pm to 10pm. The baby goes to daycare until my ex gets off anywhere from 7pm-9:30pm, then he picks her up and takes her to my house until I get home.

18014,Non-Romantic,33qx9z,"So a little background information. Me and my best friend/roommate, Caroline, have been living together for the past year and a half. Before then, we lived separately but we had a tight-knit group of friends who hung out all the time. Even if we didn’t hang out as a group, Caroline was always over at the house and we’d do and share everything together. She was my go-to person when I needed to talk or just hang out and shoot the shit and we were inseparable. We all graduated and some moved away, and since Caroline and I were both staying in town for at least another year to work and save up, we thought it’d be a great idea to move in together. Since moving in, however, we have drifted apart a lot and I’m not sure whether or not I should talk to her about it.

A huge part of the reason we have drifted apart is because she dates a stupid, immature, manchild (M/25). We’ll call him Rob. The thing about Rob is, on the surface, he seems like a nice, easy-going guy but as their relationship progressed, I saw that that was not the case. They started dating before we moved in together, so they have nearly been together two years now. When I say manchild, I mean that he is 25, still working on his undergrad (he’s a sociology major because he didn’t make the grades to be a criminal justice major like he originally wanted), has a part-time job at a restaurant where he works take-out twice a week and complains about how hard it is to balance school and work two nights a week. Besides rent and utilities that he’s using financial aid and his savings to pay for (he didn’t want to use his savings but has to because he didn’t turn in his financial aid paperwork on time to get the loans he needed for school), his parents still pay everything else for him including gas and groceries. What little money he makes from work he spends on weed and complains about how broke he is all the time—but don’t worry, he always has money for weed. A lot of their relationship revolves around weed and it is quite sad. I think you can smoke in moderation and still lead a productive life—he is the kind of stoner who smokes all day, every day and has no motivation to do anything else. He has no friends, interests or hobbies outside of work and school and Caroline. He is extremely clingy and needy and doesn’t compromise with nor respects Caroline.

They have a lot of other incompatibilities, but since I am mainly focused on how this is affecting our friendship, I’ll provide some examples:

- He constantly gets angry when Caroline makes plans to hang out with her friends. Last weekend, even though they had hung out every day last week (she spends the night there 5-6 nights per week), and had not made any plans for Saturday, he got angry when she told him she was going out of town on Saturday to go shopping with her friends and surprise her best friend for her birthday…..because he just expected that they were going to hang out and was angry she had already made other plans. They fought about it.

- Once me and Caroline were at a friend’s party and she and I were sitting on the couch lip-syncing to some song just being silly and I posted it to my snapchat story, and he got angry with her and texted her some stupid shit like “Oh, looks like YOU’RE having fun…” Apparently, she is not allowed to have fun anymore. To be clear, he was invited to the party and didn’t come.

- He does not try with Caroline’s friends. For a time, I think she tried to include him when we would hang out, but it was apparent he did not want to. If we went out for drinks at 9:00, he wouldn’t show up until 11:30 when we were about to leave. When he does hang out with us, he makes things awkward because it’s very obvious he doesn’t want to be there. He’ll sit there and sulk and not speak and be stand-offish towards us. Once, when they fought, he claimed that the reason he doesn’t like hanging out with Caroline and her friends is because when he comes over, we don’t include him in our conversations. I have never gone out of my way NOT to include him and I’m not sure if he expects me to turn to him every time and ask him if he has any input for the current topic of conversation? While me and my friends had a welcoming attitude towards him at the beginning, he has never had one towards us, and after a while, that attitude diminished.

- When we are all hanging out at the apartment and she invites him over, he’ll act like he’s going to come then at the last minute, try to get her to go over there instead or just make up a stupid excuse to why he can’t come but she was welcome to come over there if she wanted. They had a HUGE fight about this and he said that he would compromise and try to hang out with her and her friends more, but of course nothing has changed except that Caroline is a doormat, and instead of standing up for herself, she just now caters to him and his needs by always going over to his place to hang out with him. It has gotten to the point where all she does is work, come home, shower then go over to his apartment. Last week I probably saw her a total of thirty minutes. I don’t like going over to his apartment to hang out because literally all he does is sit on the couch, smoke weed, and Caroline watches him and his roommate play COD. THEY DO THIS EVERY NIGHT. No thanks. This is also something Caroline has brought up to him, that she’d like if they could spend more quality time together even if it’s something as simple as cooking dinner and watching a movie in his room, but of course, nothing has changed.

Obviously, none of our friends like Caroline and Rob together. It is painfully obvious to everyone that she is settling for him and she can do much better. She has expressed doubts of their relationship since last summer but has done nothing about it. Another issue with Caroline is she’s just a pushover in general, hates confrontation, and has the highest capacity for bullshit that I have ever seen – for example, she stayed in an 8-year relationship with her first love who was a drug dealer, drug addict, convicted felon, and extremely emotionally and verbally abusive. Their relationship was bad 95% of the time but it took 8 years and him finally hitting her, for her to leave. I’m pretty sure she knows deep down that Rob is not the one for her and she’s not “in love” with him, but we are afraid that she will continue to drag this out for far longer than it needs to be.

Another issue our friends are having with Caroline, is that we feel like she is making bad life decisions, including her relationship. Upon graduating, Caroline and I had a plan to save up and travel and work abroad for a year together. Caroline has worked at her customer service job for the past 8 years but gets treated like shit—overworked, not paid enough, not respected. She constantly talks about how she wants to get out of this town and travel with me and blah blah blah, but while the rest of us have graduated and gotten “big girl jobs,” even if it means working an office just to pay the bills and save up to go forward in life, Caroline still has not quit her current job or even tried to look for a new one so she is not saving any money and is barely scraping by paycheck to paycheck. As you can probably predict, me and Caroline are no longer going to travel and work abroad together. I am still going, but she has signed her life off to her job for another two years and has announced that she is moving in with Rob when I leave in September. When she told our friends of this news, NO ONE was excited for her. Instead, we are afraid that Rob’s influence and lack of drive and motivation are going to continue to rub off on her. She only has two real friends left in town, one of them being me, and I just don’t want her to move in with Rob and become one of those couples who only hang out with each other.

Now, I know that you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. I also hate when people try to tell me how to live my life so I wouldn’t want to tell anyone else how to live theirs, but it’s getting to the point that their relationship is driving a wedge between us. Caroline and I don’t make plans to hang out anymore. I see her for a little bit if we both happen to be at home and not working or she isn’t scurrying to hang out with Rob, which isn’t a lot. I see her if the girls all decide to get together, which happens only once every 2 or 3 months realistically. Sometimes I try to make plans with her but she has already made plans with Rob. She often complains that it’s draining for her to see him every day and she doesn’t have time to do basic chores like her laundry and grocery shopping, but he insists they hang out every day. If she suggests she wants space, he gets offended. It has caused a lot of tension, at least on my side. I’m not sure what to do in this situation. I care about her a lot and hate to see her in this situation, but at the same time, I feel like it is not my place to tell her how to live her life even though I feel like her life decisions has caused a strain on our friendship and I'm concerned for her.

TLDR; my best friend/roommate is in a shitty relationship, making shitty life decisions, and it's affecting our friendship. Should I/how should I approach her with this? Any similar experiences or advice would be appreciated. Thanks.

18043,Non-Romantic,1p2unh,"I'm going insane here and I need some help finding the best path forward. I love my sister, and she is truly a miracle worker. She's drop dead gorgeous, makes money stretch as far as it possibly can, is a great cook, is an exceptional mother, and will do whatever she needs to do to make her family more successful. She has her faults, but I deeply respect and admire her. We talk on the phone every day, and I love her family with all my heart. 


The thing is that she's 'engaged' to a total deadbeat. I honestly think of him as her 3rd child. He doesn't cook, clean, fix things around the house, treat the kids very well (serious anger issues), or work. You read that right. This man has two kids and hasn't worked even part time since 2008. He has the idea in his head that he's better than other people, and needs to start at the top, not work his way up from the bottom. Despite that never working for him, he refuses to take a job he doesn't want, which is everything except high ROI, under the table, small scale, short term, fast cash schemes. He has been enrolled in community colleges on and off for about 5 years now, but has not yet earned even an associates degree. He's failed many classes, and the only money he brings home is through financial aid. He's on probation and will lose his financial aid if he fails another class. 


Bonus: He's high all the time. He smokes weed constantly throughout the day and is even more of an asshole if he doesn't get to smoke the minute he walks in the door. My sister hates that he does it, but she gave up the fight. Where he gets money for the habit has not yet been determined. 


Recently their situation has become desperate, and they decided that the first step toward a solution was my sister pawning all her jewelry. This 'man' would rather pawn the ring he gave my sister than get a job. I kid you not. I noticed she wasn't wearing her ring and asked what happened, and the look on her face torn me apart. She's devastated, and I am developing a deep hatred toward my brother-in-law. They've been together a little over 10 years and this guy isn't going anywhere. I've said all I can say to my sis about his behavior, but these two are glued together and she has no intention of leaving him. 


I give my sister about $250 a month in cash for things her and her children desperately need. I visit close to bi-weekly, and when I'm there I help cook, clean, and take care of her children. I feel like I'm enabling his behavior by helping this way but I can't look at myself in the mirror when people I love so much are suffering. The situation is killing me and I don't have the luxury of hating this guy, because my sister will always take his side over mine. The ring has pushed me to a breaking point, and I don't know how I'm going to face him at thanksgiving and not turn into a raging lunatic. 


Any advice is welcome, but please keep in mind she will not end it with him. No break-up advice is going to help. I need to know how I should approach him, and if there is a better way for me to support her. Thank you in advance!

18054,Non-Romantic,2irp5u,"I'm feeling really awkward right now. April  was living with our dad until August, when she had her last straw moment with our stepmother. She asked if she could stay with me (by me, I mean me, my SO, my 7 year old, and our infant) for a couple weeks until she found an apartment. She's my best friend, who usually visits us a couple days a week, so I said of course and that she could stay as long as she needed to. My SO agreed, and even suggested that if she needed something more long term, we could relocate the baby's stuff into our bedroom, and April could pay rent and live there. 

It's been mostly pretty fun having her here. She has a busy schedule of school and work, but we hang out after she gets off. She brings home beer and so we have a few and stay up late. It interferes somewhat with my SO and I going to bed together, but it's not a huge problem. I'm a stay at home mom on a weird baby schedule anyway.

She is generally pretty helpful around the house, also. She buys things here and there like toilet paper, dog food, laundry detergent, etc. She helps tidy up and holds the baby while I shower, all that good stuff.  

However, I am broke. My SO has had a weird job situation over the last couple of months. Bills are getting paid right before the cutoff date, that kind of thing. Our utilities have gone up since she moved in. She eats dinner with us when she's around, and she's pretty much welcome to whatever is around to eat, though a lot of times she feeds herself. She's still sleeping on the couch and hasn't really looked at apartments in a while. 

 When I've mentioned to family members that she's living here, they've asked if she's paying rent and seem shocked that we're struggling the way we are and she isn't. 

So my question is, should she be paying something? What's fair to ask her to pay? Our rent and utilities come to around 1200/month. She's also thinking about getting on my phone plan. I don't worry about that. She's good for the money. She's not the typical broke student. She has savings and a good job. She could move out tomorrow if she found a place, but she's very frugal in a lot of ways. 

How do I ask her without her thinking I'm being greedy or trying to get rid of her? I don't want to hurt our relationship, but it kinda bothers me giving someone a basically free place to live when I can barely pay my bills.

18056,Non-Romantic,21z3mt,"My sister and I were not friends growing up. She had colic as a baby and it's like she never stopped screaming. She's had temper tantrums all her life; has stolen from our cousins', friends' and relatives' houses, and our mother; went through a phase where she would call our mom, dad, aunts and uncles by their first names only; and, although she alienated herself from the rest of our family by being rude, distant, and making snide comments about my cousin (a year older than her), blames *them* for alienating *her*.

As teens, we rarely spoke and were always at odds. I was depressed and withdrawn while my sister acted out - screaming fits (temper tantrums her whole life), suicide attempts, promiscuity, was hospitalized a few times. She attacked me once (just with her hands) and I pretty much peaced out of the house after that.

I eventually moved 200+ miles away, which has helped our relationship a lot. I began reaching out and she reciprocated; we would text and send little presents for birthdays and holidays. Despite that, when I would visit home and actually interact with her, I felt the same as I did as a teenager - detached, physically and emotionally. There was something I just didn't like about her. It's very hard to describe without sounding like an asshole, which I wholly admit that I have acted like many times throughout the years with her. We have both apologized for a lot of things now that we're older.

Here's the thing. I recently found out - from a family member who shit himself when he found out I didn't know - that two years ago, several FBI agents searched my grandmother's house, where my sister was living at the time. Turns out her ex-boyfriend (who I had met and interacted with a few times) was in possession of child porn. He was arrested and convicted last year. NO ONE in my family told me. I know, in my gut, that my mother didn't tell me because she protects my sister from me. Even though I don't think she had ANYTHING to do with it - it's just an awful thing that happened - it had to be kept from me, because I don't walk on eggshells around her.

This is the same weekend that I found out that her current boyfriend is a 36-year-old line cook at a restaurant she was fired from. He is divorced and has partial custody of his two young children. The same day I find out that my family has been keeping a crazy-ass secret from me for 2 years - EASILY the nuttiest thing to ever happen to our family - she calls and tells me that she drove her bf to do taxes with his ex, and she hates her because she gets 50% or 80% (something like that) of his tax return, and because they don't know if she's spending the money on the kids, and oh, I just hate her, and I just want someone to tell me it's okay to feel that way.

I told her: 1) You don't know about divorce law or taxes. I can't imagine a scenario where she would be entitled to so much of his tax return without him agreeing to it. 2) It is not appropriate for a 36-year-old man to be in a romantic relationship with a 21-year-old girl. It's just not fucking appropriate in any scenario. Ever.


Next thing I know, I'm deleted from her Facebook page and she cuts me off because I've never supported her. My parents? They walk on eggshells around her. They say as long as she's happy, they're happy. If we say something, she'll just cut us out. They won't even make their displeasure known! My mom sure as hell isn't worried about it - she wrote Happy anniversary! on their 6-month anniversary Facebook post. I'm disgusted.

I don't like my sister. If we weren't siblings, we wouldn't be friends.

18094,Non-Romantic,29kpix,"**Background:** Whenever my younger sister (whom I’ll call J) gets into a relationship she becomes distant with all of her friends and family. She ignores phone calls and texts unless it's her bf or his friends. J’s first relationship was during her first year of college. The relationship was extremely toxic (he was controlling and emotionally abusive), however having never been in a relationship she chalked it up to being normal and that this is what love is. This is when her relationship of trying to balance her love life and the relationship with her friends/family began to deteriorate. My sister has always had a good relationship with my family but when she was dating her first bf, she would cut ties completely and only contact them when a payment was due as my parents pay for her tuition. 

Now J is in a new relationship. She’s staying at her college for the summer b/c she has an internship. The internship is unpaid. She is working another job but the pay is very minimal (she only works 3x a week) and therefore my parents are still covering the bulk of the cost for her to stay down there. Recently, J has asked my parents for $900 to cover for her upcoming apartment bill (the one she’s living in for this upcoming year and the one she’s staying in). The problem is J has a tendency to ignore people when she’s in a relationship and it has been difficult to get a hold of her. She only will answer a call/text when it concerns money. Now I find out that the apartment my parents are paying for her to stay at-- her bf is living with her. My parents know that she has a bf but not that he’s living with her nor that they are paying for his expenses as well b/c he is living there. Her roommate that is supposed to be living with her in her current apartment will not be moving in until mid July but has stated he didn’t want other people living there. B/c my parents work hard and have odd hours (they travel a lot), they’ve asked me to get a hold of my sister and to have her break down the costs that this $900 needs to be covered for. I asked for details and to provide the bills. She has gotten defensive and ignores my texts or doesn’t answer my questions when she chooses to answer back to my texts.

She claims b/c she is working hard as a pre-med student that her deteriorating relationship with her family and friends is excusable. That any financial aspect in regards to J is none of my concern. But I am worried b/c she demands money and will make a huge fuss about it but won’t be direct with my parents about the costs. She asks for a lump sum but doesn’t provide pictures of the bills, rarely speaks on the phone or answers their texts, and now is going behind their back by having her bf live with her-- whom they’ve never properly met. J claims to be busy but has weekends off. Now I find out on those weekends she’s binge drinking and getting high. J is an adult so those are her choices to make but when she’s still financially dependent I feel she needs to show more respect and not make excuses as to why she ignores her family and her friends. J has never been good at balancing relationships with her bf and the ones she had before her bf came into the picture. In her mind one has to give and it is usually the latter. She becomes codependent on her bf (hangs out only with his friends, takes all the same classes, etc etc). They are both pre-med majors but have not taken the MCATs yet. She claimed she would be studying for them this summer but then every weekend has been out drinking/getting high/or going to music festivals. I only know this b/c of a mutual friend that J and I have. This mutual friend goes to the same university as J and is down there for the summer for her research position. None of this my parents know b/c J refuses to talk to them until she needs money from them. Am I being unreasonable by feeling an intervention is needed? This issue is between her and my parents but she rarely speaks to them and my parents work odd hours and travel a lot so as the older sister they have asked me from time to time to check in on J and to make sure everything is okay. However, I have also had difficult getting a hold of J and the last time we talked it turned into an argument in which J’s shifted the entire blame on me for trying to ruin her life. What should I do? Do I let it go or do I tell my parents what is going on since it’s obvious J will not be doing it anytime soon.

18102,Non-Romantic,29a2bh,"I feel incredibly selfish posting this at all. But it's how I feel.

My mom is retired and my dad is retiring hopefully in the next three years. Both have health issues but nothing imminently life threatening. I know this is years off, but the topic has come up lately. 

Growing up, I spent a lot of time alone in my room reading or just being by myself because of my brother and the fact that my parents had to spend a lot more time taking care of him. My brother has a number of mental health issues and disabilities. He has ADD, ADHD, general anxiety, dysgraphia (mild), dyslexia (mild), depression, and had to have occupational therapy as a kid because of coordination problems. Lucky for my brother, both my parents have social work degrees (my mom was one until retirement and my dad switched careers before I was born) and knew how to handle a lot of these issues. But it's always different when it's your kid.

To summarize basically an entire lifetime. My brother got pretty screwed as a kid despite the fact that we went to a pretty good public school. Some teachers and administrators did a lot for him. Others were cruel and intolerant. BUT my brother is also... Just kind of a different kid. He's very smart, and my mom had his IQ tested (among other things) when he was younger, but his disabilities make it difficult for him to learn things. Nonetheless, he is also spoiled and impatient. Not that I am a psychologist and can diagnose these things, but pretty much my whole life, if he felt he couldn't do something or didn't want to do it, he would throw tantrums and got in trouble for his behavior. He's still pretty much like that to this day, though it has gotten better since he went to a high school for higher functioning kids with disabilities.

Currently, he's in a computer science program for IT. He was in college at an art school for three years and only got about half way through a degree program before switching to another one then eventually dropping out. My parents paid for all of this. After a break year, he's at another college for an IT program which he just started in the spring. He changes his mind a lot, pretends he forgets to do work or lies about not having any or having already done it. My mom recently told me he wanted to drop a core class because he didn't think it was related to the program and he wasn't interested in it -- but it's foundational for his program so she said no.

Basically, he has literally no friends and spends almost all of his time at home (he has a room in my parent's basement) on the computer. Sometimes he can be the sweetest kid, but my mom, to this day, still has to wake him up in the morning, drive him to the train stop, make sure he takes his medication, make meals for him/remind him it's meal time, etc. Personally, I think if my parents left him entirely alone for even two days he would forget his medications and just wouldn't be able to handle it. He's never lived outside home. My dad helps a bit, but for the most part my mom does everything. And I know she's at the end of her rope.

My brother can be a kind person, and he's smart and engaging to talk to. But he is also a complete asshole. He says terrible things to my mom and dad and is very greedy about money. For example, on his birthday he received presents and my parents had given him some money early to buy a video game -- he then asked after opening his presents where another gift was that my parents allegedly promised to get him. And he knows what he's doing, he's just spoiled and rude. Last time I was at their house, I was talking to my mom about Netflix shows and movies she would like since she spends a lot of time at home with my brother and my parents' dog. He refused to share the password with them unless they paid him -- and they pay for everything he has. Eventually I kinda joked around until he would let my mom use it.

I guess what I'm getting at is, he's selfish and manipulative but not necessarily a malicious person. I feel sorry for my mom that she has spent her entire life having to monitor everything he does. And I feel sorry for him because, well, honestly I'm worried he might kill himself one day while my parents are out on a date or running errands. He's almost entirely alone in his life and he's never even held a job. Maybe my parents spoiled him or didn't push him enough as a kid, but he is who he is now.

Anyway... Recently my mom mentioned that she was worried about what would happen to him when she was gone. I kept my mouth shut, but it's something I've worried about too. I do love my brother but I just graduated from law school with 180k in debt. I can't support myself well, at least for now, and I probably will be paying these loans off for at least 15 years. I can't see affording supporting my brother, nor would I want to live with him.

My mom said she would never expect me to take him in or support him -- but I feel shitty even feeling that way. What will he do when they're gone? They have money saved for him and I'm sure they could set up an account held in trust for him with someone monitoring money use, but it can't be that much money and I can see that going terribly wrong. And again, how would he take care of himself? Having a nurse come in or something? I don't see that working either. Maybe one day he'll be able to hold down a job, but as of now, I can't see him even holding on to a job in food service or in a stock room. He's bad at taking commands and is not someone who can smile and suck things up even when they dislike a job.

I know if my brother had to move in with me and my fiance (later, husband) as adults it would be miserable for everyone but I don't see any other outcome.

I know this is highly speculative and I guess I'm a terrible person for thinking and feeling this way but I can't help it. Has anyone else experienced a family situation like this? What did you do?

&gt; Monday 23rd May:

Our sister, Renae, had just arrived home from three weeks holiday. She phoned our Dad's mobile and was put on loudspeaker while she told us all about her trip. After a while, she said Am I still on loudspeaker? I'd like to talk to Mum and Dad in private. It's a secret.

**This is incredibly uncharacteristic for our family, as we openly discuss everything and anything - nothing is sacred in our home.** 

Mum and Dad went out to the balcony and were there speaking to Renae for over an hour. They came back inside with no emotion on their face, just like the conversation had not occurred. 

&gt; A few days later:

I casually asked Mum if Renae was okay and if everything was alright, and she responded very bluntly Yes, I'm not saying anything. She's fine.

Christine told me later that day that she had had a similar conversation with Dad.

Christine and I have a girls' night with Renae, and all of our How are you? questions were deflected. Nothing at all was mentioned.

Renae rings Christine and asks if she can pick her up on her way home from work to stay at our house for the night - she said she'd had an operation on Tuesday, suffered some complications on Wednesday, and was now not allowed to be alone. Her fiance is working tonight, so she wanted to stay with us.

Christine texts me and we both flip out - Holy shit! She's had an operation?? Is our sister okay??

Over dinner, Renae passed her phone around to show us all a funny picture of her in her hospital bed that her SO had taken of her on Wednesday night.

Christine and I are very upset that we were not told about Renae's procedure. We think that if she wanted to keep it a secret from us, that's her right, but we've been given too many clues and hints to be able to let it slide. She's our big sister, we love her more than the world, and we think we deserve to know if she's healthy, happy, and safe.

18113,Non-Romantic,2j00n6,"Hey so I have this friend, lets call him Jay. Jay and I were part of this big group of friends that I had a falling out with over some apartment stuff. I can go into detail about that if requested but long story short: I invited some of them to live with me this year but they tried to exclude me at the beginning by looking for apartments without me. In the end, I had to bail because I couldn't afford the apartment we were looking at and they used that as an excuse to kick me out of the group entirely. I apologized but they didn't accept it. None of them have talked to me or asked to hang out in 5 months. 

--
The thing is, Jay and I used to be really close. I tried to talk to him a little while after getting kicked out, and it seemed like we were cool. However, he never messaged me or hung out with me after we had that talk. I ended up cutting ties with him completely a little while ago because it physically hurt to think about how much our friendship used to mean to me. I didn't really think he cared at all anymore until recently. A couple of days ago, he spoke to a mutual friend of ours about me, saying that he just didn't understand why I would cut him out of my life and why we weren't friends anymore. He wondered if something hurt me more than he realized. My friend told him that I probably wouldn't have a problem with talking to him about it but that they could talk about it more later if he wanted. The mutual friend spoke to me about it and I had her send him a text to Jay saying Do you still want to talk about (me)? If so we can talk or you also can just send (me) a text because I really think he would be willing to talk. 

--
Now here is where I am at: Jay has not responded to the text, which makes me wonder whether or not he was sincere about talking or if it was just guilt getting the better of him. But the thing is...I kinda thought I hated him. I couldn't believe that my best friend didn't even care about me enough to miss me. Its taken him 5 months to get to this point, 5 months of not having me around and it just didn't seem like he was ever going to say anything. But deep down I love the guy. I miss him so much that every new friendship I make just doesn't feel right because it doesn't measure up to the friendship I had with him. I hate my current apartment because all I can think about is how much I wish we had been able to live together. All i've really wanted to do for the last 5 months is to message him again and start joking around like we used to. But I just don't know if he feels the same about our friendship. He still won't say anything...is he just scared? or does he not care? It's been so long too. Is it even worth it to try and go back to the way things used to be?

We live in Southern California.  So if anyone in the area has advice, that would be really helpful, too.

**tl;dr**  My youngest sister, Janet, is in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend, Rico.  My family has now been made aware of the abuse, and want to confront her about it before it gets worse.  My family is all very close, especially my sisters and I.  I really wish I didn't have to turn to reddit for advice on this, but I lurk /r/relationships all the time, and the advice here is usually good, and I think and outside perspective will help.

**Backstory** My youngest sister, Janet, first started dating her boyfriend, Rico, when they were 16 and met in high school.  At first their relationship seemed normal, maybe some tiny spats here and there, but eventually my sister let it known that he was being verbally abusive, and manipulative. sometimes even threatening her with violence towards himself if she would leave him.

Eventually it came out he had been cheating on her with a few girls from their school, and he broke up with my sister, but still continued to harass her for a few months until he dropped out and moved away (still in the same state, but hours away, thankfully), but he would still sometimes harass her through her tumblr, instagram, and facebook.  I believe he was using either his friends or fake accounts to watch her, I don't know.  I just know he would send her messages or leave comments still degrading and abusing her.

**the current issue**

It's now around 3 years later, and Rico is back, although now they are in a LDR.  I'm not sure how it happened, but he had convinced my sister he has changed and things were different...and they were at first, so we (my family and I) decided to give him the benefit of the doubt.  But, he has NOT CHANGED ONE BIT, he seems to have gotten even WORSE.

I'm just going to bullet some incidents for now as my mind is so jumbled at the moment I can't really think.

* My sister, Jesse, happens to share a room with Janet and has overheard Rico screaming at Janet and threatening her, calling her a slut, ugly, stupid.  Accusing her of wanting to fuck her male friends, my male friends, anyone.  Janet is also religious, and Rico will use that against her claming God knows you're lying to me or God thinks the way you treat me is shit, I've prayed and spoke to God and he told me you're a sinner

* Janet also does travel around sometimes to do photoshoots for some friends of her, and Rico doesn't like it, he's started accusing her of wanting to fuck her photographer, and was trying to get her to admit that her photographer would fuck her if he had the chance.  When Janet denied this (Especially since the people who she models for/the photographer are in a long-term relationship AND good friends of hers) he called her an ignorant, oblivious, bitch


Eventually she broke it off with him again, and his attitude changed from him calling her and texting her telling her how sorry he was, and how he'd changed.  How he missed her and was wrong, to him screaming and abusing her and then he started sending her pictures of his self-mutilation on his arms and wrists and said he would kill himself if she didn't get back together.

He eventually said the self-mutilation pictures were fake, but I don't see how it makes it any better.

I've tried telling her this isn't healthy.  This isn't how a relationship, or love should be.  She shouldn't need to feel held hostage, and I tried to encourage her to leave and block his number. If he's going to kill himself, call the cops!  He needs real help, not her.

  But she decided to stay with him, and not mention how they're doing to me or our other sister at all now.  But we know things are still fucked up, because whenever he's mean to her, she takes it out on us, being snippy and aggressive.  She has to be in contact with him 24/7 or he'll start texting and calling her acting all crazy.  She's not even allowed to sleep if he wants to talk.  If they aren't texting, they're on Skype, and she's not allowed to be around us when this happens.  She has to go outside, or lock herself in a room and hide from us.  But sometimes we hear her crying, and him yelling...and it just makes me feel so sick and upset. 

I know you can't convince people to leave their abusers, and the more you pull them apart, the harder they will fight but it's my sister, and she was my best friend until this happened.  

I'm sorry if I rambled, I'm just trying to give as much info as I can.

The main issue is my family has now discovered she plans to go visit him for a week and is leaving on Sunday (which is why I am kind of rushing to write this now).  The reason for a week is in quotes is, Jesse, snooped through Janets phone (huge invasion of privacy, I know, I know.  But she said she had a gut feeling so there's that.) and went to her texts with Rico and found more abuse (it is so sad seeing how he talks to her, and she's so nice to him.  I don't get it) a plan for our sister to go LIVE WITH HIM when she leaves on Sunday, not telling us this was the plan.  Jesse took screen shots and sent them to me, so I have them to show my parents.

We know she's 20, and it's her own life.  But I feel we should at least try to stop her, or something!  This kid is poke-a-hole-in-the-condom crazy (also, my sister is too scared to go to planned parenthood and get her own BC) , or worse I really feel he might actually hurt her.

My sister is also very immature, has never worked in her life (except to modeling, but she doesn't get paid), and if she went up there she would just be stuck living in this guys grandparents basement completely dependent on him.  Not to mention he lives in one of the most crime ridden cities in California.

She depends on Me, our mom, and our dad to get around.  She's too lazy to walk anywhere.  So the only way for her to actually leave is for one of us to give her a ride to the train station.  I have already told her that I do not want to drive her, as I don't want her leaving to go see that boy.  

But she's already asked my mom, and my mom is planning to take her because she's an adult.  But I think she's enabling my sister go get abused, and if something does happen, it will be on her for taking her to the train in the first place.  I mean, if she was addicted to drugs, would it be enabling her if we gave her a ride to the dealers house?  YES.  But, I feel like I might be the only one to see it that way...

I feel if she really wants to see and be with Rico so bad, we should NOT help her in any way, shape, or form.  It's not like she has money to take a taxi to the train station, and I doubt she would walk to take the bus/trolley to the train either.  So telling her no I'm not giving you a ride would just be one step in the right direction.  Then if she does make it there on her own, we had no part in it.

Janet is the baby of the family so she is pretty spoiled.  She has screaming fits and tantrums when she doesn't get her way, and always talks about dying...I think my mom is just trying to avoid the drama it's going to cause if we don't drive her.  But I feel we should let her act crazy, and if she starts talking about suicide and wanting to die, call the cops so she stops pulling this over-dramatic bullshit to get her way.

Jesse and I want to sit down with Janet tonight, possibly with both of our parents. But we don't if/how we should tell her about the texts...or even how to approach her and let her know hey, we know shit is not good, and it is not a good idea to go see this boy.  We just want her to be safe, and happy. She is withdrawing and closing off to us and it is very worrying.  

I'm just at a total loss at what to do or say.  I'm usually the level-headed sister, and the one everyone comes to when we need stuff sorted out logically and civilly...but this is way out of my league.

If anything needs more explaining, please let me know.

Okay, so back history - my dad was married before he married my mother. A couple of times. This one in particular, is Ursula. Ursula and my dad divorced for reasons I'm not privy to. I just know that my mother absolutely hated Ursula. But my mother hated everyone, so this may or may not be relevant. 

My mother died 11 years ago, so it was just me and my dad and my daughter, Amy, who was born a couple months after my mother died. 

After a couple years, my dad started going out more. Honestly, I was glad for him. He didn't talk about it much, but I happened across cards Ursula had given him and put two and two together. He eventually told me who he was spending time with, and I told him I was happy for him.

And then I met her. My dad had to get a medical thing done (nothing major, just needed me for transport), and she had invited herself. Fine, no big deal, I got to know her in the waiting room. 

Immediately she was subtly condescending. I couldn't put my finger on it, but she just sort of rubbed me wrong. 

But I ignored this. 

Then, I overheard my dad talking on the phone to her one day, (thankfully) defending me, saying, No, Ursula, I think [mydadsexwifehatesme] is a great mother. So it's safe to say she was critiquing my parenting after meeting me once when Amy had slept in her stroller the whole time. 

Then, some months later, I'd called my dad while he was on a trip with Ursula to let him know Amy and I were going to a friends house for a while if he needed to reach us (my cell phone at the time was unreliable), and he didn't hang up. I tried calling out to him, but I ended up hearing them talk. He had relayed what I'd said, that Amy and I were going to spend some time with my friend Angela, and she starts berating this friend that she literally has never heard anything about, saying that I'm just dragging my kid around all over the city and exposing her to those kinds of people (still don't know what that means). He defended me again, and I hung up feeling really glad that he stood up for me, but really bad that she hated me so much.

Then there was a family reunion where she invited herself and then cornered me while I was watching Amy run around my dad and play and said I'm surprised [Dad] likes you and Amy so much, considering he never even wanted kids. (I'm adopted)

I was flabbergasted, and didn't say anything, just walked away.



**CURRENT ISSUE**

Well, I've mostly managed to avoid her since, I met my husband and moved out, we have four kids between us now including Amy. But lately she's been calling me. She knows (my dad has told her, after she called him yelling that I didn't answer the phone) that I keep odd hours. Amy and the other two older children are self-sufficient, make their own breakfast, don't need me so much, so my 3 year old and I sleep in till about noon. This works out as I have night-anxiety, so it's easier just to stay up and sleep in. But she'll call at 8 in the morning, knowing I'm sleeping. I do not answer the phone at that hour for anyone other than my dad or my husband as everyone knows my hours, and they would only call then if it's important. But Ursula calls anyway, getting upset that I don't answer. 

When she's called, it's been to tell me that my dad is losing his mind, that I shouldn't trust him to watch after the kids, that sort of thing. Keep in mind that I see my dad much more than she does, I spend significantly more time with him than she does, and I'm very familiar with dementia and Alzheimer's symptoms. 

My dad does have a family history of Alzheimer's. However, he attends regular doctor's appointments (his health is very important to him, and no one would guess he's as old as he is because he's sharp and active), and his doctors are not concerned at this time. 

I *have* noticed some memory issues with my dad. Nothing major. He's just more forgetful than he used to be. I still have no issues with him looking after my kids, even my 3 year old, though I do prefer if an older kid is there to help because he's got weakness in one arm and my 3 year old is huge. 

But Ursula is convinced that it's Alzheimer's setting in. I've let her ramble in these phone calls to me, while she goes on about this or that, or berates my mother. I listen to what she says, but take it with a grain of salt. Even my dad says she's always being dramatic about something. 

Today, however, I've hit my limit with her bullshit. I've been sick with the flu for the last few days. I feel miserable, can't get out of bed without barfing, etc. So when she called yesterday morning - waking me and my toddler up again - I didn't answer. I also didn't answer when she called two more times that day. Kinda didn't give a shit about hearing it when I already feel bad. Well, I'm a little better today, so today when she called, I picked up to see what she wanted. 

She asked me if I knew my dad was having an upper GI procedure Monday - I did, my dad and I always talk about that stuff, and his best friend of like, a million years is giving him transport to and from - and she started demanding that I go with him because he's too old and the procedure is too dangerous. It's not, btw. They're electing to do it because the benefits outweigh the small risk. 

But she kept going on about how something was going to happen, and I had to be there because I would have to make medical decisions for him. She wasn't suggesting, she was demanding that I go. Before I could say a word, she just repeated herself, saying, YOU NEED TO BE THERE. BYE. and hung up on me.

I'm not going to infantilize my dad on her say-so, and I'm pretty damned pissed that she's ordering me around, and then hanging up on me.

I've blocked her number, but I know she'll figure that out and I want to talk to my dad so I can get ahead of this shitfest. So, I'm gonna drop by his house tomorrow (he needed his printer fixed anyway, so that'll be my excuse) and I want to lay my cards on the table. The thing is, my dad is old. I put up with Ursula's shit for so long because honestly, I was just glad my dad wasn't lonely, even if I hated her. But it's stepping on my turf now, with the phone calls, and the direct and blatant disrespect, and I will not let that go. 

How do I tell my dad this in a way that doesn't just sound like an attack or a whiny child? I have a hard time being cool about these things when I'm upset, so if I have some pre-thought out words and phrasings I'd be able to handle it more maturely. Because right now the only thing I can think of to say is your girlfriend is a cunt, and I'm not going to talk to her ever again and I know that's now how I want to approach it. Help me /r/relationships, you're my only hope.

About a year and a half ago, Amy and Rob split. 

Rob and I hadn't really spoken at all since my ex and I split up, but I got a random message from him today asking for the supervisor (Allen)  wife's name.

I fucking mind because whenever she asks him to do it either messes up plans we've made because now he needs to cancel to look after the dogs or we simply can't make any plans. Then he's constantly at her house and I never get to see him when he watches them. Like why cant she take her dogs with her to the lake?? They are her dogs! Sure once or twice is fine but it has been more than that. 

I don't want to say anything to the sister though because it feels like it isn't my place. After all she isn't asking me to watch them, she's asking her brother and it just affects me. I've told my boyfriend every time she's asked that I don't like it and he should say no and stop being a push over but he continues to watch them anyway. 

I don't know if I'm getting irrationally mad at this because there is something else I'm actually mad at like the fact that I can't stand that she's unemployed and isn't even trying to help herself, yet I have to hear her whine about money. Education and working hard are important to me and to see someone just laze around like that is not someone I want in my life. Maybe that plus the dog thing is just putting me in a really angry place with her. 

**Edit: they also have another sibling - another brother but the sister never asks him because she knows he will tell her no so she asks my boyfriend all the time instead. We have been dating for a year and 9 months or so**

18214,Non-Romantic,2wcmyj,"TL; DR my sister is psycho and my parents won't do anything,  im leaving soon and wont be able to help. Advice?

Sorry in advance about formatting,  im on my phone. So basically, my sister ( lets call her abby) is crazy. I graduated from high school last spring, and took a year off before leaving for college, in order to work, save money, live a little bit before school. In order to save my money ive been living at home. 

Because of my parents divorce, I have not lived full time with my sister since we were 13 and 11. That all changed when my dad lost his house due to his own dumbassery. Now both my father and my sister are living in my mothers house, for about a year now. My dad is for sure adding to the overall stress level in the house (they got divorced for a reason thats for damn sure) but he is not the main issue, Abby is. 

Abby is 17 and completely intolerable. She doesn't wake up for school at least 3 times a week, and thats with my parents trying to get her up, including lots of shouting very early in the morning. I work 14 hour days as a waitress at 2 jobs and get routinely woken up 2-3 hours early. She leaves school early whenever she feels like it, and has her dumbass 22 year old weed dealer boyfriend pick her up. This same dumbass is also constantly at our house, even going so far as selling bud out of her bedroom.  I'm 90% sure she hasn't done homework ever, and as such she is going to be a super senior. She complains about how sad she is that this is happening but does nothing to fix it. 

On top of all this school shit she is super manipulative, towards everybody. She has been cutting herself since she was 13, and uses the threat of this to manipulate my parents into letting her get away with whatever she wants. When she does cut, its actually pretty fucked up. Her tits, thighs, and hips all have scars, and one entire arm is so covered in giant fleshy pink scar tissue that it looks completely ridiculous,  to the point where it is so irreparable and obvious that any future career she might possibly have is already at risk. She is diagnosed as clinically depressed,  but im sure her mental illness goes beyond just that, as well as her refusal to take her prozac. 

My parents refuse to force her to get a job, despite the fact that she owes me almost $200 (she shattered my windshield by kicking it and I replaced it out of pocket) instead my mom just wants to subtly slide me Abbys tax return (she had a summer job for 3 months,  till she decided flipping burgers was too hard) which she doesnt know shes getting. They refuse to make her take any kind of responsibility for anything she does. Abby is rude, unclean (one of the grossest people ive ever met, she even steals my clean panties and bras when she doesnt feel like doing laundry) and completely reliant on others, as well as being emotionally abusive and an all around poisonous person to be around. 

I'll be moving out for college in 6 months, and im worried her behavior will only be worse without me around. I can see her living at home for the rest of her life with no problems and no repercussions. Even when i try to do what i can to force some kind of parenting on her, my dad just screams and bitches at me that its not my job or place to parent her, when they refuse to set boundaries of any sort. My parents are good people, but weak when it comes to her. I have no fucking idea what to do about this whole situation.

18255,Non-Romantic,35pyms,"Keep in mind as you read through this that everyone involved has been in their 30s throughout this ordeal.  I met now-BF and his group of friends, who have all been friends since they were kids, several years ago.  BF was the fun drunk guy of the group.  I liked the group and they liked me.  BF would go out with them getting drunk 4-5 days a week including weekends.


About 2 years ago, BF started getting tired of partying all the time and wanted to share his life with someone.  We started dating and we just... clicked.  He started to move into my place around the 6-7 month mark.  My house and BF's house are almost an hour apart, which is part of the reason he basically moved in at 6 months.  BF lives in the same town as the group, so it's harder for us to get together with everyone.  During the week is basically impossible, but we would make the effort to spend some time there over the weekend.


Initially, BF's friends were thrilled that we were dating.  But when things started getting more serious between us, they became jealous of the time we spent alone.  They blamed me for taking their friend away.  They called me controlling behind my back and they all started hating me.  They tried to sew doubt in BF's mind about our relationship.  They would pick on me when I was out with them.  


Anything remotely negative BF told them about our relationship they would harangue me (and probably him) about endlessly.  For example, I got to hear from all his friends about how I was being so cruel - CRUEL! - to him for not giving him half of the closet in the master bedroom, when his he didn't need that much space and didn't have a problem with it.  Or they would tell me I didn't deserve him because I wouldn't get rid of my dog because of BF's mild allergies.  BF loves my dog, he would never want me to get rid of her.  It was really upsetting, but I left it to BF to handle since they were his friends.  I pretty much just told them I'm not having those discussions with them.


This escalated to several of them screaming and yelling at me at a party, and when I tried to leave (crying), one of them started throwing things at me hard enough to leave cuts and bruises.  BF was in the bathroom when this was happening and came out after it was over, to find me crying and bleeding on someone's front lawn.  The person who attacked me apologized to BF but never apologized to me.  I was totally traumatized from this event.  As an aside, I have a lot of anxiety issues stemming from an abusive childhood and prior abusive relationship.    


BF didn't realize how bad things had gotten with his friends until this incident, and wanted to smooth it over.  Despite his efforts, some people started texting BF nonstop that everyone hated me, the attack never happened I was just making it up (they weren't present for the attack), and he needs to leave me.  He had a couple come-to-Jesuses with them and they would stop for a little while, but would start up again.  Finally they called BF and me drunk in the middle of the night on a weeknight and left 10 voicemails saying they hate me.  I saved the voicemails in case I had to go to the police.  BF was pissed at them and went no contact about 6 months ago.


About a month ago, some of them started making overtures to BF.  One person recently texted both of us saying she didn't know what had gone down (he participated in everything but the physical attack) but wanted to work it out.  I'm glad to get some form of apology finally, but it doesn't seem like these people have any concept of how awful they've been to me.  BF isn't ready to forgive them yet but I know he wants his group back.   He doesn't really understand my anxiety about being around them again - he doesn't really get anxious at all, not for public speaking, heights, anything - but he wants to respect my feelings.  I don't think I can say never, but idk how to move forward from here.  Idk what's reasonable to expect of BF in handling this.

Recently I got an fb message from her and the gist of it was, she has a 19 year old daughter whose mine and wants to meet me. At first I was EXTREMELY skeptical, she assured me she wasn't calling for years of child support, she came from a wealthy (ish) family who supported her and her or my or our daughter and she never bothered to call me as I was young, in university and she would have felt bad to drop that bomb on me then, I don't come from a rich family, only through working my ass off the past few years I have a nice enough home that's comfy and a few nice things. She told me if I didn't believe her I could take a paternity test, just for the sake of alleviating my concerns. I found out the girls date of birth and it all added up, even though me and old gf/fwb (who I'll call sarah now) had just been fwbs, we'd been with each other exclusively those last few months.

18262,Non-Romantic,3ccsou,"I've never lived with my father since I was very young.  He and my mother divorced, he's moved to the other side of the country, and I lived with my mother.  I've visited him twice a year as a child, and once a year as a teen and adult.  Now I'm 24, and I live far from both my parents.

When I was a kid, I loved visiting my dad. He'd spoil me every time I visited, which was drastically different than living with my mom. He'd let me do whatever I wanted, when my mom was quite strict. As I grew older, it sort of flipped around.  My mother gave me increased independence as I grew up, but my dad got more controlling.

When I visit my father, he's very strict about how I dress.  I'm not allowed to wear shorts, sleeveless shirts, or anything lower cut than a t-shirt.  I'm allowed to wear tight jeans because it's typically all I own/bring but he'll make fun of how inappropriate it is.  This is still the case, now that I'm an adult.  It makes visiting him very uncomfortable because he lives in south Texas.  He also makes fun of how frumpy I dress, but that's because all the clothes he considers appropriate that I own is frumpy.  For example, he asks me why I never look like a woman and wear dresses, but won't let me wear anything above the ankle, and I don't own maxi dresses.  He asks why I never do my hair and wear makeup, but it's not like I have friends there so who would I need to impress?

He's also very against anyone in his family doing things independently.  If he has to go to the store, we all (his kids, me, his wife, etc) all have to go, even if it's just to by one pair of shoes for him.  If I have to go to the store to buy something, they all have to go too.  I find it weird and invasive, but he says he just likes a family to do things together.

He also likes to use guilt to get me to do what he wants, usually involving my siblings.  His two other children (half-siblings) are 10 and 18 years younger than me.  He's always saying things like If you go out your sister will miss you, she'll cry, she loves you, and when she reached adolescence, it switched to my even younger brother and now he's the one who cries when I leave.  To be fair they do actually cry when I do things without them, but in my opinion they need to be taught that adults do things without them sometimes and they can't always have their way.

Once, when I was 19, he took the whole family to dinner at one of his friend's house.  It was just a bunch of boring adults having dinner, which he drags me and my siblings to all the time, but this time his friend had a sixteen year old daughter.  She and her friends invited me to a concert, because they thought I was cool and needed an adult chaperone.  I said I would go, and told my dad.  He tried to stop me, but I went anyway.  I figured I was 19, and they were giving me a ride, so why not.  When I got back, I was met with a barrage of guilt.  He said that my sister cried the whole time, she was heartbroken that I ignored her to hang out with older kids, that I'm a bully to her.  I felt like shit the rest of the trip.  I love my sister, but I should be able to do things without her sometimes.

When I visit, I basically am on constant babysitting duty.  I'm OK babysitting, but I don't really like taking care of children, and in my opinion his kids are spoiled.  They're used to getting their way all the time, and will whine and scream when I don't do whatever they say.  If I refuse any command from them, they'll go to my dad, or their mom who will tell me to be nicer to them.  I can't babysit under those parameters, especially since they're so energetic. His wife spoils the kids even more than he does.  If they scream at a store that they want something, she'll buy it.  She's a pushover and it's depressing to watch.  

Now, my sister is 13 and much more mature and less spoiled than she was, but there's still my brother who's still 7.  My sister is going through all the stuff I went through when I was her age with my dad.  She's not allowed to go out with her friends because her little brother will cry.  I can sympathize because I went through the same to an extent, but she has to live with this full time and I can't imagine how frustrating that must be for her.

I actually enjoy talking to her, now that she's older, but she won't speak freely in front of her parents, and it's hard to get alone time with her.  Now that she's older, her parents don't want her alone with me much.

Even if I (or now, my sister) tries do have some alone time on the computer, my dad will come up and say something like “What are you doing?”  or “What's so important on that computer that you ignore us?”  or things like that.

Another thing, and this is totally a first world problem, but I really don't like how he insists on paying for so much stuff in my life.  He keeps sending me money and gifts and buying me things and it makes me uncomfortable.  I have my own job, and my own money, and I don't like feeling like I owe him.  I worked hard to achieve financial independence exactly so this would stop, and it didn't.

Usually when I visit nowadays I visit for around a week.  It's a constant passive aggressive fight, he asks me to visit for two weeks, I tell him I don't have that much vacation time, he asks me to visit 10 days, I tell him I have other relatives I need to see, he says that my siblings over there miss me and they'll cry if I only come for a few days, I insist I don't have time, and we end up meeting in the middle.  Usually many lies are involved, because I can't just tell him that I won't spend all my vacation days on him because I'd rather go out with friends and travel for fun than see my father.  

This year, he found out I have more vacation time with my new job, so he went ahead and bought a ticket for a whole week.  I would have said no to the exact dates, because I don't want to spend a whole week over there, but he bought a non-refundable ticket, so there's not really anything I can do.  I was planning on doing leisure travel with my vacation, but I can't.  

I understand that my family should be more important to me than leisure, and I understand that he just loves me and wants to see me, and we have religious differences that I need to try and respect, but this is getting harder and harder to deal with.  I also understand that it's his house, and I have to follow his rules since I'm a guest, and he can restrict whatever he wants, but I just wish I didn't have to be a guest in his house at all.   He also helped pay for my college, so I owe him, and can't cut him out of my life.  I'd pay him back every penny if it meant I didn't have to put up with this though, but he'll never accept it, so here I am.

Every time I see him, I feel like a child.   I feel like a selfish, immature, teenager.   I hate that feeling.  I literally spent the day crying dreading being in that environment.  I'm an adult.   I have a full time job, my own apartment, a serious relationship, yet I go and instantly I'm 13 and I'm fighting just to go out in something weather appropriate, or at all.

God, that was a long post...

TLDR:  My father uses guilt to get me to visit for longer periods of time than I would like.  He uses my younger half-siblings to guilt me out of going out alone, and dictates how I dress when I'm staying with him.  We have religious differences but I feel that this transcends religion.  I can't tell if I'm in the right, wrong, or if I should just put up with it like I have been, since it's only for a week out of every year.","Is my father controlling, or am I [24F] just oversensitive and/or selfish?",0.0,False,1.0,15.0,1436221322.0,/r/relationships/comments/3ccsou/is_my_father_controlling_or_am_i_24f_just/,NonRomantic
18263,Non-Romantic,3ifqqa,"For the past month, I have been odds with one of my room mates. Let me first give a bit of back story as to how I wound up living with this douche: Up until about a month ago, I had been struggling with getting out of homelessness. I was having difficulty getting a job, due to the poor job market in my city, and every other apartment complex I had looked at were just too expensive. 


My parents had come to an agreement to help pay rent for the first couple months of living somewhere, during which my plan was to get a job. Not too long before my time at the local homeless shelter came to an end, I found someone on craigslist willing to let me move in immediately, as long as I had paid first month rent and deposit. When my Mother and I met with him, all had seemed well. He seemed fairly nice, and was an avid gamer which made me feel comfortable, as I too am a gamer.






For the first several weeks, everything was great. I had a place to live, there was internet, I was no longer bound by the harsh schedule of the shelter. It was fantastic. And to make things better, the room mate in question was spending weeks at a time away from home doing god knows what. I loved it... For a time. But then, not even 3 weeks later, he starts accusing me of making messes (partially true, but I did clean up eventually) and of breaking the oral contract. Which was complete bullshit! Our original oral contract was: I move in after paying first month's rent. During the first couple months, I find a job while also attending college classes. Then he would let me sign the lease.





But then he just said You broke the contract. You were supposed to be on the lease by now. You're the fucking lease holder, dipshit. You were the one responsible for handing it to me to sign. During this, I heard from my mother, who had found out from the management, that he had notified them that he had decided on someone else to have move in, a close personal friend. 3 weeks **after** I was already living here. And now he was accusing me of breaking contract, and was now giving me a week to move out? 


No. My family and I were not having it. It took a while, and several phone calls from my family (which he obviously wasn't a fan of. Your overprotective family is getting on my nerves.

18276,Non-Romantic,3hrya1,"My brother (now sister) came out that she wanted to be a woman about 4 months ago. All of our immediate family knows and truely is very supportive to her. She (then he) was in the hospital for months when she was 12 after trying to kill herself twice. Our family has a large history with depression and anxiety and I myself have quite a bit, but certainly not to the extent of my sister. 

She got through most of high school fine at a school with smaller sized classrooms with a lot less kids in them. But in her senior year(this past year), she decided that she wanted to live with my father which lives about 45 minutes away. Which both parents agreed to do. She skipped school quite often and eventually got a girlfriend [16F]. This girlfriend i feel like has not had a good impact in her life AT ALL. Right before She met this girlfriend, she bought with her own money a big-ass sailboat that my dad agreed to keep on the driveway until the 4th of july weekend for her to work on it easily. He was flne with keeping it longer if he felt there was being progress made on it. And he was willing to help do some of the work too. 

So, back to the girlfriend, she basically took over my sisters life and my sister stopped working on the boat almost completely. My dad once again told her that she would need to find another place for the boat after 4th of july weekend. She didn't like that very much and after getting caught having sex with her girlfriend, left my dads house never intending to return.

She lived with us for about a month with her girlfriend over maybe twice a week. They would just hang down in the basement  and never really interacted with anyone else in the house except for the couple times they both came up to eat dinner with us. 

Then shit started happening. My mom found out they were cutting themselves and drinking alcohol. She, didn't flip out or anything, but locked up every knife or razor she could find along with all the alcohol. My sister had shit (extremely well) hidden though we later found out, as she tried to hang herself with fresh cuts on her neck and wrists. My mom then decided to admit her to a hospital to keep her safe. They only kept her for a week though as they though she was not a risk to herself. 
Well, this monday my mom woke up early to take the dog to the vet, but decided to check on my sister before she left. Upon entering the basement she knew something was wrong because of the smell of shit, piss, and vomit. My sister had taken a ton of pills and washed them all down with vodka. She was not responding to anything my mom did, so my step father called 911 (my mom didn't wan't to, idfk why) She was taken to the emergency room and she was EXTREMELY close to death as she had inhaled her own puke and could not breath. She lived through this all somehow and is now about to be released from the hospital next week as they don't feel she's a threat to herself which in almost everyone else's opinion, is a fucking awful decision. My parents can't control this (i think) because my sister is technically an adult. THis might be the wrong sub and if it is im sorry. Im very scared that she will not survive the next suicide attempts that seem like they will happen. Her girlfriend also tried to kill herself the night before my sister did, making it seem like they planned it. What the fuck can i do to help ensure my sister does not die.

Some comments offered a diferent point of view than mine, which was interesting to read, and some others conforted me or just simply allowed me to see written in a simpler way the things that were rumbling in my head for months, and it made things much clearer.
Yep, the do I have the right to in the title was a bad choice of words. Not exactly what I meant.
Called my friend, explained her how I felt about her bf insisting on the fact that there were opposed to my conceptions, and I felt a kind a danger, but that I trusted her to know what's best for her and that I wish for her to be happy. That I can't pretend to like the boyfriend and do not wish to see him again, but I respect her decision and will be there should she need support.
Seems really easy and could make you wonder why I didn't do that before. But actually putting things down and receiving direct answers from people I have no emotional connection with unlocked something. Thanks !! 



Sorry for the long text, I'm trying not to miss anything. (also, not a native english speaker, so sorry for the mistakes)

My friend, let's call her Blueberry, is dating a new guy that I don't approve of. Not that my friend needs my approval, or that friends are supposed to approve of each other's relathionships. But this guy really bugs me.

Blueberry has a low self esteem, in a great part due to the fact that she dated nice guys but who never really did anything special for her, there was never any passion. « Boring » relationships, roomate relationships, kindof. Except for one guy who left her after two months to get back with his ex ; she gained 60 lbs over loneliness and depression. So, that for the lack of confidence. 

After 6 months of being single after her last relationship, she met that guy. I hated his guts since the first time she told me about him. 

One thing you should know about me is I'm a feminist. I believe in gender equality. I volunteer in a project that helps women who have been victim of domestic violence or rape. That may help you understand my reactions towards that guy.

She met him in a bar, they liked each other. She called me the day after to tell me about him. She had told him that she liked him but was not ready for a relationship, and he had texted her during the night things like Oh come on Blueberry, you're just a woman and I'm a man, you should not resist me or Let yourself go, I know you want it, yep, Robin Thicke style.
Since she asked for my opinion, I had told her to be careful, that it did not sound too good to me. That's all. A few weeks later they were dating. She seemed happy and was losing her extra weight, so I didn't say anything.

I met the guy once, it was also the first time I met my friend since she started dating that guy (we live in different countries). So, first of all, Blueberry had make-up on like a porn star. She used to be a pretty, natural beauty type of girl. I was really shocked. He picked up on my surprise and proudly said that he made her more attractive. We went to a bar to chat. I really tried not to react when he repeatedly called me a brainiac because I have a master's degree, or when he said that reading books was a waste of time, or that since my boyfriend likes shopping he might be gay or a pussy - a little of this kind of things every 5 minutes. At the end, he refused to let me pay my share, arguing that men are the one who should pay for women and that I should use my money for girl stuff. I was so upset at that point I just left.

On the phone, she kept telling me how he was really nice because he never wanted her to lift anything or pay anything, or walk alone in the street, or how he would always have to approve of her outfit before they would go out together, or approve of any outfit she'd buy. According to her, that's a nice thing to do. These kind of things really are in contradiction with my views on gender equality and all, but she seemed so happy, I thought my place was not to interfer at that point, I understand that some people feel happy or more confortable in a dominant/submissive relationship, even if I don't approve of it really, I thought, none of my business. I just told Blueberry that he wasn't my kind of guy because of the macho man thing, when she asked me if I liked him. The guy also has a habit of punching walls when he's upset, which happens a lot, which worries me a little - that part, I have told her. 

All that would have been fine, except that she calls me (about 9 months after they started dating) to ask me, very seriously, if you're allowed to say to your boyfriend that you don't want to have sex with him if you're not in the mood. If you could say no. I said that yes, obviously, you could. She said that's what she used to think too, but her boyfriend thinks different, and he may be right. That he manipulates (her word, not mine) her into having sex with him at least once a day, by being mad when she refuses, then saying then you don't really love me if you don't want to have sex with me, then being upset again, then pretending to cry, etc, until she accepts. I told her that she doesn't owe her borfriend sex and that it was very wrong of him to try to make her guilty and manipulate her like that. She said okay, she'd discuss it with him, because she wasn't sure.

The day after, she calls me back. She says I'm wrong, that it's all about love, that it was CUTE that he would act like that, that it meant he really loved her. She says she doesn't think she's allowed to refuse because she wants to be a good girlfriend, that he explained her that's the way it should be. She said my feminist convictions went to my head and I didn't know what love was anymore. I was upset, I said that having to convince a girl by using her own guilt and compassion (wrong word, but can't find it in english) to have sex with her was pretty close to what the predators who are after date rape would do, and that I don't want to hear anything about her boyfriend again.

That was three months ago, we didn't really talk since, the sended me a few texts, sometimes casual conversation, to which I replied politely, sometimes to tell me I was wrong, to which I don't answer.

Our friendship has been really shattered by all this. But my question is not about the friendship, it's about whether I should do something or not. I find her boyfriend's controlling behaviour dangerous and not healthy. Normally I would think rationnally about matters like that, but the fact that a good friend is involved and my personnal hate for the guy might blur my jugement. I would like, reddit community, to know in your opinion :

a) if his behaviour is 100% not acceptable or if it's actually bad, but not a deal breaker

b) if since she is happy, I can see it, I should try to make her understand that this is not acceptable, that old-fashioned relationships are okay but that this is too far, or not. She is happy, but I tend to think she is in a psychological (hopefully not physical) danger here (but is she ? Or is it just me?), so to what extend am I allowed / should I smash her happiness ? Should I forget about it ? 
At this point I'm not sure we can still be friends ; I'm not trying to win her friendship back, but I want her to be happy, and healthy.

Thanks for reading. Any opinion is appreciated.

18282,Non-Romantic,2t6nlj,"I've been friends with Sally and John now for a few years. They've both always had strange ideas and beliefs, but for the most part it was pretty harmless stuff. Sally is into tarot cards and crystals and John likes to read things like Infowars. Though I personally do not whole heartedly believe in the same stuff, it never bothered me a bit to talk about those things with them when brought up. 


I guess it was in the last couple of months that everything started to get really crazy. I would go visit them and they would show me some youtube documentary about aliens or something, and then John would tell me about all this research he has done where he's found proof of how aliens are trying to harvest our gold to insulate their own planet from it's dying sun. His research would include sketchy conspiracy websites with no real evidence or sources. This spurred both of them into a conspiracy frenzy, and every time I'd see either of them they'd always have a crazy new belief or idea. Things like:

-FEMA is currently manufacturing millions of coffins to hide our bodies in when the apocalypse happens or after alien invasion

-The US government has not only made contact with aliens, but have struck a bargain with them to let them harvest a percentage of our population to keep them from attacking the earth

-The US government is sending out low frequency sound waves all across the world to slowly make us all stupid. It doesn't effect them though because they wear special devices that deflect the sound waves or whatever. 

-The US government is currently building huge underground cities to hide in once the aliens decide to invade, or once the poles switch and the apocalypse happens. (They still haven't quite decided which end of the world scenario they think is going to happen first)

-Aliens walk around among us but they're invisible to all of our senses so we don't know they're there (I asked them that if that was true how does anybody know they're there to write about them, and they both jumped through logical hoops to explain it. I can't remember what they're excuse was but I promise it wasn't convincing)


I could go on and on, their ideas change every day. They were even briefly making plans to try and flee the country to Ireland, but I guess when they discovered how hard that would be they changed their story to that's what **they** want us to do so we've decided to stay.

Thankfully Sally has knocked off talking to me about these things when it's just her and I. I think she got the hint that I wasn't buying it and that it made me uncomfortable, so she doesn't really bring it up anymore. It's only really a problem when I hang out with both of them because John will bring it up on his own and try to talk about it constantly. Sally and I will even try to change the topic but it doesn't stop him from going back to whatever crack pot theory he was talking about. 

It makes me sad because it used to be so much fun to hang out with them but now it's just awkward having to sit and be told that aliens are everywhere and that the government is planning a mass genocide. I have my own conspiracies but this is fucking nuts, and I'm just not sure it's worth maintaining the relationship for.

Backstory: Dad had a great job, mom had a decent job. Financially able to move into a big house. Dad quits jobs for various reasons, buys a business, and starts losing money. Mom making decent money at this point so things are OK for now. I go away to school on loans, oblivious to this financial situation. Mom starts struggling to pay all the bills. Brother starts going to school on loans a few years later and now shes really struggling. Dad finally sells business, but isn't making nearly enough money at new job to significantly help. For some reason they haven't been trying to sell the house they can't afford this whole time (housing market?). Mom divorces dad because they hate each other now and she kinda sees him as dead weight financially. House got put on the market a year ago and finally got sold. We're moving out next month but the family is destroyed.  
Situation now:  
Mom - Her job works her to the bone, and then she has to come home and spend all her money on bills, mortgage payments, interest on loans, etc. Now that the house is being sold she's also trying to sell all the very valuable furniture we can't use. She's clearly very overwhelmed and depressed. She doesn't have many friends or a social life because she's pretty anxious so it seems her only positive outlets are fitness and talking to me and her family.      
Dad - Resents mom for her decision to divorce him during tough times. He works hard too but doesn't make nearly as much money. Because of this he is pretty much absent from all home affairs. He refuses to help pay any more bills or to help sell all this furniture we have, even though he still lives there. He's essentially checked out and moved on with his life even though there is still a lot to be done at home. He's drinking a decent amount now too and spends a lot of free time at the bar. He also seems very depressed.    
Brother - Is back home from school and causing problems. He always wakes up mom in the middle of the night being rowdy with his friends. Then they just scream at each other (mom loses her temper a lot due to all of this frustration) and nothing changes. He does a lot of stuff that makes both my parents angry but he sees no issue with it and continues to be disrespectful. He always says they're overreacting and doesn't see their side. He hates his parents, smokes a lot of weed, and generally doesn't care about anyone's problems, even though he currently lives in the house. I try reasoning with him about it but he's very obstinate and, again, doesn't care about my opinion.  
Me - I feel terrible about this entire situation. Sometimes I feel guilty because I could have went to a cheaper local college and saved money if I had known the financial severity of the situation. But I'm graduating and coming home from school next week, and I want to make the best of an awful situation. Our house is being sold in a month and I'm not sure what's happening next. Hopefully I'll be getting a good job soon to help mom out with some payments. I really just want to help everyone enjoy their lives again by fostering a non-hostile home life (while we still have it) but I have no idea where to begin. It's probably too late at this point, but I wanted to get an outsider's opinion on the situation.

Lory was very young when her parents got a divorce around 5 or 6 and her father practically ran away from her drug using abusive mother. She has lived with her father and step-mom for most of her life, since she was about 13 or so. The step-mom is not very proud of her because she doesn't want to fallow what she wants her to, so she doesn't have any support there and her father is decent but has a tendency to say how much alike her and her abusive mother are. Her father worked many jobs trying to support them through the years and now is established and settled down.

Lory and I have been friends since high school and she often tells me the things her Father says to her and they are not nice but she refuses to believe me and gets defensive. He will say things to her when we go out to drink like Are you drinking again? Your mother was an alcoholic. Or when he found out she has tried weed that Your mother would do that. It isn't even the bad things like that he says to her. He will say things out of the blue like how much alike her and her mom look and then will go on to say how manipulative and abusive she was to him.

This makes me soooo angry because she doesn't, she asks me to read her texts or if something she said sounded mean. She is always worried about being too much like her mother and she tells me how she doesn't want kids because she is afraid she will be like her.

Suddenly feeling much richer from combining my 50k income with his 70k income, fiance has decided to be much more generous to C and her mom SN. Previously they split C's expenses for everything, as SN also makes around 70k. Now fiance wants to prove something by spending lavishly on C. He drops hundreds on fancy branded clothes for a freaking 7 year old who will be outgrowing them in half a year. SN has been happy to take advantage of this by dropping him texts to buy whatever C needs that will cost money, and conveniently forgetting to factor in her half of the costs.

I know how witchy I sound for being selfish with my money this way, I know kids cost money and as his fiancée I should be helping him bear the expenses, but I can't help but feel resentful. We joined incomes to better budget for our household needs as well as save up to build our dream house. But so much of it is flowing towards pampering one child. I mean seriously, a car the moment she turns 16, what are we spoilt billionaires?

I don't know how to deal with this, I just feel guilty. Like he says, it's his kid and he wants her to have the best of everything. I just can't help but think, what about me.

18338,Non-Romantic,38ftsy,"Honestly don't know if my parents are really guilt tripping me or if I just feel guilty.  Maybe I should feel guilty.  Here it goes:

Grandmother lives about 3 hours away, as does the rest of my extended family. Growing up, she was pretty much non-existent since my father and her were not close.  I never really gave it much thought.  Found out that there was some bad blood there since she apparently took off (no idea why) while his father (my grandfather) was in Vietnam, leaving his grandmother (my great grandmother) to do most of the raising for a few years.  I'm not even sure when they officially split, but my dad is much closer to his father.  His mom wasn't completely estranged though...but I don't know the whole story.  

Fast forward to 1980: My parents get married and my grandfather remarries and his wife is who I consider to be my grandmother.  She's accepted all of the kids (grandfather's children as well as future grandchildren) as her own family.  Some time before this, dad's mom got remarried but just kind of adopted her new husband's family as her own and we all became after-thoughts.  This was in play before I was born so I just accepted it as normal.  When ever we'd drive to [home state] to visit family, we passed right by her town without giving it a second thought...for 27 years. 

Fast forward to 2012.  Dad's mom's husband died.  All of a sudden she is back to being involved in everyone's lives and spending time with her children and grandchildren.  And everyone is totally cool with this.  Including my dad.  I even heard my aunt say It's like we got our mom back!...as if she never left. So now whenever there is a family function, I always get the Aren't you going to come by and see (biological) grandmother?  You know she would love to see you.  She might not be around much longer.   If the rest of my immediate family is going to visit her, I just skip that part of the trip and meet up with them elsewhere.  Then I get the same guilt trip on the way home.  Fortunately, I am a grown woman and can chose not to, since I am honestly uncomfortable at her house.  

But...I really just don't care.  No, she has never really done anything wrong to me.  Perhaps the reason she was so distant before was because my dad didn't want to be around her.  Maybe it was something to do with her husband... no one talks about it and I really don't want to discuss it with my parents.  I just have no interest in getting to know a stranger.  

I guess my question is, am I a complete jerk?  Should I make an effort to get to know this woman?

TL;DR:

18339,Non-Romantic,32hmmx,"Fall 2013 I started college. I got to pick my roommate--I went on a roommate matching site and found a girl who seemed a lot like me. Let's call her roommate 1. We moved in to a dorm and were very isolated from all of the other girls in the dorm, since they were all in the same sorority and we weren't interested in Greek life. Since we were so isolated from them and both spent plenty of time in our room, we grew pretty close during the Fall semester. We spent a lot of time watching movies, eating food, and talking about life. 

During Spring 2014 semester, I started to go out more and make more friends. I got a boyfriend and started spending lots of time with him, but it didn't work out. After we broke up she expressed to me that she felt very sad and alone and left out when him and I were together and she got jealous. During the course of that relationship she was cold to me, but not rude. 


As I wasn't spending so much time with her Spring semester, she decided since I got a boyfriend she should, too. She began sleeping around a LOT (2-3 different guys in and out of OUR dorm each week) in order to meet guys. I would be in the room as they had sex, but didn't mind cause I was sleeping. I  was, however, getting pissed off about this because on one or two occasions, she would LEAVE THE STILL-SLEEPING STRANGER HOOKUP IN OUR ROOM WITH ME SLEEPING AS SHE WENT TO MORNING CLASSES. I would have to let them out. I informed her this shouldn't be happening and it never happened again, but she would, without asking me, frequently allow a boy to sleep over that she saw regularly. I didn't so much mind that since I did the same with my boyfriend.


At the same time she started sleeping around, the room was getting more and more trashed. My side was 100% spotless (I described myself as a clean freak on the roommate matching site and she did aa well) but her side was not only cluttered but she left pizza boxes all over the place, dirty dishes for weeks, cups of open yogurt until they smelled, etc. 


Despite these issues, I had signed a lease with her and a friend for the next year. I have been friends with this 2nd roommate (let's call her roommate 2) for 6 years, and she wanted to live with me but didn't know my roommate well. I warned her about how messy and occasionally rude my current roommate can be but she decided to sign anyway.


During Summer of 2014 we both went back to our hometowns and didn't see each other. When we moved into a new place for Fall 2014, I began dating our neighbor. He is a bodybuilder and very charming. Just like before, Roommate 1 started to act cold to me but this time she started to act bitchier than when I dated the first guy. She told me she could see my boyfriend getting violent since he is very muscular, she said it was disgusting to date someone with a face like that, etc. etc. Roommate 2 had no problem with Boyfriend. 

Since we are neighbors, Boyfriend came over a lot. Roommate 1 was irate about this but refused to tell me. I know she was mad about it since she started to slam the door to her room when ever he was around and whenever Boyfriend talked or said anything she would roll her eyes or say something rude about him. Meanwhile, Roommate 2 brought over her boyfriend frequently and Roommate 1 didn't care. 


At one point, I went on a weekend vacation with a girlfriend. My phone died at one point, and Boyfriend thought Roommate 1 might have the friend's number who I was vacationing with. He said he went over to my apartment and Roommate 1 was all over him. He said she invited him inside, was very flirtation, and told him to come over anytime despite disliking me having him there frequently.


Two weeks after that indicent (3 weeks after Boyfriend and I become official), Roommate 1 gets a boyfriend (Boyfriend 2) of her very own! Before Boyfriend and I started dating she told me that this man (her distant friend of 5 years) asked her out but she told him no since she thinks he is ugly, he lives 3 hours away, and she doesn't see him as smart or funny or anyone she could see a future with. Well, 3 weeks after Boyfriend and I start spending lots of time together, she drives to where Boyfriend 2 lives, takes his virginity, he asks her out again, and she says yes. 


Things got worse from then on. She started telling me I looked too skinny and would make seriously caloric desserts that I didn't ask for and put them out for me to eat (specifically, with my name on it only.) She also started leaving lots of dishes and food around the apartment which gave us roaches. Meanwhile she would have spouts of passive aggressive bitchyness, seemingly brought on by nothing. She would also demand that Roomate 2 and I spend time with her but would then Skype Boyfriend 2 the entire time , often going into her room and lock the door to talk to him, even during Roommate 3's birthday celebration that she insisted on being a part of. She also humiliates and makes fun of her boyfriend in front of us--he'll make a joke over Skype and she'll be like why do you even try you are not funny why do you make me look stupid in front of my friends. It gets incredibly awkward.


By this time, Fall 2014 semester is ending and I'm fed up. I move in with Boyfriend but it isn't far away since we are neighbors. In an effort to make peace with Roommate 1, I left all the things I bought for communal use at their apartment. This didn't help. I stopped spending time over there in most capacities but I did leave many of my things there that are not used on a regular basis.  Roommate 1 and 2 become best friends when I move out. They both spend the entire day on the couch smoking pot, skipping classes, and ordering Dominos. Roommate 1 continually ask me to have girls night with her at the apartment but when I do all she does is talk to Roommate 2 and ignore me or Skype Boyfriend 2 and ignore me. 


Due to the pot-smoking and the class-skipping, Roommate 1's GPA falls to the point where she is kicked out of her major. She doesn't tell me this, Roommate 3 does.  In Fall 2015, Boyfriend is going to law school and I nursing school so we are going where we both are accepted. On one of our monthly girl's nights I mentioned Boyfriend was accepted to a University near where her boyfriend lives and I was accepted at the University her boyfriend attends.  


Less than a week later, she tells me that she applied to the same University as Boyfriend 2 and got in. This ASTOUNDS me, since she told me she hates that school, hates the city, etc. She also tells me that she isn't moving in with him but is moving near him. She tells me she's so happy that we'll be close to each other still, and I tell her that it's not a for sure deal that Boyfriend and I will be going to that area for Fall 2015. She said she knows, but is for SURE moving. She even signed a lease!! Within a month she went from Fuck that University to I want to go to that University to I'm so sure I want to go there I signed a lease there 4 months before I move in. To make matters go from bad to worse, I run into Roommate 3. She tells me Roommate 1 has signed leases for Fall 2015-Spring 2016 in the city we currently live in AND the city she is now moving to. She is taking out a loan to cover the cost of the apartment in our current city instead of breaking the lease for cheap, an offer than was extended to her. Call me crazy, but I truly feel like she is keeping both apartments available so that she can have a place near me no matter where I go to University. 


What triggered this post was Boyfriend and I came into my old apartment (Roommate 1's and 2's current apartment) and noticed that medication had been mis-mailed to us. Roommate 1 didn't care when I picked up the package to look at it, but when I showed it to Boyfriend to see if he knew the name on the package (we assumed it could've been someone in the complex who meant to receive it) she started screaming at us that what we are doing is a federal crime, what if we tear the packaging, etc. and snatches the package from his hands before storming off to her room and throwing the package on the floor. We just left. 

I'd really like some advice about how to deal with this situation. I am a very submissive, meek people-pleaser which I am working on. I am wondering if, from an outsider's perspective, this is normal roommate/friend behavior that I am blowing out of proportion. Am I crazy for thinking she's paying for two apartments to be near me?

During the last year, I moved to China to teach English. Unfortunately, one of my friends, whom I have made every effort to keep in touch with, just doesn't make any effort to reply to my messages. I understand being busy---trust me. Between teaching hours and tutoring hours, I work more hours than you can shake a stick at. Somehow, I still manage to make the effort to shoot her an email or facebook message. Whenever I am lucky and catch her online and say something, she always says, I'm busy. Gotta go.

When I finally confronted her about her behavior, she told me that she was mad about me moving to China. We talked about it, I thought that everything was going to go back to normal. But she still isn't replying to my messages. And now, the wedding talk is back on and I don't really want her to be a bridesmaid anymore. I want to replace her with someone who makes me feel like they care as much about our friendship as I do.  

I want to continue being friends with her and I really don't want to hurt her feelings. But when it comes time for my wedding, I don't want her up there with me. Is there any way I can let her down easily? Or should I just keep her with everyone else and hope that our friendship goes back to normal when I'm done teaching in China next year?

I can see she is afraid of getting to know other people and isn't able to self-disclose or show interest in other people. When I talk to her I have to uphold the conversation almost single handedly and it never gets deeper just prolonged variations of:




Her: How are you? Me: I'm great, how are you? Her: Yeah, good thanks. Me: errmmm How is work? Her: Yeah, its busy, can't wait until it's over. Me: Ah that sounds annyoing. Hope your day gets better :) Her:Thanks - tbh my life kinda sucks. I don't think I will ever fulfil my dreams. FML.




She's also an extremely pessimistic person. She wants to be a film director but really doesn't try to achieve this and then she gets depressed about how her life isn't what she wants it to be. I know that sounds judgemental, though let me explain a little further.




She wants to direct films, though barely watches any cinema, reads any film theory, discusses with any deep reflection about her topic. She also switches between film director/comic book artist/jewellery maker/greeting card designer. She tries half-heartedly at all of these things, which no research or connecting with others.




On a personal level she also disturbs me, she is quite enamoured with childhood things like My Little Pony and all things cute (nothing wrong with that in itself of course). This obsession started when she got with her boyfriend, who has become almost like a substitute father (her parents are divorced and she's really cut up about it still, especially her father not being that interested in her). So she regresses into all of this childhood paraphenailia which my friend reinforces and buys her more of, and tells her how cute she is etc. Really disturbs me!




Anyway, she writes me letters on all of this cute-print letter paper with stickers etc. At first I was polite like 'Oh that's cute!' etc. I'm much more a marilyn manson/gothic literature type of person. I replied to a few of these letters, though I feel like I'm the only person in her life and these shallow interactions where I have to pretend to like cute stuff etc. because she can't encompass other people's different identities is really wearing me out now.




I feel awful to say these things. I did it originally to help out my male friend, though he's a bit mean of lately. Saying stuff like 'You're not actually that pretty and 'I couldn't be bothered to read what you sent tbh' etc.

Edit 2: I have no issue with her being different from me, liking different things, or with liking cute stuff though in the context of her relationship I find it disturbing. I started out by making polite comments about her interest in cute stuff now it's the thing she clings to between us and I have to keep pretending. That's my own fault I know - I'm asking how to get out of the situation without hurting her/creating more feelings of abandonment rejection etc.

For the sake of everyone I will be changing their names. The mom,50 years old, is now called Abby. The little girl,8 years old, is now called Lucy. The dad, 53 years old, is now called Tony.
We became friends because our daughters attend school together.


So, a week ago Abby came to me telling me that Lucy tried killing herself the night before. I asked Lucy if she called the Crisis Center, which she had not. She said that Lucy had an appointment after the kids get out of school to see someone. I told her to let me know how it goes. Now Lucy's mental health has been questioned in the pass. Abby wanted me to talk to Lucy a few months ago, after Lucy threw a rock through the window. When I talked to Lucy she told me the voices in her head told her to do that. When I said something to Abby about the voices, she told me that she already knew about the voices, as she says this anytime she does something that she might get into trouble.


So, the day after Abby told me that Lucy was trying to kill herself, I asked Lucy how her appointment went. Lucy looked at me confused and told me she had no appointment. When I dropped Lucy off after school. I went and talked to Abby. Asking what happened to the appointment, her answer was Well we don't feel like she needs to see someone. I begged her for a few days to please take Lucy to see someone. This is not normal for an 8 year to want to kill herself, to hear voices in her head. Finally they agreed, after I went ahead and made an appointment. I took them and sat out in the waiting room. The doctor talked to Abby, Tony and Lucy separate. 


Today, Abby handed me the report. She was like The lady is a crazy. So, I read the report. I started crying after reading the report. It is basically written out to sound like Lucy either has been or is getting abused. She told the doctor,the voice she created a few months ago, and then I had an Oh shit moment. A few months ago, when I went over to their apartment to drop off something, I saw Lucy, her arm was wrapped, I asked Abby what happened, she told me Lucy fell off her bike and I think she broke her arm. Sure enough after begging Abby, I was able to take Lucy to the hospital and come to find out yes, Lucy's arm was broken. Then I started thinking of all the time when Lucy would come over crying and when I asked her what happened she would tell me that Mommy and Daddy are fighting again. 


So, now I am going insane, trying to see if there are any another signs of abuse. Is there even any abuse? I mean it really sounds like there is. I know that Abby is depressed and Tony is Bi-Polar. I know that neither of them our on their medicine. Is it possible? Well, I know it is. But what do I do now? 

   
**tl;dr**: 8 year old hears voices that tell her to do 'bad' things, I had to beg parents to take their child to the doctor. I think there is possible abuse happening.

Thank you to the people who have comment or PM me with advice. I would like to address the not-so nice PM: I wrote this right after I got done reading the report.

We called CPS. They are looking into it. My husband and I have agreed that even if they don't find anything, we will remain in Lucy's life. We are the reason why she has new clothes, shoes and gets to vist the doctor. We understand she is not our child, however she is a child. We also plan to get her to understand our home is a safe home, that we are there for her if she needs us.

18352,Non-Romantic,2vd0on,"I'm living with a two other guys from my hometown in a really great location a couple thousand miles away from where we grew up. I moved out here about 6 months ago, and was glad to be able to start off with a little network of friends that I already knew. We're all around 30. I've been pretty good friends with one of the guys, Jack, since way back in the day. The other guy, Chase, I didn't really know back home, but Chase and Jack are good friends and we all get along well.

Okay, so things have been going well, and in December, Chase asked us if his younger brother  (Charles, 29/m) could stay with us for a bit while he got on his feet and looked for a job and his own place to live in this little piece of paradise we're in. Of course we were happy for him to do that -- we've got a good amount of space in a nice house and are more than happy to help out friends when we can. When I graduated from college, my older brother put me up for a few weeks while he was living with a couple other guys, and I couldn't have been more grateful that he did that, and it was a huge help to me.

Well it's now been almost 2 months that he's been with us, and as far as I know, he's made no progress with finding a job or place of his own. He's exhausted the savings that he had, and works at a low-paying job on the weekends to have some cash to get by. I work from home, and so while I have no desire or intention to monitor his daily affairs, I can't help but see how he's spending his days since he lives in a common area (living room) right next to the kitchen. And he is just straight up wasting his time. I think he does spend maybe an hour or so a day working on looking for a job (like I said, I'm not monitoring him, this is just my estimate from passing by casually throughout the day over the past couple months). But otherwise, he is playing computer games and watching shitty reality TV (it's on like 100% of the time during the day, sometimes in the background while he's at his computer, and sometimes he'll be actively watching on the couch). He also goes for a run most days, and does some other things, but overall, he is just getting *nothing* done!

We're all concerned for him, and he has a very mellow demeanor, but he always frames things like he's the victim (I mean that in general, but a specific example is when Chase (his brother) talked to him once about what his plans were, he exploded like Oh of course, you're going to kick me out! And then I'll be homeless! No, that's fine, I'll figure something out, don't you worry about me.) He talks like everyone else around him is an idiot, and he's dealing with their shit. Chase helped him get a good job 4 or 5 years ago, and he eventually quit last year because he couldn't stand the people there. And then he lived at his parents house doing nothing until he moved in with us in December.

Anyway, I think he's really depressed, and not sure how we can help him, but right now it feels like we're enabling him to get away with doing nothing. In an effort to help him get a job, I talked with him for a while about looking for jobs and offered to help him out with tailoring his resume, and asked him to send me his resume and a couple job postings that he's potentially interested in. I explained to him my qualifications (currently in a manager role at a software company, have been part of the hiring process for new recruits, and have generally been successful with finding jobs), and was completely sincere in my offer. He thanked me and was grateful for the offer, and said that he would, but its been two or three weeks and he hasn't sent me his resume or any job postings! (He also told me that his mom wrote his resume for him, and he's not even really sure what it says! Wait, WHAT?!? It's almost like he's actively trying to *not* get a job!! But then of course blames it on everything/one else, his circumstances, etc.)

A couple other things: when he first moved out here, I asked him out of curiosity what kind of jobs he's looking for, and his response was something easy where I don't have to do a lot of work (that was pretty much the first red flag that this wasn't going to go very well for him). He's commented that he has an addictive personality, and he continues to smoke pot even though it's severely limiting the range of prospective jobs for him. He's made comments like don't you hate it when your horoscope says something about your marriage, that doesn't even apply to me! and I've seen him spreading out tarot cards on the coffee table. If confronted I suspect that he would say that it's just for entertainment and doesn't take that stuff seriously, but to me that aligns with his victim mentality and is just another flag that he thinks his life is controlled by fate and is another way to deny responsibility for his own lack of action. Also, overall, he's not taking up a ton of space, but he sleeps on our couch in the living room (the only common area with a couch/tv), and goes to bed by 9pm. And while theoretically, we've decided that since he's not paying rent, that shouldn't stop us from hanging out occasionally (none of us are big into tv so its not a big deal anyway), in actuality, it's very awkward to hang out in the living room when there's a sleeping person there.

We're at the point where we clearly need to lay down some ground rules and guidelines (which we probably should have done long ago). But I'm not sure what those should be, none of us want to start acting like a grown man's parent. Do we ban him from watching tv? I'm the one home during the day, and that's going to make working during the day uncomfortable as hell, I've got a job to do and can't be worried about checking in on this guy. Ban him from smoking pot? That's not really feasible I don't think. Tell him that he has exactly one more month to get his shit together and move out? And then what? Charles will literally be homeless with no way to support himself and Chase will have to explain everything to his parents (who from the few anecdotes I've heard sound kind of crazy themselves), and create a hurricane of drama in his life. Chase is really stressed and feels guilty that he brought this on to us, and feels totally boxed in by the situation.

However, I promised I'd get him a 980 which costs roughly $500. My other friend has the 970 (which is better than 770 but worse than 980), and he got it for extremely cheap like $250, so I figured the 980 would be just a tad more like $300-$330. I told my friend that I would give him the 980 and he would give me his 770. His Christmas present would essentially be an upgrade. **At this point he says he'll have to up my gift if I'm doing that**.

Here's the problem. Turns out the 980 isn't $300-$330. It's more like $500 and I just don't have enough to buy it. My budget was like $300-ish. I didn't know they were this expensive. So I looked for the one just below that and it's the 970, which is $300-$330. I'm going to get him that one, which is much better than his, but not as dramatically as the 980 is. So my upgrade is still an upgrade, just not as amazing. 

I'm worried though because I told my friend I was getting him the 980 and I only now realized I can only afford the 970. And because I said 980, he said he made my gift way better. What's worse is that he said he already received my gift in the mail (which is a 1080p computer monitor from what I've gathered off hints from friends) so if I take it back he's going to get mad. 

I don't know what to do. Do I just get him the 970 and hope he forgets? It's basically the second best one on the market. I fucked up so hard.

18382,Non-Romantic,2dtwg6,"Don't know how long this will be as this is the first time I am ever writing/talking about this. You can skip further down to my actual questions if you want.

I live at home with my mother and father. We live in a duplex and my grandmother lives in the other apartment. My grandfather and grandmother moved in with us about 15 years ago but my grandfather passed away a little over a decade ago so it's just been her. She was put on antidepressants to help with losing my grandfather - she is still on them today.

We use to have a great relationship between all of us but that has been declining the past decade. I believe it may be due to mental illness or some sort of dementia. The past 3 or 4 years have been rough. There are days when she is normal and acts like a decent human being but then there are days when she is all out nasty.

She lives downstairs and believes she can hear us up here talking about her (it's always about something negative) - this happens regularly and when she tells us we usually just brush it off and tell her it is impossible to hear that. Either way, we do not spend all day talking shit about her. She is also constantly making very nasty remarks to my mother and they get into fighting but she never actually seems to realize that any of the stuff she says is hurtful. She does not drive so we all help out to get her groceries and take her to the doctor. She is very ungrateful about this and seems to not realize we are doing her all these favors.

This is sucks obviously but we have put up with it for years so I guess we got use to it.

Starting this past year though, it is starting to get more serious. She has started misplacing things around her apartment and once it has gone missing, she immediately lashes out at us accusing us of stealing them. **We have never stolen a thing from her** Most of the time it is small things like a spatula or toilet paper (cause, you know, we are really hurting for toilet paper lol). But now it is getting worse, she hoards money around her place and has started misplacing that. Last year she misplaced a hundred in rolled up quarters. That was a huge deal and she accused every single one of us of stealing them. Even going to say she could hear us talking upstairs about stealing them. We tried everything to convince her that we did not do that, and how it is almost literally impossible for us to if we wanted. She doesn't go out much and she is always in her apartment with the door locked. Eventually she found the quarters and we thought that was that. She did not apologize or even acknowledge that she was wrong. Now this is where it gets weird -- a couple days after this is over, she misplaces the quarters again and we go through the whole fighting and accusations again. She finds them once again. **She then goes and misplaces them a third time** - after finding them yet again, my mother is furious and drives her down to the bank to deposit them.

Then finally a couple days ago was the final straw. She accuses my mother and I of stealing some amount of cash from her apartment. We do not know how much money she even has down there or its location. We sigh and assume she will find it and it will blow over again. It does not. She calls the police and gets them involved. They show up at our house and take a report from her. She explains everything (according to her reality I guess) and they leave. They do not stay and talk with us. My mother calls her after and is furious. She asks what they talked about and my grandmother says she told them how my mother is always yelling and cursing at her, how badly she treats her and so on. My mother is now a wreck and is afraid my grandmother will get it in her head that we are abusing her. I realize that abuse of the elderly is a real thing and police need to take it seriously. My grandmother would not lie about this outright but I fear she may convince herself it is a thing.

So this has been weighing a lot on me. We have some extended family that are aware of the problem so we have some support. Others only see her maybe one day a year so they are oblivious. My mother tried talking with her doctor but he said he can't get involved in family disputes? She is going to see him tomorrow to have a much more serious conversation.

Bottom line is I and we want her out of the house. I am done having any interaction with her until she gets help or leaves. This makes me feel terrible obviously, I know it is probably some mental condition that is making her act like this but I have had enough these past years. I have no experience with this and it is really taking its toll on me. I feel like a total ass feeling this way about my grandmother. I had plans to move out soon but I do not want to leave my mother alone here with her.

**Questions**

So, my questions.

We do not want any contact with her anymore. At least as much as humanly possible while living in the same house. She does not drive at all so we are the only way she gets to the doctors and gets groceries. Are we under any legal obligation to do those things for her? We have services around here that would deliver groceries and she can always call a cab to get around.

Can we demand and make her seek out help for any mental issues she may have?

Finally, if it comes to it. Can we force her to move out? Either into a home or maybe some other relative. She is not on the mortgage and clearly has a claim to live here (she's been here almost 20 years).

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

18384,Non-Romantic,2x6h9b,"**Some background information before I go into the big problems:** my fiancé and his sister have always been really close. Their parents went through a messy divorce and so they were always there for each other. When I first met him and we started dating, they used to text constantly and talk on the phone almost daily. This got under my skin a bit, as I would have to drive 40 minutes to see him and often times he would spend the majority of the time texting or on the phone with her. It got to a point where I would be really sad over petty things like him watching a movie with her that he promised to see with me.

Eventually we moved in together, became much more serious, and we talked about how sometimes it hurt my feelings that I felt second place to his sister constantly. He was very understanding and started texting her only a few times a day and phone calls once a week or so.


**Moving on to the big problems that have me hating her:** Last May, we got engaged and also found out we were expecting the same month. While it would have been nice to have been married first, we were beyond happy.  We each loved our jobs, had a wonderful place to raise the baby, and were to be married in October with baby due in January.  Our family was very supportive and so happy for us both.  

Once his sister found out, she started pointing out how now she had baby fever and how she was so excited to buy things for our baby.  She kept going on how she couldn't wait to have her own baby and would just have to spoil ours in the mean time.  (This was her first time being an Aunt, so I understand how exciting that can be, but the baby fever thing really just struck a nerve.)

**(Trigger: babyloss)** Everything was going great until September.  I woke up one night bleeding and we rushed to the hospital.  We found out that I have something called an Incompetent Cervix and that I was fully dilated. At 22 weeks, my daughter was born, and due to under-developed lungs, only survived a short while.  Obviously this was a life changing moment for us.  Our daughter passed away in our arms and there was nothing anyone could do to console us.  I was unable to even bring myself out of bed for the first week or so.

For obvious reasons, my fiance and I decided to postpone our wedding.  Come THE DAY OF OUR ORIGINALLY PLANNED WEDDING, his sister calls him to announce that she is pregnant and that she conceived her baby the week our daughter passed away.  She didn't say it with any remorse, just full happiness and excitement. I was/am completely devastated.

Essentially, this is why I now just absolutely hate her.  I cant for the life of me bring myself to be happy for her.  She decided to start trying because she had baby fever. Even if we hadn't lost our daughter, it bothers me that she couldn't have waited for us to have our baby and wedding before she started trying, and then to call us on that day to announce it was just completely rude.  I now find myself crying multiple times a day when I think of her and her pregnancy.

So now, not only do I hate my soon-to-be SIL, but I am finding myself resenting my fiance because he still talks to her about every other day, asking to see pictures of the ultrasounds, talking to her about movies, and overall just being a supportive brother.  I know I shouldn't resent him for this, but I do.  I feel like I am alone in this and do not know how to approach it without sounding crazy. I would never ask my fiance to cut ties with anyone, or be rude or anything, but I wouldn't mind if he told that what she did was really hurtful and it should have been carried out in a better way.  Plus, I will have to see her for family functions, and the baby shower of the next few months and I dont know how to approach this?  Should I politely decline going?  Should I tell her how I feel even though she isn't my sister?


**TL;DR:** My soon-to-be SIL got baby fever while I was pregnant and ended up conceiving the week I lost my daughter, then told us on the day that was our originally scheduled wedding date.  I hate her and am scared to see her and I am also becoming resentful of my fiance.

I share a house with three other people, my older brother 'Aaron' [23M], a girl named 'Jess' [19F], and 'Mary' [21F]. The lease is in my mothers name. My mother had previously lived here, I lost my job and my mum wanted to move to another state, so she made a deal with me, she would cover the cost of bills until I got back on my feet, and I would cover rent so she has somewhere to live when she comes back in 12 months time.



Mary moved in because she had no where to go, and it kept a roof over my head as I wouldn't have been able to afford rent on my own. Mary and I were in the house alone for a few months after my mother left. It was fair and we got along well. Her attitude has completely changed since Jess has moved in. She's acting very 'Queen Bee' and we're all completely over it, shes become manipulative, controlling and quite hypocritical.

*At the start we had agreed we would put a set amount of grocery money together every fortnight so we could have meals together. I was fine with this until Mary decided she would have her boyfriend stay 4 nights a week free of charge. I told her I'm no longer paying to feed her boyfriend, so if she needs to do that she can sort out that for herself and buy seperate meals for them. That was fine, however I've noticed she hasn't been doing that lately. All the food they have been eating has been paid for by everyone else, because she has failed to put in for communal (for lack of a better word) food.

*90% of the time she walks around in a shitty mood and gives everyone greasy looks, but insists that its everyone else that has a problem. She makes snide remarks about about how little housework everyone's done. She insists that she is the only person that does anything, however I clean up after myself and my brother because no one else should have to do that.

*Everything I do has to be approved or decided by her, what I eat and at what times, how many hours per day im expected to put into housework, what time is acceptable to shower so I don't 'inconvenience' anyone else, how loud my tv is at night. What time I should be going to bed because 'we' have to get up early and clean up before she has other plans. Where my money must go down to every detail. Its even gotten to the point where I'm not able to leave the house without her asking where I'm going, who I'll be with and what time I'll be home. Also, if I'm out seeing a male she doesn't know, she thinks its ok for her to expect me to give me his number in case something happens to me. I appreciate the concern but I'm not comfortable with that.

*She has a major problem with my brother. She bitches to him constantly about his xbox being too loud for Jess to sleep. It isn't. I've sat with him often and i can barely hear it from the couch. He wears headphones at night when watching movies and is too afraid to play music during the day because he doesnt want to fuel the problem. She is the LOUDEST person I have ever met. Her and her boyfriend sit up every single night until ~4am laughing and screaming at the top of their lungs, and when asked to keep it down, it lasts for 20 minutes max before we're all woken up again. If anyone else was to do that, they would be abused in the hallway like I was when I accidently dropped my house key when I came home late saturday night. Your house key needs to be quiet.
What?

*Since Jess has moved in, she's completely dropped me. The only times she has spoken to me is when she either needs a lift somewhere, wants to borrow something or is telling me to do something.

*If I walk into a room she and Jess are talking in, she will stop talking or continue talking in whispers, completely ignoring me. It makes me feel like I'm being ganged up on.

*She hands out my wi-fi password to all her friends, even when I have asked her multiple times not to because she doesn't pay for it. She is constantly on youtube or streaming things, making the internet too slow for anyone else to use. I've asked her to consider that and she has not.

*She is always moving things around in the house that belong to my mother, dumping them in boxes for me to deal with. I don't think she has the right to do that.

*I recently found out her mother is under the impression that she is paying bills, which she is not. She pays her equal share of rent and that is it. I don't know why she would not tell her mother that, seems sus.

 


I do not do confrontation at all, and its dawned on me that that has been taken advantage of. I don't know how to approach her and voice my concerns without this being turned around on me. I feel used and walked all over, but it happened so sneakily over a long period of time that I didn't realize until it was too late. I'm not happy living like this and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells in my own home.

 I've told her we need to talk tonight when Jess gets home from work, however I don't even know what to say. I'd like to start doing my own groceries, and living my own life, and having her pay towards bills. How do I go about building a back bone without throwing away what was once a great friendship? Is it even worth saving? What boundaries do I need to set in place here? I cannot handle 'The Mary Show' anymore and she needs to understand that she doesn't run this household and everyone in it.

So I understand that I don't have the experience of raising kids to really have authority on the subject, but I am still very concerned.

I would not describe my friend's marriage as a happy one. They are always fighting about every little thing that comes up, and his wife is particularly offensive in how she treats him, what with name calling and constant put-downs. The big problem is that they do all this right in front of the kids, and as someone who has been involved in the lives of their entire family since it began, I can see a very obvious mimicking by the kids of their parents. The oldest, who is a girl, will yell at her brothers in the exact same way that she sees her mom dealing with my friend. The middle one who is a boy is very shy and timid, which is what he sees in his dad. The youngest is 2 years old so he doesn't have a particular personality formed yet, but I am concerned for the future.

My friend and his wife yell at each other in front of the kids, name-call, and even air their disagreements on how to raise their kids right there in front of them as they are listening. A particular instance happened yesterday when my friend was telling two of his kids that they had had enough screen time for the day, at which point his wife started yelling from the other room, eventually coming into the room we were in and yelling at him about how she had told them already that they could play on screens for the evening, and he was not to get in the way of her raising her kids. 

Here's the deal. The last time I interjected about something of this nature, I got slammed down as not understanding relationships, and the result was my friend no longer telling me the issues that bother him about his relationship (this also happened in conjunction with them beginning therapy, so it is likely the therapist told him to stop). I don't want to get further cut off or overstep my bounds, but this really bothers me that their kids are going to grow up thinking this type of relationship is normal, and will then continue to perpetuate this toxic style.

Background: 

Just moved to a new city with girlfriend for work. Got a decent rate for a month temporary stay at a bnb.

I've been working hard and saving money to travel this 2015 winter/spring, hopefully January to March. I have never traveled anywhere outside of the US besides a big group tour to Korea when I was 12. This trip would be entirely financed by my boyfriend and me. Previously, we saved money and traveled to San Francisco together.

My boyfriend is white (which makes them a little uncomfortable) also non-religious. He is an experienced traveler; he's been to 29 countries both with and without his parents. He's very involved in planning routes/flights/sights and is street smart. His parents know we plan on going somewhere and have given us their approval.

I haven't even proposed a time frame, budget, or destination to my parents. All I did was tell my mother (not my dad) that I'm saving some money to travel next year. She immediately shut me down and said no when I said I would go with my boyfriend. The thing is, without any details on the trip itself, I'm pretty sure she's shutting me down because *she thinks we're going to have sex*. Not because it's dangerous, or expensive, or time-intensive. She said SF was okay because we stayed at his sister's home for two nights out of the six.

Two days later, I sat her down and tried to convince her gently and logically why I wanted to go. I gave her the usual arguments about taking a trip in college: future opportunities, the lack of time to travel in my future, and the sheer number of students who choose to travel at my age safely. I told her I would be safer with my boyfriend, who has experience traveling alone abroad, than with just about anyone. She didn't care and wouldn't give me an actual reason for saying no.

How can I talk to my mom about this? My dad is usually more logical than her, but he's also more protective. He can usually sway my mom's opinion, but if he says no it's over.

And to be perfectly clear: I am sexually active with my boyfriend, but I've been on birth control for over a year. My parents don't know, but his do and think it's okay.

18420,Non-Romantic,20rhg7,"Okay, so this is a long story so I'm going to shorten some parts.

I am having a 16th birthday party in a few months, big thing, birthday court, the whole shebang and at first I was apprehensive but I've warmed up to the idea. 

I need to start at the beginning and say I went to the hospital while my friend Sylvia was at my house and after telling her to stay home she insisted on coming with me. So we didn't get back home until around 4AM and we told her we would take her to school in the morning. Then she didn't want to go so we told her we would take her when my mom got back from picking up my grandmother. Then Sylvia called her mother who got angry and we took the both of us to school. This prompted a fight between our mothers which was very contradicting. 
Sylvia was going to be in my birthday court but told me she couldn't make any practices on Sundays. As far as we knew those were the only days open so I asked if she could make it work, which she said she could.

Her mother, who we will name Molly, was still mad at my mother and got angry at this and texted me harassing me and saying things like how I'm disrespectful and telling me to go have sex with my boyfriend.
So I told Sylvia that I couldn't have her in my party due to the 3+ hours I had to spend fighting her mother. She said that would be best and I thought we were fine. 

So we had a rehearsal this past Sunday and it went well, and we found out my instructor had a day open on Friday. Sylvia had caught wind of this and got angry that there was a rehearsal on Friday. Keep in mind that she is no longer a part of this. She got angry that I kicked her out and called me a bitch. I didn't really mind at this point.

We had a class together but today she dropped it. I called my mom on the bus to the bowling alley to tell her about Sylvia dropping the class and my friend Madeline and I were talking about it. Her ex boyfriend who is still her friend was eavesdropping apparently and told Sylvia we were talking a bunch of shit and she texted me and told me to keep her name out of my mouth or she will lay my ass out and that is not a threat it is a promise.

Now what? I'm taking all of these messages to the school office tomorrow morning because she can get into trouble for threatening me and her mother can for harassment.

Am I overreacting? Underreacting? Is there anything else I should do?

Am I in the wrong? I don't feel like I am but maybe I'm just having tunnel vision.

18429,Non-Romantic,2rpog8,"I had never known until a few years ago that my father had had a previous marriage. I found out while mindlessly googling my name and running across one of those ancestry sites. When I asked him about it, he told me that it was just someone he used to know, but further searching on google brought up the owner history of a house with both of their names on it, whose settlement didn't go through until after I was born.

I also didn't find out about my mother's previous marriage until a few months ago from some distant family members who weren't aware that it was a big secret while attending a cousin's wedding. According to those family members, she left him for my father. I believe it - my mother didn't marry her father until she was about 32, and in the country I'm from it's abnormal if you get married after 25, so it makes sense that she would have been married prior to that even if it was just because the family pushed her to it. Those family members said that they were not entirely sure if she had children in her previous marriage or not, but that she had been married for 7 years so it was likely.

My younger sister recently found out the same information about my father through the same thing - a family ancestry website while doing research for a school project. She was really upset and talked to me about it, and I assured her that divorce is normal and nothing to be weirded out about. However, we both are really confused about why they had to lie to us about - and continue to do so. 

Is this something I should be upset about? Like I said, I know divorce is normal - isn't the divorce rate in the US something like 50%? I'm just really confused about why neither of them will STILL not acknowledge the truth. 

In addition to all this, I also found out that they lied about their anniversary date to be a year earlier than it actually was so that I wouldn't know that they were married months after I was conceived. Like I said, I feel this is pretty normal in today's society, and I don't know why they would go to such lengths to lie about it.

I want to get them to acknowledge these things but I don't know if it's worth it. How do I talk to them about this, especially my mother's potential for having other children?

18443,Non-Romantic,2t88i8,"Hi Reddit, I love this sub and I could use some advice. I've been an anxious person for as long as I can remember, and for as long as I can remember it's kept me from reaching my potential. At first it was just problems with procrastination and half-assing (who cares if you do badly if you didn't try) but as I got older it got more serious. My parents kind of coddled me as a child and my fragile self-worth was based on their love and praise. I was scared to try things and prove them wrong and feel like a failure.

High school was ok. University was not. It took me 6 years to complete a 3 year degree. I got counselling on and off. I learned Cognitive Behavioral Therapy methods which would help for a while but I would inevitably discontinue them because they're boring and uncomfortable. I would miss class, hand things in late (really late, weeks late) and just generally feel shitty about it all. I can't think back on this time without deep, deep shame. My second last year I lied about attending period, they thought I was enrolled and I wasn't. When I finally came clean they were naturally shocked and upset. That year was also when I became a daily pot smoker. 

Since university it's been about a year and a half of terrible temp jobs and a looot of pot, alcohol and party drugs. I had also been working on a certification to teach english abroad but I was way too anxious to go. This past Christmas I fucked up badly, we went on a family vacation and I brought along some party drugs. It didn't go as planned and it wasn't fun or worth it. But someone I had offered some to contacted my family and let them know what was up. That was when they realized things were pretty bad. 

My incredibly sweet, supportive, loving family is going to help me get the counselling I need. They're helping me spend a few more months here getting experience tutoring english and learning the skills to manage my anxiety so I don't turn to drugs. 

So my questions: how can I thank them? How can I do my best to make sure I don't mess up? How can I repair the trust in our relationship? How can I learn to trust myself? What kind of therapist should I look for? What should I discuss with my GP?

18455,Non-Romantic,2ucseo,"Okay… I apologise straight up - this will be long… could really use some advice…  
  
I've been living by myself for the past year and a half or so. I actually love living alone most of the time, but last year, through winter, I really struggled with it. It was probably also because I was doing shift work and had no social life… ended up having a major depression relapse, so I thought that, if the right situation came up, maybe I would look into getting a housemate.   
  
In October, a close friend of mine broke up with her partner, so she moved back in with her mum temporarily. I'd thought at the time that maybe I would ask her to move in… I thought over it for a few weeks - part of me was hesitant, but I just shrugged that off as me being stubborn in having to adapt to living with someone else again. So I ended up asking her and she was really excited. I told her that it wouldn't be for a couple of months though, because I had to organise a few things with the house so that there was room for her and such. Well, I've been putting it off, but decided to give her a date so that I had something to work towards, so I said she could move in mid-March.   
  
The past few weeks her behaviour has been changing. Like me, she has a history of mental illness stuff… We've always had very different ways of dealing with it though. I tend to keep things in and try to deal with them on my own - if they get really, really bad I might talk to someone about it, but for the most part I keep it in. In saying that, I'm mostly doing well all the time these days, but it's taken a lot of work to get where I am… On my bad days, I still have to make myself put things aside to think about when I'm feeling more positive, or just force myself to think rationally when it isn't coming naturally to me at all. My friend, on the other hand, has always put her stuff onto other people and expected them to solve her problems and tell her how to handle things. So, if that's how she is, why the f*** would I ask her to move in you might wonder? Well, for the past 18 months or so, she's been mostly good. She hasn't depended on me for stuff at all - we've had a very normal and good friendship… it's only now that I'm realising it was because she was putting all her emotional stuff onto her partner, and now that they're no longer together, it's being redirected onto me.   
  
On Friday she texted me very late at night saying sorry but she was having a bad time and obsessing and I don't know what I want you to do about it but please can we meet on Saturday, etc. Well, I was working and didn't finish til late, so I waited til the next day to respond. I actually couldn't meet up with her because I had a super busy weekend - friends visiting from out of town, work, and general house things to do. Normally I would drop everything for a friend… but lately she's been like this and I felt it was important to maintain some boundaries… I don't know if that was the right thing to do :/ In my response I made some suggestions - basically encouraged her to be self-compassionate and try to put aside what she was thinking about to give herself a break… Try to look at small things instead of the big picture so it wouldn't be so overwhelming… And suggested a couple of other people she might be able to talk to. I didn't hear back from her, so I just went on with my day.   
  
So last night (Saturday) I'm in bed, you know, sleeping… and at 12:30am my phone starts ringing… I look over and it's her… I was just like no, I'm not doing this now … so I roll over and wait for it to stop. Then immediately it starts ringing again… my reaction is pretty much full of expletives and general half asleep yelling… so I won't go into it. I was so mad… It just seems to me to be completely inappropriate… I would never call someone at that hour unless something really major had happened. This morning I wake to a really long message from her saying sorry for calling so late but I thought you might be awake (??? Why???) … and then all this stuff about how she's freaking out about stuff and obsessing over things and doesn't know what to do. The thing is, over the years, whenever anyone has told her something about her mental health she clings onto it and obsesses over it - it becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy almost… so her counsellor recently told her she has 'unrelenting standards' and she now won't let it go and is completely obsessing over the idea and it's just become a huge problem that she feels she has to solve but can't. She also has an 'all or nothing' thing… every guy that she feels something for its immediately I'm in love. He's the one… there's never an in between - its always extreme and intense. In the message she's saying that she messed everything up with her ex - she thought she was too good for him because of her 'unrelenting standards', but now she sees he's better than her… then things about a couple of guys that she's recently had her attentions on… The message ended with her saying she was going to send this to this guy, but thought it would be better to send to me because you're my best friend and I need you to help me, cause I sure as f*** can't help myself.   
  
What the hell does she want me to do??? The thing is, in the past I would've dropped everything and been there for her and let this play out… but over the past 12 months, I've really done some growing I guess and I know more of who I am and how I feel about things… and somewhere along there I must've come to a place where I think this behaviour is not okay anymore and I really think that I need to establish some boundaries with her.  
  
I think it's a terrible idea for her to move in… I feel like she's going to put all her stuff onto me, and my home is really my safe space - I don't want to feel like I'm trapped here or like its somewhere I don't want to be. If she can't respect my boundaries when she's not living here, what would it be like if she did move in?  
  
Am I being unfair? Do I sound cold? The thing is that there's a lot of history between us and a lot of behaviour like this… so if I do sound cold, I think maybe it's because of being frustrated that after all these years this is still going on, and I've had enough. Is it the right thing for me to tell her she can't move in? If so, how would I even do that? She's so unstable at the moment that I feel like that would send her over the edge… I just don't know what to do… I'm terrible at confrontation :s   
  
Please feel free to ask any questions if this all doesn't make sense. Any advice or insights that anyone can provide will be much appreciated…

18473,Non-Romantic,2gbjqe,"Hi r/relationships, 

Starting when my wife was 10 years old she was molested repeatedly by her uncle. She kept it bottled up inside for years until finally in her mid-twenties it all came out. She told her parents and a few close family members.

Her aunt (married to her abuser) is perhaps her favourite person in the world, and she kept it hidden from her out of fear of losing that relationship or the one with her young cousins. I can't understate how important her family is to her. 

 I think what prompted my wife's breakdown was that her young cousins were approaching the age at which she was molested and she felt serious guilt at not saying anything.

She made an anonymous call to Child Services told her story left it at that. Child Services investigated the family and was satisfied that the children were not being abused.

This was all about 6 years ago. Out of respect for my wife's wishes, I just accepted that her abuser was still a part of our life, but it still affects her in many ways.  Including so far as having to stop certain things because she would have flashbacks and see me as her abuser. When we visit her family (on the other side of the country), he is there. Soon, most of the family knew, except for the favourite aunt, and their children.

We have been to counselling to see how we can both deal with these issues. They came up most recently during the birth of our first child when my wife would have panic attacks thinking about the birth. I don't fully understand but between her counsellor and our midwife it was determined that only women (and myself) would be allowed in the delivery room. She was having flashbacks about the abuse when thinking about delivering our baby.

Overall, she handled this remarkably well though, she is not depressed, she is genuinely happy most of the time and very outgoing. We had kind of just managed to ignore the elephant in the room when we were visiting her family.

That's all changed now. Due to another issue in the family someone else dropped the bomb (we didn't even know he knew) to her aunt about the abuse. In an angry email sent out to the whole family. I've never heard my wife sob so loudly as when she read that email.

She was terrified of people blaming her for breaking up the family or of her aunt not believing her and not letting her see her cousins.

As fate would have it, 2 days later her grandpa (who she was incredibly close to) passed away, 4 weeks after the birth of our first child. The first great grandchild in the family. Edit: I should add that everyone seems remarkably okay with his passing. He was 86, and died peacefully in his sleep.

My wife had to fly out to be with her family, I joined her a couple days later. Of course there were so many mixed emotions, the death of the patriarch, the birth of our child, the angry email, and the new knowledge of the molestation.

To her credit, my wife's aunt kicked her husband out, but only temporarily it seems. He is starting to come around again. Apparently the previous night he came by her grandpa's place, and his partner welcomed him in for dinner and led them in prayer and everything. 

This very much upset my wife who called me in tears. But we're both so full of emotions we don't know what we want or what is fair to expect.

On the one hand, it happened more than 20 years ago, since then her uncle has stopped drinking and become a born again Christian. But here's the thing, he's still a total asshole. He's the kind of guy who loves to make others angry and push their buttons. His response to people feeling uncomfortable was I hope it's not always going to be like this. No sense of apology or contrition or anything. In other words, I don't really think he's a better person. I could very much see forgiving him if he had become a genuinely nice caring person. He is not.

So how much can we expect? How much *should* we expect? We don't want the family to break up, we don't want her aunt to leave her husband, but at the same time, how should we feel about a family that is okay with a guy who molested a 10 year old girl?

It really feels like they just all want to ignore it, and maybe that's what we should do? I just don't know. I don't know how to support my wife through this. I've told her I'll follow her lead and support whatever decision she wants to make, but at the same time I'm raging inside at her family (who I love very much, I should say). He's a fucking child molestor.

I need some perspective and advice. Please

1) My mum has a background which does indicate she would have mental issues. Pretty serious ones. Therefore I cannot blame her for her abuse as she is a product of abuse herself.

2) My father made some selfish choices which brought her to a situation where she began to feel worthless and, as a result, blamed us. This is why I believe she abuses us

3) After 10 years and everyone in the family trying to do what she has asked us to do, I have realised that this is not an problem with a solution. There is no point where she will no longer feel the need to abuse us, nothing has ever worked and it is exhausting and depressing to think of the four wasted childhoods that have resulted. 

4) I can no longer allow this problem to continue. My youngest sister is depressed, moody and has seen things no child should have to see. I need to protect her. My second youngest is incredibly depressed judging from the scars she inflicted on herself but cannot be sent to a therapist without parental consent, as she is a minor. My mother will not give consent because if abuse is mentioned to a therapist they must tell the police. We all lied about the abuse prior to this so we would all be fucked. My oldest sister is emotionally repressed, with seriously critical views of herself and very much like my mother sometimes. Not in an abusive way, but in the way her emotions switch and her temper.

5) My mother is getting worse. She is sucking the happiness out of our home and I am terrified of my father snapping from her constant inhumane abuse and doing something that can't be fixed.

6) They will not divorce, my mum will not move out or allow my dads business to move out. She retains small, critical areas of daily household running that she will not share so she remains indispensable. We are not in a financial state to have any major changes happening

7) If my mum is found to have lied to the courts about potential illegal activity she will be stripped of her ability to be a lawyer. If my dad is found to have endangered us he may loose his practice. 

BACKSTORY: LONG BUT A SKIM READ WILL PROBABLY DO. I WILL MARK VERT RELAVENT SECTIONS


This prestory is important! My mum was always the smartest cookie in school, she taught herself to read when she was 4, graduated when she was 15 and was one of the first women to graduate from the engineering program at her university (she had a full scholarship and was employed by one of the largest engineering companies.) She met my dad when she was around 20, they got married at 24/5. They moved from South Africa to a better country because of my mums engineering, where my dad was able to get employment as an intern. My mums dad (my grandfather) killed himself when she was very young. He was basically a war criminal from what I've been told. He had serious depression, and would beat and, according to my older sister, there was an accusation of sexual abuse thrown around. My mum is the one who found his body (she was around 11.) She was sent to boarding school shortly after and my grandmother moved to Greece.  My half uncle overdosed when he was 20, from my understanding he was close to my mother. My great aunt killed herself as well. In my family they call it a curse, but I don't know if that's true. None of them speak to each other because of all the horrible past, and they all blame and detest each other. 

---Not as important---

They had my older sister, Jane, when they they were around 30 and my mum took time off work to raise her. Dad was still doing intern stuff, making a name for himself as a doctor. She went back to work after a time and with her career, and my dads slightly lesser career, we were fine financially. I was born two years later, she took time off work then returned. This is where stuff starts to get complicated. My dad accepted a job in a better city without telling my mum. He moved there, and said she should come to. He did this because it was a really good opportunity for him and I think he was tired of being the lesser earner, the less brilliant one. My dad is like that. He was also a really smart guy, but more of a rebel. He smoked, partied and was a bad boy. He got his act together to become a doctor and he is one of the smartest, most ethical guys I've ever met.

In order to follow my dad she had to quit her job. She did it, grudgingly, but the new city was better than the old so in some ways it was better. Once she was there she had my younger sister Amanda, and because of my dad wanted to start his own practice, and because having three daughters under the age of 10 is incredibly hard work, my mum quit her job and worked in my dad's practice while raising us. He started earning huge amounts of money and they had another girl, my baby sister Mandy. I think they really wanted to have a son, which is why they kept trying, but the luck wasn't in the cards and they just had us. I know I was meant to be the son, but we were all huge tomboys so hopefully that filled the gaping hole in their hearts ;)

At first, my mum excelled at the business and she really set up an efficient system. She really helped him. But as time went on, they got a big house and sent us all to private school so what my mum thought was a gig that would last us until we all hit school became much longer. She blamed my dad for being unable to get a job, and started drinking really heavily. Since this time she has not been sober for longer than three days. She was also a mother returning to the workforce, and re-entry is even harder when the field is male dominated and you NEED to have the most up to date information. The leaps and bounds in technology in the early 2000's maybe didn't help my family in that respect.

Important

Anyway, sorry for rambling. This is when my mum started her abuse. She would get roaring drunk, like so drunk she would piss herself, walk around naked and throw her tampons at us. She would chase me around the house.  It was primarily focused towards me initially, as my older sister was literally golden (smart, athletic, into musical instruments) whereas I was more of a grey (think runescape, socially awkward and only interested in English/Lit, with bad grades in everything else.) I was, however, considered very pretty as a child so I wasn't totally irredeemable. My mum started bringing me upstairs from the age of 10 and emotionally abusing me every night. I wont go into the abuse but it was incredibly cruel to do that to a child and, looking back, I was simultaneously her emotional crutch (thats why I know so much about her life) and her punching bag. I thought by listening to her and being there she might hate me less. Long story short, it didn't work, and by the time I hit 13/14 I wasn't so cute and it became even worse. I can't really talk about it without crying.

Jane's friends told the school we attended about what was happening when she was 17 and I was 15. I remember thinking thank god, its finally over, they know and they will help us. It didn't help. My mum became so enraged about us 'betraying' her, she said and did awful things. She threatened to do awful things. Dad asked us to lie to them, to make the government go away as mum had promised to go to a therapist and work on her issues but the practice could not survive whatever my mum was planning. My mum also denied she had ever hit us, or abused us. She claimed she had no memory of her doing anything wrong. This sort of fits, because every morning after she would be fine, unless something really bad happened. We would separate her into day mum, and night mum. Day mum loved us, night mum hated us. 

This memory loss is why I think she may have some sort of mental disorder. She genuinely had two different states of being, day mum and night mum. Sometimes day mum would be night mum, but night mum was always around. It didn't matter where we were, she would be this person. She has no shame or embarrassment in this regard. She has tried to kill herself in front of me and my baby sister Mandy by slicing open her own throat. It didn't work, but she is a danger to herself as well as others. 

My mum went to the therapist once and then everything started right back up, no difference, except Jane was her primary target and we were the horrible people who had ratted in their own mum. She managed to get into a law course, finish the degree and the entire time she was abusive, manipulative. I cannot stress enough that it was every night, without fail. My family would not go out, because she would make a scene, and she isolated every family friend through her drunken tirades. This entire time my dad was working full time supporting a family. My mum liked to buy expensive things and travel, so thats what they did. 

My father, however, is no saint. Around four years ago he started goading her into a fight. Whenever I thought she might be getting better, he would drag her back with all his anger about what she had done to him, to our family. He would say despicable things to her. 


My mum and dad are the main focus in this paragraph. My dad, at the same time as my abuse, would get abused when he stopped her from hurting me. In the 10 years together they have broken each others bones, my dad's eyes are permanently fucked from her gouging, he has broken ribs from being pushed down the stairs, black eyes, torn clothes, bruises and more. My mum has permanent scars, and other injuries but these are not my dad's fault.They are in that he was the one who hurt her, but I do not blame my father. She literally will goad you until you strike back. The first time I hit her I felt atrocious, even though she hit me first, but that's what she wanted. For me to be at her level. She will say anything to get a reaction out of him. An example is her telling him he will go the same way as his dad the day after his funeral. She will hit, kick, taunt and degrade him until he snaps. I have watched her hit him in the face repeatedly until he pushed her away, she is so drunk she falls over and then she starts SCREAMING at the top of her voice. It hurts my brain and my heart. If he so much as touches her, that is what she does. The nights spent just listening to her scream when he snapped, not knowing to run upstairs and see if this is the time he goes to far. Not wanting to go up because I don't want to be involved. Listening to your mother screaming for help and not wanting to help her. Its horrible. My baby sisters have been hearing it since before they could understand why. There is no way they have come out of this unscathed. 


THIS IS THE PART YOU CAN READ IF THE OTHER STUFF WAS TOO LONG
I can't go on much longer knowing this abuse happening. I don't know what to do or who to go to. I understand why she is the way she is - once she was at the peak of her game, and because of my dad and my siblings and I she became a mother instead of an engineer. She had a terrible time growing up. But this is no longer something we can just live with. My mum was okay to be around when she first got her job but now shes worse then before, she is biting my dad when she tries to fight him and she is ripping out flesh. I don't know what I can do. Please, if you have any suggestions, post them. Thank you for reading this, it was very therapeutic to write.

TL;DR I think my mum has some sort of mental disorder and she is only getting worse, I don't know how much longer my family can survive this. ","My [20F] mum [54F] has been abusive since I was around 10, my younger siblings are becoming seriously disturbed and nothing I have tried has worked. Please help.",0.0,False,2.0,5.0,1410348775.0,/r/relationships/comments/2fzwcr/my_20f_mum_54f_has_been_abusive_since_i_was/,NonRomantic
18494,Non-Romantic,2c560f,"Hey all. So. I'm 24, I still live with my parents. Yeah, I know, but I am American, bit from really strict immigrant stock, so this is considered normal. My folks are fairly liberal now, but at times not. They are Catholic. I converted to Judaism two years ago with their support. I have a boyfriend who I stay with a few nights a week, and while I can sleep there, he may not share a bed at our place. It's kind of like that. 

My great uncle passed over a month ago, and the memorial service is on Saturday. My parents are going and invited me to come along. I am not sure if I should. For one, I haven't spoken to my family in any capacity since we went to a family event eight years ago. We moved from the city twelve years ago, around the time a family feud erupted over my great grandmother's will, and most of them stopped talking to my mother. I have literally no relationship or connection to these people save blood. They don't know I'm Jewish either. I don't know how to go along with the mass in a way that doesn't show that I'm out of the church. We've had a few converts out, but they were all at least Christian and no atheists or anything else. They're anti Semitic people. I remember a few uncles making comments when I was younger. With the Gaza thing going on, I imagine it'll be bad. Plus, it's a ten hour drive from Virginia to Brooklyn. None of this would be an issue if we were at least in the same state. We'd be staying with my uncle, whom Lets just say is his own can of worms. I just don't see this ending well, with my massive (diagnosed) anxiety issues. I feel like a lot of eyes will be on me, and I won't be able to act in a manner that won't start something, either my non-Catholic status, or something. They're all nitpicky, strict, traditional people. They gossip, and they start trouble at the drop of a hat. 

Okay, so what's the problem? I feel like I should consider it. My great aunt's husband died, plus her son a few moths ago. She was the only family member to somewhat keep in touch with us after the feud/move. I honestly feel horrible for her. I also feel like it would be immensely disrespectful if I don't go. My brother is not, he had already purchased tickets to see his long distance boyfriend with my parents' blessing. But as the oldest and now only eligible child to go, I feel like I should. I know my mother misses her family and feels like this might be the wake up call for them to get over a twelve year old fight and reconnect. I feel like it would look bad if I'm not there along with my brother. 

It's just tricky. I have major social anxiety issues that I can manage 95% of the time and I just see so much that could potentially happen. And this is not the time. I spent twelve years out of that and became a very liberal girl. I'm proud of who I am, but I don't want to get sucked back into the backstabbing, politics, drama that is my maternal family. They are people I share genetics with. I've made my own family out of my hobbies and from college. I don't intend on having kids, but if that changes, I still don't want them to have anything to do with these people, not after watching how they treated my parents. But while my father said he and mom support whatever decision I make, I don't think my mother would. Guilt runs deep in my non Jewish family.

18498,Non-Romantic,2sie39,"Typically when I tell this story I crack my knuckles and tell the audience to settle in. So here we go, I am going to try and abbreviate this as much as possible because, I don't know you- but I respect your time is precious.
One day my Russian co-worker comes into my office and drops a CV off on my desk and explains he is a friend of her husband's friend and to hire him as an intern. So I do, I sit through a Skype interview and do my nails as this kid babbles on about his interest in international development. Half an hour after he was done I put the request for his hire through. It completely slipped my mind and then three weeks later this tall, beautiful boy in pressed suit comes into my office and is introduced to me as Jim, my new intern.
Yeah, of course I blanked on this, and then it all made sense. I explained to HR in front of the new kid that this was someone else's intern and I had just interviewed him. HR insisted that they were correct. I was expecting another intern in a week so I thought I would keep him busy and far away and then when my intern came- I would hope someone else would snatch him up.
Jim was beautiful, he was Italian and Swedish, tall and had the very slightest Nordic accent. All the other Associates chided me saying that they knew exactly why I hired him. I did know however that the largely female population of interns were going to eat him alive. This kid, who was stereotypically hot- which was more than enough reason for me to despises him seemed very sweet and genuine- and somewhere in my cold back speck of a heart I felt bad for all the busy work I was giving him.
As time wore on it became clear he and I would be working together. I was mostly okay with that. I did resent the multiple times an hour he would come into my office to ask seemingly pointless questions. We had a slow and easy friendship. He learned my quirks (I have a shit ton), and he seemed to account for them in work and public events. I liked the kid.
The office where we worked was something like a battleground- co-workers were friends in arms and happy hours were insanely necessary. Interns and Associates alike mingled and drank- eventually I was outside with him smoking a cigarette. Outside he told me that he used to be a drug dealer before he came here and recounted the violent things he did. His face seemed genuinely upset. I started to see my mild mannered intern in a different light.
Another company tradition was the sangria night where we said goodbye to co-workers with endless sangria and guacamole. Needless to say this particular night everyone got hammered. He and I went outside for a much needed smoke and as we sat there he told me that he had been having an ongoing affair with a member of the table who had a boyfriend. I just shook my head and agreed that he had quite a problem on his hands. Then he turned the conversation and told me that we would sleep together as often as I wanted and there would be no strings attached. He talked about it like it was a done deal. I doubled over laughing and declined- he followed me back into the restaurant insisting I change my mind. Spoiler- I didn't sleep with my intern.
The next day it was revealed to me that while I had turned down his advances he had found a home for his lust with another co-worker. I then understood who my intern really was and I found it super amusing. He led a life I could never ever imagine but I thought it was cool in theory. So I listened to his adventures in lust. One day he came into my office and insisted that tonight the coworker who had a boyfriend, Kim was coming over to get her things and then he was done sleeping with her. I retorted that there was no reason at all for her to come over as they would most likely sleep together- he fervently denied and promised to call when she left to prove it.
At 3 AM I woke up and saw that I had 14 missed calls and two progressively louder sobbing messages on my machine. Jim insisted that I call immediately. So I called right away. He apologized right off the bat and insisted that I check my company e-mail. I did and saw that Kim's boyfriend had found out and had chosen to e-mail the whole entire home office all the details of the affair. Needless to say that the mood in the office was incredibly tense and Jim knew he could no longer be visibly friends with any women in the office.
Our friendship grew in secret though- and I also did not want people to know how close we had gotten. We quickly did Little Saturdays (drinking like it was Saturday on Wednesday), laid in the pool area of the near by hotel, once we fell asleep in front of the Washington Monument- we shared an incredibly large amount of fun together and quickly were together every weekend.
WE-were-just-friends
Of course, he was BEAUTIFUL I thought so too- but I knew that Jim was troubled-he was a sex addict- sleeping with anyone he possibly could; not even because he wanted to because he felt he had to. This included some of my friends which caused bitter fights between us. Refer above- I knew that I didn't love him but there was just something weird about my friends being on a level of intimacy with Jim that I was not. I don't know it- was weird.
Around this time though I received news I had been waiting for, for a while. I had been accepted into a graduate program in London and I was going to leave in a few months. I'll be completely honest one of the hardest things to leave was Jim. He was the relationship I loved- I had all the emotional intimacy that I could ever want and I did not need to worry about monogamy- I would never have it. I felt this weird superiority to the women he slept with. They were things he could throw away, but he told me that he couldn't sleep with me out of fear that it would ruin our friendship.
I left the morning after our last hurrah- we went out in true fashion and drank till we couldn't anymore. Grabbed champagne and passed out in a hotel together. We woke up very late- both of us missing important events in favor of not getting out of bed. Until the time came and we had to face the fact that we had to leave each other. I hugged him tearfully and watched him leave.
The next day I flew out. He had given me a journal so I could write the script of our friendship movie and I had given him a lighter with a favorite quote of ours on it. I wrote in that journal obsessively as I arrived, everything I was afraid of i told the journal- every first day- every class. Until I realized I should send it to him to write back.
December hit and Jim was coming to visit for a week and I could not be more excited. We had kept in touch via Skype. I skipped to the airport to pick him up and brought him home with me for hangovers, boozing and revelry. It was like old times. Jim briefly left to visit Sweden and came back for a day. I planned the whole day out to the T. We ended the night in a panoramic sky bar above London, where we kept throwing back absinthe martins. I started to realized that he was trying to get me drunk. I paused and asked him what was going on. He put down his glass and looked me in the eye and told me he was sleeping with Kim again.
A this point I lowered my head and I started to laugh- I turned to him my dear sweet Jim, who we had both mutually swore off relationships ever in our lives, I said you must love her. He immediately jumped back and said absolutely not. He confessed she had feelings for him and he had told her it was not mutual. But she was still running when he called and he was in the process of convincing her to engage in a threesome.
I was drunk sure, but hot tears came to my eyes and I told him he was being so cruel. No girl deserves to be treated like this. I know she knew what was happening to her and still accepted it, but it simply wasn't fair. We were BEST FRIENDS- I was not going to let my BEST FRIEND treat someone (who I did not even like), the way he was. I railed into him telling him I knew he was better than that and I was going to hold him to a higher standard, sorry.
The conversation petered out as we realized there was nothing more to say. I had shocked him into silence and we rode home on the bus with promise to talk further. Once back at my place I told him I thought we were both tired and suggested we go to bed.
The next day we flew back home and went our separate ways for Christmas to be reunited at New Years. I of course missed him- he was my bud and he had been my constant for the past week. So I looked forward to NYE where we were going to meet mutual friends for dinner. I drove down at top speeds looking forward to everything.
Once in the restaurant I saw Jim and immediately realized he was drunk. At the table he was feeling his nipples and talking about how sexy he was and how he wished he could have sex with himself.
Pause- the Jim I knew in London was raw and emotional. I know I couldn't expect that again- but not this. I constantly asked him to please stop and that's really the only way I have to do that. Like a dog growling. He wouldn't stop so I went to the bathroom to cool down. I came back and tried to regear the conversation. Instead he brought it right back around to Kim showing naked pictures of her. I became incensed and asked him to please stop right now. He refused and brought up out conversation in London as if it was a joke and made fun of me for crying.
I snapped.
Being nice was far from over. I snapped and lashed out using words that I knew would sting his fragile ego. I left that night and sent him a variety of messages saying we owed our friends an apology for our fight in the middle of their dinner.
I heard nothing and the following days I was in town he cancelled every day. The final straw was when he cancelled on me for a party being held in my honor. I broke down sobbing- I was so hurt- I had done so much for him in London- this was it? My friend called him and he was guilted and he finally he came to the party. He came in went down stairs and didn't even say goodbye.
He finally decided to come to dinner one last time- he was mad at me for being mad at him and insisted that I was the one who ruined the dinner, not he. It was civil peace until he decided after a bottle of wine to bring up our problem within a group of people. I asked him to stop several times and lashed back, I wasn't ready to discuss it and didn't want to share it with the whole group. He insisted and it spiraled out of control. We let all of our problems with each other out and in half an hour time we both stormed out in tears.
The next day I felt like I had broken up with him. I thought back on what he said- I clearly care about you, I have never left you to go sleep with someone else. That was kind of it. Did I want a best friend where that was how his love was?
There was a time in my life where i needed Jim and I needed to party till 6 AM and try new things. But I wasn't sure if I needed someone in my life who I gave so much to and never got a whole lot back. Sure, Jim cared for me in his own way. I don't doubt it- but I faced the fact that I may have outgrown him.
Jim has a deep plethora of problems he refuses to deal with and hides them with sex and alcohol. He would call to vent about his family and friend issues and I always listened. I was where he was and I needed that friend. Now I think I may not need that kind of relationship.
We talked for a second agreeing we needed to talk again and alcohol fueled everything. Now I am back in London and we haven't talked for over a week.

18530,Non-Romantic,224w6e,"I'm currently living in a house with three roommates. Up until a month ago, it was just me and two other guys. I've been living here for three years, as has one of the other guys, Jay. The third roommate, Hector, has lived here for over ten. We all get along great. Everyone has adult jobs and responsibilities. We had an extra room in the house so we decided to look for a fourth roommate in order to cut down on rent and utilities. 

Enter Bill. Bill had recently moved in from out of state and his uncle got him a job at the place we both work at. I've worked with his uncle for three years. Bill and I got to talking and he said he was looking for a place to live. We both wanted to get to know each other first so I tentatively offered him a room in our house. We set a move in date for three months away. We both had plenty of time to size each other up and hang out before Bill moved in. This was to be sure that Bill was a stand up guy; we've all had roommate trouble in the past and didn't want some weirdo living with us.

So after a three month get-to-know-you period, Bill ended up moving in. There were three rules everyone agreed on: be clean, no pets, and *absolutely* no drugs. I really pushed the no drugs because myself, Hector, and Jay are all completely clean and the industry I work in is notorious for drug use. None of us want to be associated with drugs or the kind of people who do them.

Everyone here subleases from Hector, who rents from a company in town, but there isn't a lease for the subletters. It's all based on verbal agreements and the honor system. This is important for later.

Bill lives here a month and I start to get a little worried about him. He talks about his checkered past and he doesn't seem to be quite the stand-up guy that he was before he moved in. I'll spare you the details and cut to the chase: less than a week ago, he was arrested for felony cocaine possession. He told me about it because he missed work due to being in jail and it was going to get around to me. I'm certain that he wouldn't have mentioned it to me otherwise, as we don't share social circles. He begged me not to tell Hector or Jay. I told them(duh) but he doesn't know that yet.

He swears up and down that it was a misunderstanding, that he wasn't buying, that he was just with some guy in the guy's car and the guy whipped out some coke. I don't believe him. I was there for one of my (ex) best friends' downward spiral with opiates so I understand how someone addicted to a hard drug can be. I'm not here to debate whether or not he was actually buying cocaine(or god forbid, selling it); that itself is basically irrelevant to me. Even if it was a serious misunderstanding--which I don't believe in the slightest--I still don't want to be associated with, much less living with, a felon OR somebody who even potentially does drugs. I don't care if he gets it knocked down to a misdemeanor, thrown out, whatever, I do NOT want to live with this guy any more. Hector and Jay both feel the same way. We want him gone.

Herein lies the problem. This is a tough situation because we don't know the best way to get him or his stuff out. I convinced him to tell Hector about this but he hasn't yet. So he's going to be confronted with the knowledge that I broke his trust, he'll have to move out immediately with nowhere to go, and so on. He has family in town but he's told me that they won't take him in. I'm not sure if this is a lie or not. To make matters worse, he can have a temper. I want to piss him off as little as possible, especially if he's a closet cokehead. The last thing we want is for him to get violent or fuck with our stuff. We just want him to leave. 

I was thinking that I could rent a storage unit for a month so he'll have a place for his things in the interim. I've looked into it already and this is feasible.  Despite what happened, we don't want to throw the guy into the street. We just want him gone. We were also thinking about calling the police and having an officer around during the moveout. We don't want to just drop all this on him-- and right now, as far as I know he thinks everything is ok--but if he really is a cokehead(likely) then there's no telling what he might do if we let him stay after telling him to get out. Reddit, what is the best way to go about this?

Then a few months later, my sister texts me that my mom had been diagnosed with lung cancer. My sister only found out, because she happened to go see her that day. 

Even for weeks later my mom insisted that it was just broken ribs that they were seeing in the scan, not tumors. She has always been a heavy smoker, and I could tell that she was smoking while talking with me on the phone too. Her excuses have ranged from I could quit any time I want to I've cut down to the doctor told me to just live my life normally, so I am.

So her first round of chemo starts tomorrow. My sister offered to take her there and be with her, but she refused.

She has never been a strong willed woman, so this behavior is very confusing to me. It certainly doesn't seem like she's doing it to show strength, or even because she doesn't want us to worry. It just seems like she just does not care.

I had sent her a webcam a few weeks ago. I told her before hand to expect it. She never picked it up from the post office, and it got returned. When I asked why, she said that she had been busy with doctors appointments. I asked her how many, and she said one. 

Most of the days she just sits at her apartment, smoking, and goes out to walk the dogs twice a day. And that's it.

So I'm not sure what can I do from this distance. And I hate to say it, but I don't feel like investing that much effort since there's no echo on it.

She's probably depressed. And she is on antidepressants, but she doesn't see a therapist or psychiatrist regularly. I told her that I've received great help from seeing a therapist, but she said that she saw one for one or two times but it didn't help.

Several years ago, my sister cornered me and said You're either a lesbian or asexual, which is it? and wouldn't let me leave without an answer.  I told her I was asexual, which is true, and she left me alone.

I decided to let her know when I got a partner last winter, shortly after which she began to rub it in my face that she knew I was a lesbian, and continuously ask how lesbian sex worked/what I considered sex.  I've told her each time that it's an inappropriate question to ask, reminded her that being asexual generally indicates that I'm not planning on having any sex, and explained that I am pan/biromantic, not a lesbian. This has not stopped her from asking.

Recently she revealed that she'd found an account on a job networking site with my preferred name (which is gender neutral and based off a childhood nickname so she did not suspect anything.)
 
Today she sent an email I requested from her to my private email account.  I use this email to prevent cross contamination with accounts in my legal vs my preferred name, and there is zero reason she should have been able to find it. This indicates to me that she has been snooping, and that it's not going to be long before she finds out I identify as male.


Each time I do visit, she takes me aside and tells me over and over that I am hurting our parents by not trusting them enough to come out. When I remind her that I was mocked and harassed by them when I opposed local anti-gay laws several years back, she begins to cry and accuses me of not giving them a chance to accept me. 

It is true that they've made progress since then, but by no means would I be able to come out as pan/bi, and transgender. In addition, our extended family is violently homophobic. Even if coming out to mom and dad goes well, once news gets around to my sixty something aunts, uncles, and cousins I'm pretty much screwed. 

I am concerned that when I go home for Thanksgiving that she is going to try to force me to come out or out me without my permission. I'm absolutely done with her behavior, and I really don't want to keep interacting with her regardless.

My friend's husband has repeatedly cheated on her. I and she know of at least 4 or 5 instances over the years, but it has probably been more than that. He is also a complete tool. I am hate him for how he treats her and for good reasons. 

She has provided for him their entire relationship. She works 2 jobs, cooks, cleans, and watches their  child. Even though they are strapped for cash she has to hire a babysitter when she works because he rarely watches their child. He does the odd job every once in a while but instead of using the money for their debts, mostly due to his DUI and his unfinished degree, he spends it on drinks for himself and his friends. 

While he goes out regularly to bars with his friends, she goes out like once every 4 months. When she does go out, he tells her where to go and not to go. We think it's because he wants her to go to places he knows his friends will be to watch her and he doesn't want her to show up at a place where people think he is single. Yeah, he tells people he is a single father. Found that out through a mutual friend. 

He is very strict on his privacy. He has a prepaid cellphone which she pays for but he refuses to let her see it. He sleeps with it and has it locked. She managed to read it a couple of times and found explicit pictures and conversations with women that he promised to end. Some did but others haven't. 

He uses her car to go out and sometimes has not brought the car back in time for her to go to work. Once she was 6 hours late because of this. While he either ignored her calls or sent text that she needed an attitude adjustment. All she was trying to do was figure out if he was okay at first then yelled at him her car home so she could work. This whole ordeal cost her money they desperately needed and put her job in jeopardy. 

During fights he has told her more than once he is only with her because she is his meal ticket and if they were to divorce he would take their child and she would never see her. Which I highly doubt he would get custody because he would have no where to live, no income, and was arrested for a felony which was sealed but still. 

They separated once but got back together. He promised no more infidelity but has not kept that promise. He constantly lies to her and belittles her in front of his friends. I am worried she doesn't think she could find someone else.

We had been very close friends for about 2 years and acquaintances for about 2 years before that.

We have plenty of mutual friends - some who are closer with her, and some who are closer with me. Because of this, I am in no way expecting her to be out of my life, and that's fine. At this point, I don't plan to speak to her unless I need to for some reason, or if she speaks to me first I would respond. I have every intention of being polite in that event.

But going forward I feel that people are going to ask me where's Jane? or something along those lines - as we have been known in the past to spend a lot of time together. Sure I can just say haven't heard from her or I don't know and leave it at that but if I am pressed I may have to say in some way that we aren't friends anymore/aren't speaking. And that will almost certainly result in a why?

How do I answer that? I don't want to talk behind her back or say anything rude. But these people are also my friends so I don't want to say it's none of your buisness or anything.

The details of the falling out aren't that important it's just that she hurt me and I realized that she's not the kind of person I want to be close with.

When my mom and dad would work, they would drop me and my sister off at their place to be babysat. Though my aunt was busy with this and that, John would always have fun with us. He'd do art projects with us, help my sister with summer assignments, and play N64 with me. He never raised his voice, never tried to discipline us, and was never anything short of awesome. On top of this, whenever my dad needed help with something, he'd be there in a flash. Because of this, it always bothered me how my dad and other uncle-in-law treated him.

Both of the latter have masters degrees, work in high paying positions and are pretty elitist. John on the other hand was a manager at a grocery store. My dad and other uncle would keep bringing him down at family gatherings and John was pretty prone to lying about petty things for status. 

About 7 years ago my aunt and uncle started arguing a lot. I didn't realize it back then but my parents would go to there house more often than usual to set some things straight.

John wanted to figure things out for his daughter but my aunt was stubborn and refused to even apologize.

Idiot, loser, dumbass, etc. I'm entirely sure her daughter doesn't know what went down but it's hard sitting there and watching her badmouth her father who, in my opinion, was the good guy in the scenario.

He lost his job a few months ago when the company he worked for ultimately decided they only wanted part-time employees for their sales locations. He never married or had children, and although he was once a pastor at a local church, we recently found out he stepped down from the church entirely about the time he lost his job.

It came as a huge shock to myself and my dad. We knew my aunt had been taking him to doctors to treat depression, but from what we all understood, he was doing well. However, it's now obvious he'd been planning this for a few months. D had purchased his burial plot, gravestone, and even a casket. When he was found, he'd very neatly laid out all of his bank statements, 401K, and CD information.

In total, this man had over $90K in his 401K, $36K in one CD and $20K in another, plus roughly $12K in his checking account. His car and trailer have all been paid off LONG ago and he's sitting on about two acres of land. He was the definition of frugal and had accrued all of this living on a barely-above-minimum wage salary for over 40 years.

My uncle did not have a notarized will. He did, however, leave a note behind that said he wanted *everything* to be left to my dad.

Now, my aunt and my other uncle are pissed off because they feel like they should get a share. My dad is actually prepared to split everything up evenly, but I told him he's absolutely crazy if he does.

Here's the thing. My dad is the sole caregiver for his elderly mother and stepfather. He's lived with them for over a year now and his stepfather is rapidly deteriorating in health with his mother right behind him. My dad works for a windshield company and doesn't make a whole lot of money; he's got about $4K in the bank and that's it. No CDs, no other kind of money honeypot with the exception of his 401K. 

My grandparents *maybe* have a couple thousand dollars to their name. While they get excellent healthcare coverage through my grandfather (who is a Vietnam veteran), that's about it. Morbid as it is, they might have a couple more years and then my dad could be looking at exorbitant hospital bills and funeral costs when they do pass.

I think this what my uncle D saw. He left everything to dad purposely not necessarily because he was his favorite, but because he knew my dad had a lot of responsibility coming his way in the next couple of years.

Not only that, but both my aunt and other uncle received their owed inheritance when my uncle D was alive. D supported my aunt and her two children when her husband was in and out of jail and always made sure they had Christmas and clothing. Even now that he's grown, my aunt's son has repeatedly had to borrow (re: take) money from my dad, my grandmother, my aunt, and uncle D while he was alive. My aunt isn't much better... she drained my grandparents dry before my dad put a stop to it when he moved in.

And my other uncle isn't much better. He was never able to have children, so he didn't even have that for an excuse. Instead, he committed tax fraud and racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in credit card bills. My uncle D gave him some money up until he found out that it was being used to buy booze and Xanax.

My dad, however, is the only one who never needed or asked for anything from Uncle D. I think this was my uncle's way to make it fair and to also provide a future for my dad. Dad doesn't have much time left before he won't be able to do such a labor intensive job. This money will take care of my grandparents and also pad my dad's atrocious savings account.

The funeral is tomorrow, so I haven't said much to him yet other than Are you sure you want to do that? There's something that feels skeezy about trying to divide up a person's assets before they're buried. But this *IS* a conversation that has to be had soon before dad throws away his chance to be comfortable in his golden years.

We all live together in a dorm hall and we spend almost all our free time together. I will call the guy in the relationship K and the girl H. The other main person involved is H’s roommate and best friend, who I will call M.

They hit it off right away and decided to ignore the “don’t date your hall mates” advice. From the moment they got together, it was extreme PDA whenever they were together. At first, this was manageable for the 3 of us.  I still got time with my “bros” and M still got her girl time with H. Things changed when we came back from winter break a few weeks ago. K and H have been attached at the hip. Whenever they’re not in class, they’re together. I get that they’re falling in love with each other, but living with this is unbearable at times. I could literally be having a conversation with H, only to have her turn away and ignore me mid-sentence because K has started kissing her.

We can’t drink together because every time we've tried, H and K have started grinding right in front of us and then eventually left to go have sex somewhere private. Every time we watch TV, they talk to each other so you can’t hear what’s going on and won’t stop no matter how many times you tell them; and if they get quiet, it’s because they’re making out. No, it doesn't matter how many people are around or who they are. I haven’t seen either of them alone for more than 10 minutes (excluding when they’re in class) in WEEKS. It’s embarrassing to go out in public with them because they’ll be kissing the whole time. Even if they’re not, they ignore the rest of us.

It has reached a boiling point recently, as we’re all getting increasingly annoyed. H and K get mad at the rest of us because they claim they “never do shit” around us. That is complete bullshit, so we’ll tell them and they get mad. It’s gotten to the point where we refuse to hang out with them if it's just one person with them. I hate this because they’re my friends and on the rare occasions when I get them alone, they’re awesome people. I just can’t stand being around them together.

She can be very negative about any suggestion to her out of the ordinary, I can't tell her much about my personal life because she's paranoid about absolutely everything, to some level. Does not respect any modicum of privacy and refuses to accept that it should be given because it's her house. Wants to look after everyone to the point that nobody is allowed to do anything for themselves - younger sisters not allowed to walk home from friends places if it's even slightly dark, in a completely safe neighbourhood, etc.


If she's having a serious episode she'll start ranting about how she hates everyone and everything, mostly her family and us, how she's going to kill everyone, etc. Never does anything physical (afaik, this may simply be because I've shown I won't take her shit in the past when I was younger) but WILL NOT stop talking at you. Makes me very unwilling to bring girls back as well, I feel understandably :P, which is awkward and possibly screwing up my chances at relationships, I'm not really sure.


Manages to enter a room almost exactly once per minute to rant about something that makes no sense, usually about how everything is someone elses fault, or how she knows things you dont, see's it all now, etc. Just generally becomes EXTREMELY hateful/spiteful. Classic paranoid schizophrenic stuff I suppose...


Thing is, when she's not like that, she's mooooostly fine, if a pain in the ass to deal with with the reasons outlined previously. Often times won't take medication though, drinks too much (which is usually what brings on the episodes, but refuses to acknowledge she has a problem, not alcoholism though), and refuses to go and see mental health workers if she's having/had a particularly bad episode, because they're all working against her, etc. Tends to hoard stuff, spends money which she probably shouldn't, any changes in life can upset her to the point it sets off another episode (for instance, throwing away old junk she has hoarded, clothes, etc).


Anyway, I've tried gently bringing this up with my father, who somehow has stayed with her all this time. He's quitting work soon, in order to try and look after her. I can't help but feel personally though that things would be better for everyone (but her, obviously..) if he divorced her, as the hatefulness that comes out is the most awful thing for everyone involved, though I don't really know if that'd even work logistically. I've mentioned this to him previously and he's just replied with who would that help?..


Basically I'm not sure how to bring that up and get him to listen, he seems pretty dedicated to her (which is fair enough, if that's what he really wants to do...), and I don't know what to do myself given the situation with renting a place of my own most likely being too expensive.


There's also a small part of me that feels I should stay around at the very least NEAR to home to be a bro for my youngest sis, who might need that.

I'm in the UK, going to be working in London, hence high rental prices etc... :/

When I first told my mom about him about a month ago, I mentioned that we are both the youngest children of a number of siblings (me of 4, he of 5). She said she read that relationships between youngest siblings don't work out, almost jokingly, so I brushed it off. 

It came up again today, so I tried to be sarcastic in saying that she was being silly. This time, my eldest sister who I very much look up to, said I need to stop being so sensitive.

Honestly, I'm kind of pissed. Whether or not this works out in the end, I am so happy and I REALLY want it to work. I am in such a good place.

She suggested to my SO that I was in love with his dad jokingly behind my back. Lately she's been acting worse, barely talking to me. My SO informed me it was because she didn't get a gift but to be fair, his sister got nothing too. I tend to just pick stuff up along the way. My SO only got practical things I found for cheap. I just didn't know what to get her and I didn't just leave her out either.

My SO's mom and I have nothing in common. She's not very respectful of my culture and asks awkward questions. I get it, she's an older white lady that was from a small town. I just feel awkward interacting with her all the time. She never gets when I'm kidding and her son is a perfect angel. If I make a sarcastic comment when my SO jokingly does his whole ego thing, she thinks I'm being a bitch.

She's constantly hinting how after a while you know the person well enough to get married and blah blah blah. Just constant aggressive hinting. She has different views on parenting and seemed really unhappy when I said I would want to go back to work when my 1 year maternity leave is up.

I think lately she's starting to express dissatisfaction in me because my spending habits vary from her. She thinks I'm wasteful just because I like to take care of my skin and also wear makeup. Get my hair done and occasionally get some nails done. It's all within my spending means. She's the type to just wash and go. She also blames me for being wasteful if my SO wants to take me out to dinner once in a while.

My SO and I want to move in together, I am comfortable with him paying for most living expenses because we discussed how we will switch off once I get a job because I am in my last year of schooling. He wants to move out to get away from her and also to be with me more to start our lives together. We can definitely afford it. She does not know this. I'm worried she will find out and create rumours in the family.

She's insistent my SO is super allergic to dogs and might become angry if we got a dog together. We feel like it's just a rumour she started when he was very young because he had zero reaction playing with my dog and my dog is not hypoallergenic..

18646,Non-Romantic,3f2bey,"I live with 4 people in a medium sized city this year. 2 people have their own rooms and 2 people share a room, and we have a kitchen, 1 bathroom, dining room and living room. I really like everyone I live with, but one girl has a boyfriend.

The boyfriend lives ~25 away with some roommates I think, but works at a company ~5 mins away from our apartment. At first, the girl roommate asked us if he could stay over one night and we all said yes. None of object to him staying over, but we thought it would be a 1-2 night a week thing. The boyfriend is nice and my friend too, but he has been staying over 5+ days straight. The roommate has her own room, but they/he will hangout in common rooms mostly, use our kitchen and bathroom, shower in the morning, and (rarely) eat our food but its still annoying. Its annoying to come home everyday and feel like we have a guest over, and it's a cramped apartment with 5 roommates. He doesn't pay for anything, but he doesn't use much of our utilites besides wifi and electric. 

Anyway, I get annoyed every morning when there is a line for the shower, or they are cooking using the entire kitchen, or when our garbage fills up way faster and he does 0 chores, or how they also use our couch to watch movies all the time...etc. Also it pisses me off that I pay rent for using the common rooms (my room too obviously but he stays in girlfriends room) and for the convenient location, but he abuses the fact that we have this nice apartment and close location by not paying anything and using communal stuff.

The other day a different roommate was acting pissy (about this, she feels the same) and the girlfriend and boyfriend asked me why when I was working in the living room and they were both there. I said I didn't know because I felt uncomfortable saying to the boyfriends face its because of him. They then said something like, BF doesn't say over too much right? I was like ehhhhh yeah kinda its a little much but it was super awkward because he was there. This also pissed me off because I feel like she said this in a way to trap me into saying its fine (i was alone, they were both there) so he could keep staying and she knew it was too much but felt like she could pressure me into saying it was fine.

So I know people are going to say, just talk to her BUT 1) he is over 90% of the time she is here 2) when he isn't here I'm just so happy I don't want to deal with getting in a fight and my other roommates are even more passive then me and avoid the convo even though they all hate it 3) I dont know what common rules are for the amount of nights guests should usually stay over for 4) if this goes badly we all share the same friend group and it could get really awkward.

18647,Non-Romantic,1ycggs,"TL;DR Got into a situation with a flatmate, I don't want a relationship but she can't let go.


About a month ago I got with one of my flatmates. We had sex a few times and she was getting more and more attached but eventually I told her that I had realised I didn't want to be in a relationship at this point in my life. She took it really badly, got blind drunk a few nights later and started flirting with another housemate and even chasing him into my room trying to demand we come out but he rejected her advances.


Three days ago she started messaging me on facebook asking what she had done wrong and telling me she wanted me et cetera. I told her she hadn't really but also that I found the other night embarrassing, and she didn't take it well. Last night she came up to my room drunk, forced the door open when I went to see who was knockin,g and wouldn't leave when I said I didn't want to talk about it at that time or place because I had to be up early the next day. She demanded that we talk about it then and refused to leave.


Eventually I got tired of fighting with her and let her stay because she'd started crying and I didn't want the rest of the flat to hear - they don't know about it at the moment. I told her I didn't want to be in a relationship and she said we could just have casual sex but I told her I didn't want that because I don't think she'll handle it well and she won't stop wanting it to be or seeing it as more.


When she was in my bed we ended up making out and she gave me head in the morning. I was caught up in the moment so went along with it but I regret it now. Like I said I don't want to be in a relationship and I don't think she can handle something casual. Today she texted me saying she could remember the morning but not last night and she asked what happened. I don't know what to tell her. She asked if I want to have sex this weekend, conveniently I'm away but I don't know what to do. I can't move out for a few months so that's not an option. I feel like she violated my trust and personal space by forcing herself into my room but I don't think she'll see it that way considering what happened this morning. Am I being unreasonable and what can I do?

So, I've been on vacation with my grandmother, aunt (a surgeon) and uncle for the last week or so, talking about things.

Apparently, my mom used to be fit, skinny, fashionable, and happy. My dad once told me When I met your mother, she used to wake up at 5am to do squats and run. My aunt told me that she quit smoking before I was born and replaced it with jogging 45 mins a day. She's a stock broker and apparently she made more money than my dad until I was maybe 10. I just found out a few hours ago that my mom had a brown belt in karate (1 test away from black), whereas I remember my mom telling me that she just did 3 months, then quit.

Now she's 30-50lbs overweight, depressed (enough for low-level medication), never leaves the house (telecommutes), had a minor heart attack two years ago (no heart damage) and I've been told that she's apparently borderline diabetic now. My sister (finished Ironman, vegan) and I have done our best to try to change her habits. My mom knows, without question, what healthy food and exercise is, she has like 50 books on it. She just doesn't do it.

As for my dad, I've always thought of him as being the coolest guy in the universe. Stoic, engineering degree, fit (for his age), works hard as fuck, made us top 1-percenters despite him being born on a farm, doesn't let his emotions screw him up, logical, brilliant chess player, 25 years karate experience, has a sense of humour, pays attention to the world, has informed opinions, and works out every day. My aunt doesn't think he's the best father, that he never made me food when I was young, but I still think when I was your age, I did X by myself are good lessons. My dad is a deal with it, work hard kind of guy, and even though he read 5 Ayn Rand books he told me that I read those 40 years ago, I agree with some of it, but she's really extreme.

I guess he's not an A+ father, but he's at least a B+ one. He pushed me to learn multiple languages (French, Mandarin, German), gave me a good work ethic, taught me the importance of discipline. He also taught me the value of money, that it doesn't necessarily make you happy, 

I always spend time with him, still go to movies with him, have games of chess. He brings us on vacations to Hawaii, Las Vegas, etc, etc, brings us to nice restaurants 2-3 times a month, etc. He's actually spending the weekend right now with my mother in San Francisco, and is bringing her with him to a business trip in Portland the weekend after.

According to my aunt and uncle, my dad treats my mom poorly. My aunt and uncle pointed out to me that whenever my dad uses the kitchen, he makes a massive mess and expects my mom to clean it, and he never takes out the trash (true). They also believe that my mom's poor eating habits come from my dad bringing food from restaurants home when they started dating, and that my mom used to be an amazing cook. Your dad has never **sat down** to eat, have you noticed that he's always standing at table? Even when I met your dad at a party before introducing him to your mother, he always stood around to eat.

They have also pointed out to me that apparently my dad would have never gotten us rich if it weren't for my mom's knowledge and experience with the stock market. Your dad isn't that healthy, sure, he's vegetarian and works out a lot, but have you paid attention to what he actually eats? Mexican food with cheese, green tea ice cream, maple syrup on his oatmeal, etc. Yeah, he's better than most his age, but he's not trim.

My aunt also told me: Don't be offended, but all of you do this, when was the last time the 4 of you sat down to have a meal? All of you guys graze throughout the day, just with different ideas on what to eat. The 4 of you need to sit down, actually cook for everyone instead of yourselves.

On the subject of my mom's health, my dad is very pessimistic. He once told me: I've been trying to get your mother to work out for 20 years. He knows the situation better than me, but he's never been good at addressing others failures (even my own) and being supportive. 

This all kinda came as a shock for me. I thought my dad was the coolest guy in the universe, and now I think he's a bit of an asshole. My uncle thinks my mom just needs a lot of support (maybe I've been doing it wrong), and my aunt thinks my mom can turn herself around.

The problem is, I know it's impossible to change other people. My mom has to want it. I know for sure that once she starts to feel better about her health and figure, the rest will take care of itself. At least my aunt and uncle think so.

18690,Non-Romantic,3fegci,"Sorry that this is so long, writing things out is helping me start to figure out what about this situation is frustrating me but I'd really appreciate some insight on how to deal with it. It's a shitshow.

Since I dropped out of university, I got a lot closer a friend of mine who we'll call Marco. We both spent a lot of time being socially awkward on IM as teenagers (me because I had been sexually assaulted and him because he was bullied at school. We both felt safer behind a computer screen) so talking a lot on facebook chat felt like a pretty natural progression. We were both in a period of upheaval which I think helped us bond. I have an anxiety disorder and he has depression so that was also some common ground. 

The longer I've got to know him, though, the more I've felt that some of his problems are very solvable. I'm not saying I expect him to make all the choices I think he should, I totally appreciate that he is his own person, but I've gradually started to feel like he digs himself into problems and then complains about them instead of solving them because solving them would be scary. 

I feel like I'm being a dick and assuming my mental health problems are reasonable because at any moment in time I can point to something that is causing the anxiety (aforementioned sexual abuse, upheaval from having a widowed addict as a parent, people in my family dying on such a frequent basis that I just keep a funeral dress on standby because I know odds are I'll be using it within a year, inheritance BS). I know that depression can be a hormonal issue or a case of really ingrained thought habits so I don't want to act like an arsehole over Marco's behaviour but it is starting to make me really resent him. He frequently goes on long rants about how badly his life is going. I used not to mind because I felt like he reciprocated when I needed to talk about the stuff that was stressing me out and I had the time and energy to act as a sounding board but I increasingly feel like he is tolerating talking to me about my stuff so he can talk about his own thing. Which makes me not want to talk about my life, a trade off that seems OK with because it gives him more time to talk about his stuff without me really getting much in return. I understand that depression can often be very circular, my boyfriend and several close friends of mine have/ had it, but this feels like it's on an entirely different level, it's so intense.

Marco also will also lie or pretend not to know stuff to manipulate people if he wants to get his emotional fix. Individually, the lies are usually small and pretty insignificant but I've only recently realised the extent to which he does it and feel kind of used. Maybe 2 months ago I was on a date with my boyfriend when he got a phone call from his parents saying that his next door neighbour, who they looked after a lot, had died and his Mum had found the body. He was really upset that his Mum had experienced that; my sibling found our Mum's body about 2 years ago so he knew from previous experience how hard it can be on a person and his Mum is quite a sensitive person at the best of times so he was naturally pretty concerned for her. We quickly put our heads together and decided that whilst I love and get along well with his parents, this was a situation where his Mum might be happier just spending time with her children so he went to spend the night at hers whilst I went home. On the way, Marco messaged me asking me about the date. I told him what had happened and he said he felt bad for my boyfriend and to tell him that he was thinking of him. I said that he'd already left and I didn't want to disturb but told my boyfriend in person the next time I saw him because I thought he'd appreciate knowing someone was thinking of him. My boyfriend was confused for a second and asked when I'd told Marco about his Mum. When I said it was a matter of maybe 30-40 minutes after we'd gone our seperate directions, he was very irritated.

It turns out that later that night, after my boyfriend had stayed late talking to his Mum to distract and comfort her, he decided to sleep at his parents and checked his phone as he was getting ready for bed. Marco was online and had ranted to my boyfriend about his life's troubles for 40 minutes before asking how things were with him and pretending that he was hearing about my boyfriend's Mum for the first time. My boyfriend felt pretty used by this, he was pretty emotionally drained from the situation with his Mum and couldn't believe that Marcus had known and decided to lean on him anyway.

I will be the first to admit that I have been holding a grudge over this without discussing it for way too long. My sibling finding my Mum's body is one of the worst things that has happened to me or my family and I have a massive soft spot for my boyfiend's parents. I also have a short temper for situations where I feel like my loved ones are being treated unfairly so this hit a lot of buttons for me. Logically, I know that Marco has a lot of emotional stuff going on, he's lonely and doesn't have that many people to talk to and probably felt like he **really** needed to get something off his chest but I'm finding it really hard not to feel angry about something so obviously manipulative. If he didn't pull this kind of shit, Marco would have a lot more options for people to talk to and this wouldn't even be an issue! He's digging himself into a hole and then complaining from the bottom of it that he doesn't have many friends and he doesn't understand why.

Like in a lot of dysfunctional friendships, we're in a grump with each other over something small and seemingly unrelated. He was ranting about his masters, got a bit too aggressive and I lashed out because aggression from men puts me on edge (working on that) and I felt like he was ignoring that so he could double down and shout at me when I had nothing to do with the issue at hand. It was dumb, he's since said he didn't mean to upset me but it was the straw that broke the camel's back and I really don't want to pick up where we left off unless something changes.

I like Marco, I think he has a lot going for him and I do legitimately want to see him succeed... but I really don't want to feel like I'm hanging out with him as an act of charity. He's a sweet guy but I'm increasingly feeling like he assumes that if he puts friendship coins in, reciprocation should come out without a lot of appreciation for the individual he's talking to. If a friendship doesn't develop then he gets frustrated and I **hate** feeling obligated. I don't want to feel like he's dependent on me and my support because now that I am angry at him and don't want to talk to him right now, I'm also a little worried about whether or not he has anyone to talk to and is handling his shit in a healthy way. Which makes me more annoyed because that is his responsibility, I don't know when he managed to make me feel like it was mine instead. I don't want to be his carer, I want to be his friend but I feel like I've been sucked into feeling obligated to give, which I hate. I was perfectly willing to offer the same support before but the obligation makes me not want to any more, especially when it is way more frequent than I feel is good for me. Normally I am great at establishing healthy boundaries and sticking to them but every time I draw a new one, he is over it within a week or two and I haven't even noticed. It's infuriating and makes me not want to talk to him but I like him and want this to work out. What do?

So as the title shows I'm a 23m living at home with my folks. I have an older brother(24) and older sister (26), the relationship between my sister and I is very unsettling to me and it was like this for my brother around the time of my age and *onward.* We clash a lot due to the distance in mentality and emotional stability ie personalities lol. I think that she fairly thinks poorly of me, how do I know this? Through a short dialogue I had with her a few years ago. 


Me: how long does this new course go for? (referring to her taking a uni course to be a HS teacher)


Sister:  3 to 4 years


M: Oh, wow okay. 


S: Longer than your one *(smug face)*


M: why would you say that? *(smile/questioning face)*


S: Because you don't like to study.


M: So, working and doing a certificate **and** night classes at college isn't studying? *(smug face)*


S: ha...*(more of a sigh)*
*BTW I'm looking at uni courses to do for this year lol*


I though boys have the struggle of emotional maturity but it seems like she is the one going through it at the moment...and the moment is a very long duration. She used to pick fights and/or provoke fights, and by fights I mean arguments with my brother when I was a bit younger...I used to stay out of it until one of them needed to clarify something in order to close the argument. Lately though it seems to have ceased or at least slow down to a point where it doesn't happen as often between my brother and my sister. But now it has picked up between my sister and I. I don't understand it. Why? 


A recent argument, and by recent I mean it literally just happened and I don't know what to make of it. At the end I clarified both our points, addressed it firmly and offered a solution for us both to take which was; *I will be more aware of everyone and their conversations and she will be/act more mature and be more aware of other people around her*. I have a heart to say that I don't think this solution will take affect. This is how the situation allegedly happened;
(For the sake of the situation lets call my sister Susan &amp; my mother Mary and I'll be mentioning myself and I or Me)


*I walk towards kitchen and see my sister and mother speaking and having a conversation in the dining room adjacent to the kitchen. I walk thru the kitchen and towards the backroom*


Susan: how'd you go, (insert name)? *(apparently she asked the question here, but I heard them two stop talking when I was in the backroom)*
*I walked into the other room, check what I needed to check and see if we had something I wanted or if we didn't. I obviously didn't pay attention to their conversation since I don't like pplz eves dropping. I believes that's how pplz hear things incorrectly and spread those incorrect intel to others and/or the conversation has to start all over again when all of a sudden the person eves dropping shows interest and asks what are you talking about?!*
*I walk back into the kitchen*


Susan: Fine then, I'm gonna ignore *you* now *(her back was to me. thought she was talkin to my mother)*


Me: What did you do *(I jokingly ask my mother as I thought she said that to her)*


Mary: She was talking to you *(kind of a smug look on her face, and never made eye contact with me, she kept her eyes on my sister)*


Me: Me? What? Why would you ignore me, Su? *(I asked my sister as I opened the fridge to get a drink. I was genuinely confused and thinking they could be 
playing around. So I kept it light and asked her to see if she would actually ignore me. A slight silence for about 2-3 seconds)*


Mary: She asked you a question and you ignored her *(still no eye contact and that smug look still as if I always ignore'em so I deserve this kinda treatment)*


Me: When? *(pouring myself a glass of cold water)*


Mary: Just now. *(still not looking at me, my sisters back towards me) 


Me; Oh? What did you ask, Su? *(still keeping it light as I drank some water. I'm talking to Susan and asking her questions and my mother is answering for her like she knows every little word of breath that she would have said in the past, in the present and in the future)*


*Silence filled the room with still no answer for about 5 seconds.*


Susan; Don't worry. *(they walk away from me and towards the living room)*


*I'm just thinking What the hell*


Me: Hang on. Don't ignore me now. I just asked you what you said before.


*ignores me as they sit in the living room, separate from each other. I asked and looked at my sister*


Mary: she asked how'd you go, again? *(I turn to look at her. She has an annoyed look on her face, possibly from answering the questions FOR my sister or having to answer MY questions)*


Me: Oh. Yeah it went well, Su. *(I looked back at her. She has a smug look and has her iphone in her hand and is still ignoring me)*


Me: You still gonna ignore me for no reason? *(I kind of chuckle at the situation that she is trying to act this way towards me)*


Mary: You ignored her before.


Now this is the part of the situation that gets out of hand. We trace back and restep what happened, while arguing of cause. I mention the miscommunication and also the misquote from my mother (if you missed it read it again ^) and shit hits the fan! My side of the argument to my sister was act/be more mature in situations like this. Don't be immature and just pout and say I'm ignoring you now when we established I at least didn't hear you asking me a question and also I heard you two stop talking while I was in the backroom, and you said I was in the kitchen when you asked me. Her side of the argument was I should have heard her since she thought she said it loud enough for me to hear and answer back and of cause You were in the kitchen when I asked. As soon as I mentioned the misquote from my mother, which was towards the end of the argument, she flipped it and got angry and said she DIDN'T MISQUOTE ANYBODY and I DON'T MISQUOTE PEOPLE!! When I made it clear that she actually did when they were sitting down, when I mentioned that as well they both went quiet and Susan had a dumb look on her face and said what are you talking about? with her fone still in her hand. She was either being stupid on purpose to dismantle my argument, trying to make me look stupid/bad, didn't actually pay attention to my side of the argument or trying to get me angry/frustrated. 


We ended it with screaming and yelling and our closing arguments were; 



Susan: be more aware of those around you and those who are talking to you *(also saying this in a smug and snotty tone of voice and movement in body language ie hands raising and circular motion, showing of the teeth more for half the words etc)
Me: Act and be more mature, instead of childish. Instead of pouting and saying I'm ignoring you now to what you thought was *me ignoring you,* be mature. I will be more aware of everyone and what they are saying, ok? And you try not to act poorly like this in situations because it got mother involved as a third party and now she's angry



It ended and I walked away, too much tension and negative energy is what I try to avoid (guess it's not working lol). About 5 mins later my mother calls for me, I reply. She says they are leaving for about an hr and a half. I ask where they headed (tryna see if they just want to avoid me by leaving or something), she says Susan has to drop something off. It takes 1.5hrs to drop something off? lol it's possible she's telling the truth here and avoiding having to tell me what else they going to do but really? Where is this place that something needs to be dropped off there....Indonesia?! 


So at the end I asked/said *So no one is in the wrong here but is that true? Tell me what you think? What I in the wrong in certain areas? Was my sister? These types of arguments about miscommunication usually involve my sister on the other end, whether it's between my brother and her or me and her.

My parents separated five years ago, and every week since it has been a ridiculous back and forth of them accusing one another of being terrible, and it's starting to drive me a little insane.

I feel like this occurs often with divorcees; both of them are trying to make the other look like the bad guy. My dad claims my mother 'only wants to help him when it's convenient for her', while she claims that 'every time he gets a new girlfriend he starts thinking that he can control her'. 

They are constantly in a stalemate over problems that are affecting my younger brothers and I, only because they are too petty to work it out. They shouldn't be fighting about our schedule for staying at their houses. They shouldn't be fighting about who has one kids clothing, even though it was said kid's fault that the clothing was left at one house in the first place. They definitely shouldn't be complaining about one another to us. 

Every time I try to tell them to stop being stupid, they come up with excuses and somehow turn it around to be the other's fault. They can't communicate properly. I've yelled at them (more than once) to seek counselling, but my mom says my dad won't do it, and my dad says that my mom never asked him in the first place. I am so angry, I can't stand it any more. Every single week we have the same conversation. I AM NOT A COUNSELLOR. I should not be the one they are complaining to! 

I would also like to add, while I'm here, that my mom is a complete victim blamer, and I don't know how to make her stop. She once told me after raising money to buy a puppy, knowing the responsibilities that came with it, and after having confessed to her that the reason I wanted a dog was because I was lonely and I thought a dog would make me happy (my dad already has a dog at his place), that I was the one in charge of my own happiness. Are you kidding me? After she talked about having depression throughout her third pregnancy, and for three years of their separation, she is trying to tell me that I am in charge of my own happiness? Well maybe, but every time I try to take charge of my own happiness, she is there trying to stomp it back into the dirt! No wonder I have anxiety! 

Neither of them are bad people, but right now they are focusing too much on what the other is doing wrong. They're both wrong. 

I'm sorry if I sound like I'm overreacting, and if I crammed a whole bunch of info into a little bit of text, and some of it doesn't make sense. I'm just so tired of dealing with this all the time. I need a second opinion. I need to vent. If you read this, thanks. If you didn't, it's fine.

Thanks in advance for reading.  I was not really sure where to pose this question - any advice welcome. (Only became a redditer recently, so apologies for poor formatting or breaking any rules of reddiquette.)

I am a 25-year old male, and graduated from undergrad a few years ago.  I was on a NSFW subreddit recently and found a pic of someone I know from college.  She's not really a friend per se, and is a few years younger, but we run in the same circles and have been friendly whenever we've chatted (she's a super sweet girl).  

The photo is not nude, but is of her in a bikini, and I think was taken from her facebook.  Based off of the user's history, I do not believe it was her posting her own picture.  

Is this something I should bring up to her?  Is there a way to do it without embarrassing her?  What if she is aware of the post, and is more embarrassed by the fact that someone she knows saw it than by the fact that it was put up in the first place?  What's the best way to have this conversation? And if the picture was taken from her facebook, it's already public - to what extent would this bother her? Should I try and get it taken down before I even tell her?

Bonus topic - obviously, my first priority is to save her any embarrassment.  However, if there's a way to broach the subject that doesn't start with So I was looking at some dirty pictures on the internet and..., that would be preferable. I know, I know, it's not unusual in this day and age, but still.

Oh, side note - we're both of Indian descent, and it was a subreddit dedicated to Indian girls.  I don't think that actually makes any difference to anything. She's definitely attractive. Again, probably irrelevant.

18743,Non-Romantic,3dtlvm,"I want to start by saying I don't think she means it in a hurtful way, but it still bothers me and I don't know how to tell her to stop. This post is a bit long, but I have to explain it properly.

My bf and I have been dating for more than 5.5 years and I've known my bf's mom for just as long. When my bf and I started dating,  I was very naive and ignorant of safe sex and stds and although I always used protection with my ex bfs, it was because I didn't want to get pregnant. With my bf, he suggested we used the pull out method as he was very good at it (still naive). Because of that, we didn't use condoms all the time. 

1.5 years after dating and having sex, I ended up in the emergency room with severe abdominal pain. They found I had PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) and most likely I've had chlamydia since I first had unprotected sex with my partner (my bf and I didn't do stds tests and he hadn't always used protection with ex partners like I had). With ultrasounds and the blood tests/fluid samples/uterine exams, my doctor put me in really strong antibiotics and I was in pain for about a month and had recurrent abdominal pains for 2 more years afterwards as residual pain and still  get them but less frequently as before. She also told me that due to the severity and period of time I've had it (1.5 years untreated), I have very low chances of getting pregnant and high chances of miscarriage. Because of the symptoms I presented and the ultrasound, I had scarred tissue in my fallopian tubes and uterus. To the degree that I 100% couldn't have children? She said that required very invasive procedures and I had gone through enough. Basically I had a chance, but much much smaller than everyone else. At 19, that was very devastating for me to hear and I really regret not being well informed back then. I also informed my bf of what the doctor said and asked him if that affected his view of our relationship (in terms of maybe not having biological children) and he said it was fine. 

Fast forward 4 years, and I've learned to accept the fact I might not be able to have children, or that it will be extremely difficult in our case. If we do get to have our children through our genes, I will be pleasantly surprised but it's not something I kid myself in thinking is how it's going to happen. This is how I chose to cope with it.

3 days ago I was with my bf's mom and she was telling me how my bf's half brother didn't want children ever (he's 18 so that's expected at that age) and how my bf's dad side of the family had all suffered from some level of infertility due to low sperm count and they had a lot of difficulties having children. I said that was fine, as I had the same issue in that I had low probabilities of getting pregnant due to issues in my reproductive organs (she doesn't need to know her son gave me chlamydia). She asked if through in vitro we could,  and I said I think so but that I also think it's very expensive and I wouldn't do it many times. 

Now, in my head I thought since she is telling me my bf has issues with infertility, she wouldn't make a big deal out of me having issues with it. I actually shared it with her because I'm not embarrassed or ashamed that I have that problem. Through reddit, I've found that people think it's taboo to admit it, because it affects their identity as a woman and her womanhood. By having years to deal with it, I no longer identify fertility with my womanhood, as many women do.

Now, I regret telling her. My bf's mom didn't take the news very well. Apparently it's okay for her son to have fertility issues but it's not okay for me to have them. She freaked out on my bf after I left and my bf to calm her down said it wasn't as bad and I just exaggerated. I asked my bf why he said I exaggerated as he had been with me when I ended up in the emergency rooms, all the tests, weeks of antibiotics, the side effects and long term effects of having PID (which are a lot unfortunately). He said telling his mom she couldn't have grandkids is not the same as her saying it will be hard to have grandkids. I said I didn't tell her we wouldn't have, I just said it might be harder because we BOTH had issues. I told him I also told her I would try in vitro if I had to. He said he would've preferred she didn't know at all about our issues and I apologized for not thinking about how he would feel with his mom knowing. 

The issue now is that his mom, twice, has brought up how I'm having her grandkids and how I'm giving birth (it's really intense). I always just joke about it when she brings it up or smile and don't say anything. I mean, I might have them, but I don't want to think about it now (we are not even trying) and I feel like now she wants reassurance that she will have her mini me and mini bf and I don't want to do that. She wants me to play along in how she pictures I'll be in the delivery room with my bf and for me, I don't even know if that will happen. Up til now, she always knew my bf would have fertility issues. Why bringing this baby talk now???

What should I do? Should I just play along with her fantasy,  even though it makes me uncomfortable or should I talk to my bf again about maybe telling her we're not thinking about babies right now so we don't want to talk about it

TL;DR; at 19 I got treated with long term untreated PID and was told I had scarring in my reproductive organs and had high probabilities of infertility. I confided in my bf's mom I might have fertility issues once she told me she believed my bf had fertility issues. She did not take it well and keeps bringing up scenes where I'm having her grandkids and wants reassurance of that.

18744,Non-Romantic,39vaj0,"My family and I recently experienced two deaths (one was my dad's sister and the other was a friend who was like a mom to us and sister to my parents).  We're all very heartbroken, but my dad doesn't talk about his feelings much.  Instead, he resorts to drinking very heavily whenever he's feeling emotions that are not positive.

His alcoholism is something that's been happening for as long as my parents have been married (35 or so years now), but certain periods in our lives have been more difficult with drinking than others.  

This is going to be one of those times because I came home after offering to get him a prescription from the pharmacy to a house that smelled like smoke and a toaster oven that was burnt quite badly.  Needless to say, he was drunk.  There have been dozens of other examples over the course of my life including saying that he's going to drive while drunk (to which I've threatened to end the relationship if he did that), drinking to the point of intoxication in the early afternoon, falling down and hitting his head, and classic other signs of alcoholism.  These are only some examples that have happened within the last year or so.

It's not something that a lot of people in my life (except one friend that I've known forever) and my immediate family know the extent of.  Most people know that my dad loves to drink, but nothing like the examples shared above.  He's a very generous guy (one of the most generous people that I've ever met in my life), he has a strong set of values, he is hardworking, intelligent, and has many other positive traits, but this aspect of him is not one of them.

I don't have anyone to really talk to about this, but it feels like another stressor that I'm going to deal with for quite some time.  I can't babysit my dad, he's 65 years old, he's very stubborn and doesn't think he has a problem.  I don't know how to talk to him when he's sober (which is mostly during the day).  Once in my life, I did talk to him about it because he asked me if I thought he was an alcoholic and I told him that it was up for him to figure that out, but from what I know that he was a functioning one.  He tried to justify it by saying things like, I'm not out drinking at bars, I have a job, I'm not on the streets, and all these other drastic examples..

But, I have done a lot of research and the research tells me otherwise..My question is: what can I do in this position?  I'm lucky that I came home when I did otherwise the house could have burnt if the toaster caught on fire and the fire spread.  His drinking is only going to lead to worse effects because he's older now and his body can't tolerate it the same way that he could even 5-10 years ago..

For what it's worth, my sister's a nurse and has explained the logical side to him, but it's just like he can't seem to drill it in his head.

18747,Non-Romantic,2z5kxy,"   So I decided to make this post after another incident today. I know this is stupid and illegal, but I have a snapchat just for sending mass nudes. A lot of times, guys share it with their friends and they add me as well, so that's what I always assume when I get random friend requests on there. Well today I was checking something and noticed one guy I had recently deleted was MY DAD, because of the contacts feature on snapchat I saw his name above that username. I am so angry right know. I know for a fact he knew exactly what he was doing when he secretly added me, and knowingly opened and screenshotted several pics of me. I don't know what to do. I want to tell someone, but at the same time I don't want to get in trouble. I also feel like if I did bother telling he would just make up some excuse. There is more to this though, this is only the most recent example. 


   Ever since I was about 14/15 i began to notice this weird behavior from him. He would always be trying to catch me watching porn. Very creepy. I also used to skype guys up until about a year ago, which yes I know is something I shouldn't have been doing. He caught on to this. He would then start trying to catch me doing that and pretend it was an accident. And apparently he would spend large amounts of time trying to stumble on pictures and videos of me on the Internet. He would get so excited and show me....it kind of makes me wonder if he hacked my web camera and took these himself. Either way it's creepy. What dad spends that much time trying to find porn of their daughter? I have no proof of this, but I'm 99% sure he would silently stand in the halls and the bathro by my room to hear me masturbate. If he caught on that I noticed or that I had finished, I would hear quick sudden footsteps and doors slamming. So yeah I have my suspicions about that and it doesn't seem that far fetched he'd be doing something like that. He has never physically done anything. Only once did he come close. He was drunk and attempted to pull my underwear down while rubbing himself. I began to cry and get loud though so he stopped. He brushed it off and acted as if nothing happened. 


   Recently, as in the fall of 2014 things got way worse. I found out he was reading my conversations and things on my computer after I went to sleep. I only found out because I woke up to him leaning over me one night and visibly excitedly pulling up a picture of me giving someone a blowjob. I was in shock. I can only imagine the things he may have been possibly doing while I was asleep, I don't even want to think about it. He later admitted to me that he has been doing this for YEARS. Around this time he learned I was sexually active (obviously from going through my computer constantly I guess). He would ask me things like how I lost my virginity, and how old the guy was, and how many. He constantly commented that he knew my type and that he knows I love old men. He would offer me his keys to sneak out at night, and tell me he would cover for me whenever I needed him to.  He even told me I should let him pick out the guys I fuck. The worst was probably when he literally begged me to fuck a tranny in exchange for a new car. WHAT THE FUCK??? I ended up getting into a huge argument with him where he admitted to wanting to fuck me, and told me it was all my fault. He said it was my responsibility to hide my computer and he can't control himself. Disgusting right? He said he had read I had incest fantasies, so that must obviously mean I want it. He claimed it was just natural biology to be attracted to me. My relationship with him has never been the same since then. I actually avoid being alone with him, my mom even began to notice but I told her nothing was wrong because I was scared of getting in trouble.


   This winter my depression got bad enough that I had to go to a psychologist. I honestly feel like he is a big part of my problem, but I don't want to tell anyone, because again I am afraid of getting in trouble and what the consequences for our family might be. There is a little bit more to what I've explained, but that basically explains the majority of the major incidents I have had with him.

18754,Non-Romantic,35053r,"Been dating my girlfriend for a year and things are amazing - I've never been happier. The argument with my friend stemmed from plans for May 24 weekend. He and 4 mutual friends (one of which is a couple, all who know and like my girlfriend) are getting a hotel and barhopping for the night. He invited me along, and said he'd prefer my girlfriend not to come as it's a bro's night. I told him that's not fair to her, a large portion of our friend group is going out, and there's another couple so it's definitely not a bro night. In the 10 years I've known him, he's never had a girlfriend. He said that he sometimes feels left out when my girlfriend and I do things without him too.


This led into him saying how my girlfriend always joins in on whatever we do (not true at all - when she does I'll ask him first and he says it's fine), how she tries to change plans (not true), and all of this other stuff. He says he never gets to hang out with me (also not true. we both work full time and he's seen me 3 days in the last week. I will admit only one of which was without my girlfriend, but he had no problem with that at the time). He said he loves her, but wants some time where we can hang as just friends. I get it - and I told him that. I explained that he just needs to say he wants a bro night and it's not an issue, however a weekend trip with a large group of people excluding my girlfriend is different. Now he's not talking to me.

18769,Non-Romantic,299opy,"As mentioned in the title, my friend and I have been friends for seventeen years. Our families are very close, we went to the same school growing up, we go to the same university, we've traveled abroad together...I've grown up with this girl. Before I begin I should say that she's a very good friend; she's funny, trustworthy, I feel like I can confide in her. However, she has a really negative attitude to the point where it can be exhausting to spend time with her. I never know how to respond to her negative remarks, and would like some insights. 

She seems to get into these cycles of negativity. Something unfortunate will happen to her, she magnifies the problem and blows it way out of proportion, and then she ties it into greater insecurities she has (usually about being average or mediocre). For example, a few weeks ago she was having issues with registering for classes. She would message me things like, If I get on the wait list for any classes I'm graduating in 2.5 years and not 2. I'm so done. I don't even want to finish. I said to her that she won't find out what will happen until she meets with administration, and in the mean time all she can do is prepare herself for the meeting and look into alternative options if she can't get her way (maybe a lame response, but I didn't know what to say). She replied with, I've never had a good meeting with them, they always screw me over. Why do I even bother? Everything is just a big stressful headache. And God knows I'll never be anything better than average at best. 

She also likes to almost one-up other people's misfortunes and counter good news with bad news. If I say that I'm feeling under the weather she says something along the lines of she's had the *worst* cold for three weeks and needs to go to the doctor because her meds aren't working. If I say that a cute guy asked for my number, she'll say something about how that's awesome and then follow with a comment about how she's going to die alone. 

I'm generally a pretty optimistic person, and I'm just not sure how I should deal with all of the negative comments. I do get the sense that she has some self-esteem issues, but I don't know how to respond to her self-deprecating remarks. When I try to offer advice, she immediately shoots it down. If I try to just lend an ear and listen to her problems, she begins to say things about how she's going to die alone, how she hates her body/looks, how she's destined to mediocre, etc. I don't agree with the way that she sees herself, but if I tell her those things definitely aren't true she doesn't listen.

The third day I have been working with her, she was telling me about her ex-husband and how he emotionally and physically abused her - I know exactly how horrible it is to be abused, to have someone you love being abused; I am not limiting her issue to any extent whatsoever) ... I thought it was kind of odd that she'd tell me literally every detail about it, but it felt like she needed to talk about it, so I listened.

She proceeded to tell me about her daughter, and how the girl has been suicidal, etc etc.

Our profession is social studies and teaching. 

This woman ... ever since then, will talk NON-STOP! SHE WILL NOT SHUT UP! It seriously makes my work 300 times harder than it actually is.

I AM EXHAUSTED! I am writing in caps because I have no words to describe my frustration ... she will talk about anything and everything **into every possible detail you can think of** - she will mention every person's profession she's speaking about. She will tell me about all the things she's studied in the past but never finished because this and that, this is why she did this and that; over and over again! (I will have to tell her that she's already told me about it before at least twice a day - reminds me of my emotionally abusive ex).


AGAIN: I am so exhausted. 
I want to do my work, look for and after the kids, work with them ... she does her job as well, but she will do the talk.

I cannot recall her asking me one single question besides ONE question: asking me over and over again to go to theatre with her. That's the only thing she's focused on.

I cannot believe how one person can talk so much that it exhausts me to this extent. I am not qutie sure if anyone has ever made this experience before, but ... this is unbearable.

It's been 4 months ... and I am thinking about looking for a new job. I only work with her on 3 days in the afternoon, and yet - it's too much for me.

**Important Edit**: first of all THANK YOU! Thank you for the kind advice and taking the time to read my wall of text. I forgot to add something very important though: we (the co-worker and I) work in a class, there is no desk-situation - we go outside occassionally, so while the kids are working or playing ... she will talk, talk talk. Once one of my kids got injured (nothing serious at all, she was able to keep playing with the other children) - so when the girl walked by us I would ask the girl if she's alright / doing any better .. and the girl would whine a little and say not really ... so my Co-Worker would say Sometimes it's better to not ask - maybe she's right ... kids are kids, they will forget about things easily, but the girl was still holding onto a wet papertowel on her eye ... I wanted to make sure she's ok. 

It seems this woman is right ABOUT EVERYTHING, there's nothing she doesn't know, and so her profession (teacher) is great for her ... I noticed that whenever I would speak against her opinion she'd get sort of pissed???!!! WOW. I really have no idea what is going on with this person.

18787,Non-Romantic,2pw816,"As I said I far as I can remember my mom has been a narcissist-actually not only is she narcissistic she is bipolar and has menopause-   and I can't really take it anymore. 

One example of her being narcissistic is if my brother and I get in an argument she will stop us when we are starting to prove her wrong and then she will tell us I'm not going to argue with you and then proceed to sit there and tell us what we did wrong while we have to sit there and listen to it. 

She also has been just getting into arguments with us and then playing with our dog 5 minutes later like nothing happened and then coming back to us yelling or scolding again. It happens way to often not to be mentioned. 

To go on she won't let us watch videos with swearing in it just because she things it's ungodly like. She also after I turned 17 told me even though I was old enough to play rated M games she wouldn't allow it. My brother on the other hand played rated M games before he turned 17 and she never made a comment about it. 

One point I had a girlfriend around homecoming (as far as I know I never really told her we were dating but she caught on quickly we were) but she told me she didn't want me in a stable relationship. A few days after homecoming pictures were posted on Facebook and one of the pictures were of me kissing my gf on the cheek and when my mom saw it she apparently stomped up the stairs went into her room and slammed her door shut is what my brother told me. When I came home it looked like she had been bawling or something and whenever she told me whatever she told me she went into her room and shut it again.

I saw no reason other than it to be that since she never really explained what it was. A few weeks after her seeing the picture my girlfriend and I broke up and she seemed cheered up like she just got told she had won like a thousand dollars or something. She tried to mask it by saying Are you two back together now? but it didn't really work out. 

One thing that she does very often and highly annoys me is that she plays with my dog. She start to howl with my dog and then do it as loud as she possibly can just to make sure everyone in the neighborhood can hear it. She also will do things like Daddy's coming home, Daddy's coming home, Daddy's coming home whenever my dad texts her that he left work or something. She will constantly do stuff similar to that and I have tried to ask her once to kindly to stop while she was doing it but she just proceeded to howl louder.

She also always constantly wants to touch me (no not there) she will constantly want to touch me on the shoulder, arm, so on so forth and I will always ask her Can you please not? but she replies with No I'm your mother I can touch you whenever I want. 

Some people might think hormones might just be affecting me but I really doubt they are the main problem but they might be mixed in. My brother is older then me and he has noticed that she is worse with me then she is with him and he says that whenever he gets his own place than I welcome to come whenever I want and welcome to also move in if I would like. I hope I really don't have to do that but I will if it comes to it.

18789,Non-Romantic,2mubyb,"I was supposed to move in to an apartment and the day before the move it fell through. At the time my baby was six days old and my brother very generously let me, my husband, new baby, cat and dog stay with him. He gave us his master bedroom and stayed in the spare while we stored things in his garage. We stayed there a month then rented an apartment which we knew wouldn't be permanent but would at least get us out of my brother's home. 

So when we move he says his son is quite attached to my kitty and we should come get the cat in a week or two. I, stupidly, agree to this because he has been so generous that I want to be nice and anyway, the new apt is a crappy place for a cat so I say okay, you can keep him while we unpack. The next time I see my brother and ask about kitty and every time after that he says 'oh, kitty can stay a little longer'. 

We stayed at that apt for about 6 weeks, during which I was figuring out the whole 'mom' thing and going through some serious sleep deprivation and depression, and then found our current place which is beautiful, long term, and has everything kitty needs. I've texted my brother saying I'd like kitty back and while he hasn't refused he also hasn't returned kitty. The last time I spoke to him he mentioned that his son, who is 6, is very attached and if I took back my cat he would have to get a kitten. 

Some key points - his son is spoiled out of his mind and is a real brat. My brother will do anything the kid wants. The cat was born in my arms and has been with me for over a decade. Oh, during that decade my brother didn't speak to me at all - he didn't approve of my life choices and after our father passed he cut me off. We reconnected as adults once I had a career and a husband and while I don't hold a grudge about the rift, I also feel much closer to my cat than to my brother. Since our reconnect he has been a great brother. I had a very difficult pregnancy and he was very supportive throughout it. 

Soooo. I don't know. Do I let him have the cat? I miss my kitty so much and I'm angry that we all have to kowtow to his 6 year old's needs. But I also don't want to be ungrateful and cause him drama with his family when he has been so generous to mine. Some days i'm tempted to get on a bus and go kidnap my cat and others I just think I should let him go. Even now I want to cry because if something happened to kitty and I couldn't say goodbye I'd be heartbroken but then I think 'suck it up and go take care of your baby.'

18798,Non-Romantic,2lr09v,"My ex wife is very....difficult. And not the most responsible or easiest person to get along with. 

Our marriage basically ended when I went to the doctor and found out I had an STD (thankfully curable) that I acquired from one of my ex's lover's while she was out of her mind on LSD and tequila. She's also been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. 

Just thought I'd give a quick peek into the kind of person she is and why she doesn't have a whole lot of custody of my kids or the other three she birthed in her subsequent two marriages after mine that also ended in divorce. 

Long story short, she's in a rehab/recovery program and has been clean (on illegal drugs at least) for a few years and has proven to the courts she is capable and has the right to have our kids every other weekend and every Wednesday night.

Here's the thing. My kids hate her. I feel bad they have such a rotten mom (I never talk bad about her in front of them) but unfortunately she is what she is. She never wants to spend time with them, she's always out running around or trying to hook up with her boyfriend of the month and is otherwise very disinterested in being a mother.

I suspect the only reason she wants to have custody at all is for the fat child support check I have to send (she consistently works shitty part time jobs or not at all to avoid having it taken away) every month.

I, on the other hand, am very close with my kids. We ride bikes, do puzzles, play mini golf, Settlers of Catan, the works. I love my children dearly.

But I also find myself sometimes looking forward to Wednesday nights and every other weekend. I like to have a break from sibling fights, constant requests to help with homework, driving them EVERYWHERE, having to get up extra early to take them to school or a sporting event AND get myself to work on time, cooking dinner, doing a massive amount of laundry and the overall chaos the comes with having three older kids in the house at one time.

I like being able to watch the TV...without hassles to change the channel or constant interuptions. I like to just have a microwave meal instead of having to prep and cook a full dinner. I like to be able to sleep in and have some peace and quiet for once, without video games, fighting or teenage sarcasm and drama spewing from every mouth.

Hell, I'd like to just be able to go on a DATE just once in awhile.

And don't get me wrong, my kids are great. They've got good grades, are popular in school and good at sports. But they are still tweens/teens.

I feel a lot of guilt and wonder how can I love my kids so much but also really look forward to the occasional breaks I get from them. Especially considering they hate going over to thier mom's.

My kids have begged me to let them stay with me full time, that they'd be willing to testify in court they'd like me to have full custody of them (the youngest can't but the middle and oldest are old enough to do so).

While not having to pay child support would be really nice, I do like and feel like I almost need those 8 days a month they spend with thier mom instead of me. I love my kids, but I've been an almost full time single dad for almost a decade now, and I feel like I'm burning the candle at both ends.

But I also feel bad about my hesitation and telling them several times a month No you need to spend some time with your mom, she doesn't get to see you much and all thier protests about how she never likes having them over anyway.

My father sharply critiscized me and said he never got to have a break while raising me and my siblings and that being a father means making sacrifices and having your children with you on a daily basis. However he had my mother to help him out and I've got to weather this storm alone?

Am I entitled to a few days out of the month to myself or do I need to suck it up and get full custody of my kids? I don't want to be a bad father but I really don't know how I'm going to handle never having a break from three boistrous teens.

I've gotten pretty fed up with her over the years. I've been thinking about ending it for a long while. If you asked me what was wrong with her, I wouldn't even know where to begin. 


These are just a few things off the top of my head:



-She is a pathological liar and a GOOD one; I've seen her lie ruthlessly to her parents and other people without blinking an eye. I can only imagine what she's lied to me about

-She cannot contain what I think is jealousy...if you read my last post, then you know that she shat a brick because her friends like me and invite me to parties

-She is incredibly self-serving in every way. I don't remember the last time she put someone other than herself first.

-I believe she is a little homophobic; she never took me seriously from the first day I told her I was attracted to women. She's acted as if none of my girlfriends were real relationships

-She is incredibly mean and disrespectful to her parents. She has regular screaming matches with them and she is completely unreasonable and too proud to apologize. She's made her mom cry on several occasions by just yelling at her (even in front of me)

-She's ungrateful - this part has more to do with her parents. Her parents are old, retired, spoil the shit out of their only child and she still treats them like pond scum

-Sometimes it feels like she is actively trying to bring me down

-EVERYTHING is a competition with her! Who's skinnier, who's prettier, who goes to a better school, who has nicer shit, etc.

-She loves to talk about herself so as a result, we almost always only talk about her

-She acts really different when we are around other people as opposed to when we are alone; she has no problem throwing me under the bus or making me the butt of her jokes when we are around people she wants to impress

-I've seen lots of her friends come and go over the years; I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who's stuck around consistently



Examples of specific incidents:



-One time, she cussed out her dad, in front of MY dad, at MY house, over something really trivial

-One time, I really wanted to buy this jacket for myself on sale and she told me don't worry, I already bought it for you! so I didn't but it turns out she didn't either (she lied and then denied it)

-For Christmas, we always get each other huge presents with lots of different components. We usually agree on an equal amount of gifts for each other beforehand, for obvious reasons. She has always lied about how many gifts she's bought me to, I imagine, score more shit from me

-In the middle of Christmas dinner, she outed me to her parents completely out of nowhere and told them I was gay. I did not give her permission to do this and I did not want her parents to know, considering that they are quite a bit older (60's) and very conservative. set in their ways, if you will

-One time, one of her friends said to me you have mad cake I had no clue what it meant, she told me that he meant to say I was fat. Later, I asked him what he meant and he said he meant I have a nice butt and that she definitely knew what cake meant, as they are from the same town and use the same slang that is unique to that town

-She made fun of me for wearing colored contacts. A week later, she was wearing them as well and denied having ever said anything negative about them (the same story applies to about 90% of my possessions)

-I was sexually assaulted by a drug dealer. When I told her about it, she lectured me for making terrible life choices and being out of control


There's a lot more to her than what I wrote about. ^ is just what I could think of off the top of my head. So, you and I both know that she's a bad friend and quite possibly a bad person. My only question is, should I end it now or hear her out?


Since our last fight, she's contacted me to talk. Right now, she's on a month long trip to Asia. This was her message:

Hey, I'm sorry I haven't texted. I ended up spending the last week in the hospital for an allergic reaction and from having the glass shower door shatter on top of me. I wasn't trying to ignore you. I reread our conversation and realized that I was upset with you but wasn't clear why, so I'm really sorry about that. It was hard to text while in class and I wasn't clear with what I was uncomfortable with. I'd love to talk later today and just clear everything up. I'm not mad, and I'm sorry for overreacting. I really do wanna be friends, cause you're one of the best I've ever had: please let me know when would be a convenient time to talk


In this text, she seems super level-headed and emotionally sound. It doesn't even sound like her. Maybe she's finally maturing. This text makes it sound like she deserves my attention and forgiveness but her behavior over the past 7 years suggests the opposite. What do you guys think?

We have 3-day conventions every year, and I've always gone with her. But this time, I am not going with her. She's never left me home alone for more than a day, and she is absolutely against leaving me here for 3. She's mainly concerned because I have a boyfriend (19M, been together for about a year and a half), and she doesn't want us to be alone together. It's against her conscience, and she has said that if we are ever alone together it's grounds for my eviction.

She gave me 3 options. First, my dad (her ex-husband) could come over and babysit me. I don't feel at all comfortable with my father for personal reasons. Second, my grandparents would babysit me. They live two hours away. The option that she's most pushing is for me to come with her. She feels most comfortable with this because then she'll know where I am and stuff.

All of these options make me feel like a child. I've been planning to move out for a while, and I'm almost ready to now, so being babysat seems humiliating and frustrating to me. What should I do?

18829,Non-Romantic,36ekvu,"The building that I live in is two stories, with apartments on the top and bottom (ground) floors.  The stairs to get to my apartment are on the outside of my building, and lead up to a small landing where my apartment door and my neighbor's door are.

Right below us is a family with a few kids -- I'm not sure how many.  These kids play with the other neighborhood kids outside all the time, screaming and yelling and generally doing kid stuff.  I have no problem with their noise when they're playing in the street and such.

However, sometimes these kids will run up and down the stairs leading to my apartment or sit on the landing, which is directly outside my living room window.  The stairs are old and metal and make an awful clanging noise when they're played on, and when the kids are on the landing I can hear every word they say as if they were sitting in the room with me.  I've asked them not to play on the stairs and they usually listen right after I tell them (sometimes they wait 10-15 minutes and then leave), but they come back after a week or so.

My question is: Do I have the right to be annoyed by this?  These kids have no reason to be on the stairs -- they lead only to mine and my neighbor's apartment, and she lives alone.  Like I said, I have no problem with kid noise in general, but damn, this is driving me crazy.  Should I go to the parents about it, or will I sound like a nagging neighbor?  I want to live here for a long time, so I want to have good relationships with my neighbors.

18831,Non-Romantic,2r0irv,"I met my friend, whos name I'll leave out, when she was dating another friend of mine. They broke up, but I still remained friends with her. I don't tend to pick sides, and made it known that I was still just as much his friend as I was hers. I still keep in contact with him, but we weren't super close before, so its not like I increased the amount that I talked to him.



My friend and I, when she isn't dating someone, text usually every night. We don't have time to throughout the day, and we will very occasionally call each other or meet up in real life. She usually asks me for a lot of advice, and I've always found myself in that role in friendships, so I don't really have a problem with it. I answer he questions and my honesty has led to a few fights, but I've explained to her multiple times that she needs to appreciate that I have worked on my honesty over the years, and am not as brutal as I once was, but I'm not perfect, either.



Anyways, shes a typical teenage girl who has a ton of guys chasing her, she is very beautiful, but I talk to her because I like her as a person. she is extremely flirty (I'm assuming this is just a teenage girl thing? I never went through this phase myself, but that doesn't mean others don't) and doesn't believe me when I have told her in the past, and usually gets really offended, stops talking to me for awhile, etc etc.



In the beginning of our relationship I was going through a really tough time myself, but didn't open up to her because of the long drawn out breakup that she was first going through. I wanted to be there for her. eventually, I got very upset and told her that I can't handle solving all of her lifes problems(she would come to me with EVERYTHING, as if I had to sort out the messes she had gotten herself into, and eventually advice just wasn't enough for her) when I was going through things myself. This led to her asking what was going on, and I told her I didn't want to burden her with the problems, and she needn't ask. after lots of insisting, she told me that she was always there for my problems, as I help her through hers. I believed her. I trusted that she was telling the truth, so I told her what was going on. she didn't offer a lot of advice, which I expected, but we joked, and she cheered me up. I thanked her and told her she helped me a lot - which she did. She reminded me she would always be there to listen to my problems.



I don't talk to a lot of friends about my problems, its usually just because they are personal family issues, or I don't think its worth telling someone I got into a fight with my boss because I didn't stock shelves properly, or something. I don't need to constantly rant about all of my issues. just really, really, big, life long ones, that I don't feel comfortable talking to everyone about.



However, everyone does need to vent sometimes, and I went to her, and she told me she didn't understand what I was saying. I was talking about a field she really isn't into. so I explained the situation, dumbed all the facts down, and tried really really hard to help her understand. I hang out with these people a lot, and they were causing issues within the group - so I needed someone to talk to about it. She started telling me that she just didn't care, that she didn't understand, and she didn't want to understand. it hurt a lot, following the whole 'I'll always be here' for you spiel.



Never the less, I stopped talking to her about my issues. the only thing she ever wants to hear about is boys. so I entertain her, i tell her when i see someone cute walk by, or when I am interested in someone. its not something I talk about a lot, so its a little weird to discuss with her, but I want to remain friends. I still help her with her issues, but when she asks me whats wrong, I always tell her something along the lines of 'my bad, I was just reading &lt;insert site here&gt; online. whats up?' and engage fully in the conversation to make it look like nothing was wrong. I've even opened up my computer to take a picture of a random website for proof. 



I got really, really, stressed out recently at the topic of school. I've always dreamed of going and pursuing further education, but I just can't afford it. I've looked at slowly taking stuff through distance learning, or going into a school and racking up tons of debt, and it just doesn't seem like a very good idea. I didn't want to talk to her about it, but it somehow came up in a conversation with another friend of mine online, and I usually talk to him and make sure hes doing okay when hes going through issues, but it felt so weird having someone who cared equally about what I had to say. I tried to stop the conversation multiple times and he told me that he was fine with it, and he wanted to talk to me about it. he actually cared. and it felt really, really, good. after I stopped talking to him I went to bed and ended up crying for a good while, as I hadn't felt someone genuinely care about me in so long.



My friend recently got into a relationship and shes been in it for 1 month, and she gets upset when I don't comment on every picture she sends to me of her and her boyfriend. I don't mind that shes in a relationship, I have told her many times that I'm happy for her, and the boy (who I've met) seems very, very nice. he isn't telling her he doesn't want her talking to me, we get along every well and hes told her many times hes happy that she has a friend like me to talk to about things that they can't discuss. 



I called her and explained to her that I am delighted that she is happy, but I've told her many times that I think they are a cute couple, and don't always have the time to freak out about how good they look together, and I am the type of person who gets frustrated when people constantly look for confirmation out of me, as I just want to say it a few times and have it over with. 



I don't know what to do, I feel like she doesn't really care about me, but I've known her for what feels like so long and shes one of my only friends in this general vicinity who I hang out with. (most have gone off to school or are internet friends)
I don't need to vent about everything, but talking does help me (as it does everyone), and I would like to have someone to talk to the big things about, and I feel like I can't talk to her about any of that stuff? is she worth keeping as a friend, or should I just stop initiating contact and wait for her to contact me first?

18862,Non-Romantic,3f4z4q,"Hi guys. I haven't posted much on Reddit before, I'm sorry if everything isn't syntactically correct (I'm trying to following the rules as best I can). 

_______________________________________________________________________________
I'm a 20 year old girl with a 17 year old little sister. My mother is full Japanese and my dad is a white American. My mom moved here when she was 10 years old (she's fluent in English), there are no cultural barriers in my parents relationship. I'm in college a few states away (I only return home once every few months) and my sister is going to college (the same one I'm at!) in a month, without my sister it seems like my parents relationship is going to end.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Growing up, I always looked to my parents as superheroes. Nothing could break our family apart. My mom quit her job to raise me (I had lots of health problems all throughout my life and needed lots of attention), and my dad owns a small business nearby our house. My parents are still both very loving towards my sister and I, but have grown to pretty much despise one another. It has gotten to the point where they completely ignore one another, and over the years I've been seeing their true character. 

_______________________________________________________________________________
My mom is a typical Asian mom: very strict, likes to yell/criticize/gossip, but cares deeply for her kids. My dad is much more relaxed, fun, type of guy, and has never yelled/verbally abused my sister and I. 

_______________________________________________________________________________
Their relationship has always been somewhat stressed. To be honest they never had much in common. When I was 15 I was diagnosed with cancer, and I was actually happy because for once I saw my parents embrace and cry together. They talked and listened. Sadly those times have gone, and now my dad stays at his work until 1:00+ am or hangs out at bars until late. My parents sleep in different rooms, and my mom will wait until my dad leaves the house in the morning to exit the room. My mom talks plenty with her sisters about my dad, and I know for a fact she plays the victim card as much as she can. My dad doesn't have many outlets, but he truly abuses his employees (like yell at them, cuss randomly when something goes wrong), it's disgusting. I worked with my dad for a summer and I was constantly apologizing for him. It was so stunning because he never acted like this at home, he was always the fun, loving, dad (and still is when he's with his kids). My parents are both very emotionally and mentally broken.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Their relationship stresses are seriously taking a toll on our entire family. I have been at college for 3 years now, and I am pretty much the only source of comfort for my little sister. She still manages to keep my mom and dad company and we're very worried what will happen when she heads off to college next month. We live in a VERY rural area and my mom recently confessed that one day she wants to move somewhere with more Japanese people. She is very lonely and that really makes me sad. She only has a few friends within (30 miles) that she sees rarely. I REALLY want my mom to get a job/hobby, instead of sit around the house all day. She used to work with my dad, but being around each other in the workplace was REALLY not good for their already strained relationship. For a while she was working as a Japanese translator and loved it, but they rarely call her in because the area we live in is 99.999% white. 

_______________________________________________________________________________
I talked to my dad recently about the situation with mom. He was very vague but confessed that my mom hasn't even kissed him in 7 years. She won't talk to him, interact, etc. Honestly though, I feel like my dad would react the same way. Both of them are stubborn, and won't ever own up to any of their mistakes concerning each other. (My mom will never own up to any mistakes period. While my dad seems to just be much more stubborn around her.) Talking to my mom about anything is like talking to a brick wall, she'll always play the victim card, even with me.

_______________________________________________________________________________
I would love for my parents to get marriage counseling or something. Although, money has always been tight so this might not be an option. I at least want to see them at least attempt to talk to each other and try to improve their relationship. I remember when I was younger I was always scared about my parents getting a divorce (I had heard the term at school and it freaked me out). This was before my parents acted like idiots and they always comforted me that they would never divorce. We were a very happy family. But as of now, if a divorce would put a real smile on their faces then I'm for it. I'm worried for my mom though. She doesn't have many other skills (she has her masters in the social sciences, but who wants to hire a 50 year old Asian lady with a 21 year gap of no experience?) 

_______________________________________________________________________________
I don't even really think that they want to get a divorce. I think that they just want to have a real relationship, and be noticed by one another. Talking with my dad he still said he wants a relationship with my mom. Their pride/stubbornness is making it extremely hard for this to happen obviously. They show no love towards one another, they haven't for years, and everyone is just sad. Looking at my friends or cousins parents just makes me jealous. I just want my family to be happy again.

Marta knocked on my door this afternoon and asked to borrow nail polish remover (I don't own any). Then she handed me a jar of mayonnaise and asked me to smell it. It smelled really strongly of chemicals and it did smell a lot like nail polish remover. She was really upset and asked if I'd played a prank on her.

I said I hadn't and she got even more upset. Apparently there was dried glue on top of the mayonnaise as well and she said she's going to go to the estate agents or the police to complain and try and get fingerprints from the jar. She also asked if my boyfriend who visited over the weekend tried to pull a prank or something by doing it so I called and left a message on facebook. I haven't heard back from him yet but I really, really doubt he'd do that. She said that if it turns out he did then she won't have him in the house anymore - we're long distance and he visits me every two weeks.

My other housemate has gone home for Christmas so I know she couldn't have done it, but I also know that I didn't do it. Marta's really upset and angry with me.

18883,Non-Romantic,2v34ju,"I've been casual friends with this guy for years, but only really got to know him since splitting a two bedroom apartment. Now I can hardly stand to look at him. He's actually a really nice guy, but something about him rubs me the wrong way, like it's all fake. Nearly everyone he's lived with has expressed similar sentiments.

Here's the things about him that just annoy the hell out of me:

* He's a slob. Dirty dishes, junk all over, bad with chores. Enough said there.

* He locks himself out at least once every two weeks, and I have to come back to let him in.

* He's the son of a very wealthy business executive, and his parents are paying for his masters and giving him a monthly allowance higher than my salary

* He's somewhat obsessed with the life of students at elite schools. He comes from an elite private prep school in New York and we both graduated from an elite undergrad institution.

* He's constantly starting these (honestly really dumb) projects that would *never* get a second look if it weren't for his prep school connections and his Dad. It's always *the* project, or *the* book, or *the* startup. (As an example, he founded a company after undergrad which lasted three months before it was dissolved because he and his business partner got in a petty fight. Really, there was no company, there were no good ideas, official documents, intellectual property, proof of concept, or actual interest, and it was just two 22 y/o guys goofing off with their rich parent's money, but he talks about it as if he were in at the ground level of Microsoft).

* He never does any real work ever. I work 60 hour weeks at my job, and he just nearly failed out of his masters program. The only work he does is for his dumb projects (which he is now hitting me up for money for with his latest Kickstarter!), and honestly those are hobbies at best.

* He talks up everyone way too much. Every one of his friends is the most brilliant guy you've ever met, or definitely going to go pro one day.

* The people he talks up the most are his massive slew of female friends who've friendzoned him *so* hard, but he always claims he doesn't want to sleep with them (and then tries anyway).

* He puts on photo shoots with said female friends with a camera that is literally worth more than my entire life savings, and then he hangs the bad pictures around and talks about how good the shots are.

* He's pretentious about *everything.* He's a self-proclaimed master chef, wine expert, scotch expert, etc...

* He gets way too into things and sometimes it's cringe-worthy (e.g. long ago he was cut from the high school football team and so he stayed on as the team photographer, even though there was already a professional photographer. Now he hangs the photos up on our wall).

* He constantly trying to act like he's part of the working class. Like he knows how to use tools, and what manual labor is like, etc... Then I have to redo all his shit handiwork around the house because I'd rather not have the blinds installed backwards. I'm no professional, but I'm not pretending to be, and I can at least do basic housework without tearing holes in the wall.

* He's going into finance.

See objectively he acts very nice, but having gotten to know him, it feels like a big facade to get you to like him and think he's impressive. It all just feels very self-serving, even if in the moment he just seems very innocently annoying.

And, end rant. Felt good to put it all out there in print finally. So reddit, am I just an asshole, or would it take a saint to actually enjoy living with this guy?

Two years ago, my parents split up. My dad had caught my mom cheating on him and told her if he found out again, he would leave. She continued being unfaithful while aware of the consequences. He found out, and while my mom and I were on vacation, he packed all his things and moved out. The divorce was ugly, many hurtful things were said on both sides, and it left my mom pretty devastated. All the while, I was stuck in the middle.


Fast forward to now, my dad is with a lady who I have a great relationship with. My mom, however, is dating a guy, let's call him Jim Bob, who is half her age. He lives about a 6 hour drive from where she does, and makes the trip about every 2 weeks and stays at our house for about 4 or 5 days. I used to like him and have a relatively amicable relationship with him. 


As time has gone on, my mom's closest and oldest friends and I have noticed more and more have self-centered and manipulative he is. He also always expects my mom to cook for him, do his laundry, etc. He slowly has become the center of my mom's life. She has changed from a very independent to co-dependent person. He enables her drinking by being her DD, always. He also continuously refills her drink without being prompted. 


I attend school out of state (not far from where Jim Bob lives) and a couple months ago my mom and brother came out here to visit me for the weekend. I had explicitly told my mom I didn't want Jim Bob there and she promised it would be just us three. Upon her arrival, within 20 minutes of me getting to their hotel, her boyfriend shows up to go to dinner with us. They both knew I didn't want him there and neither of them asked me if it was okay first. I didn't bring it up that night because I didn't want to ruin the entire weekend, but it really bothered me. A few weeks ago, I visited home, and found out Jim Bob had taken all of my stuff I had left in my closet before I went to school, and thrown them on the floor of my room. I recently told my mom I wasn't comfortable with Jim Bob being at our house for Christmas. I thought he should spend it with his own family (who don't live far away from mine) and he can have dinner with us later. She wasn't very happy about this and said things such as it not being fair that I don't accept him when I go and hang out with my dad and stepmom all the time. This is all just to give you an idea of the lack of respect he has for my boundaries and the way my mom plays the victim and takes his side.


So, as I said, her best friends had concerns about their relationship and they constructed an email between the four of them (who have known her for 49 years) voicing them. I had many long conversations with one of her best friends and I was happy to have my feelings towards Jim Bob be validated. I was worried I was the daughter who wasn't ready to see her mom in a new relationship, so I held my tongue for the most part. My mom didn't consider a word they said and basically cut them out of her life. 



And now to the relevant part... Two days ago I was on Facebook and I noticed some very lengthy comments on one of my mom's status. So I read all the comments and it's her telling one of her friends who moved away how she is receiving no support from her friends and her daughter. If they loved me, they would be happy for me. She also brings up the fact that she understands why I would say those things to her, because if I tried to tell my dad the same stuff he would cut me off. In reality, I love my stepmom and I wouldn't be afraid to bring up issues with her to my dad, if I had them. She thinks I'm threatened by Jim Bob. Now remember, this is on her status, not in a private message, where all her Facebook friends can see. I am livid by the time I'm doing reading the comments. That's the type of things I expect a teenager to do, not a grown woman.



I decide at this point that I can't sit back and watch this happen any longer. Nor am I going to live under her roof while she is still with him. I brought this up to my SO, my mom's best friend, and my father (who is also worried about her and wants the best for her) and they all agree that I should say something. I wrote out a long email describing how she's changed from a woman I used to admire to someone who is allowing her boyfriend to manipulate her and alienate her from her loved ones. I'm well aware that this email could ruin our relationship, seeing as she cut off her best friends for doing the same sort of thing. 


I guess what I'm trying to say is, do you think I'm in the right to speak up about what's happening? Or should I respect her decision for who she wants to be with and let her figure it out on her own?

I have a 7mo old daughter. My husband and I (married 5 years) had a stillbirth before we had her. To say the least, we were very nervous during my pregnancy, as was everyone else. My parents pretty much ignored it until I was in my third trimester. They threw a nice shower for us and were really excited to meet their first grandchild (I'm the oldest). However, prior to that, they didn't acknowledge my pregnancy very much. They'd talk to me about how I felt (physically) or when I brought it up, but otherwise it went ignored, not mentioned. I understand. The stillbirth was difficult on everyone, his parents as well. His mother also had a stillbirth so she was my rock during that time.

After I had my daughter, things drastically changed. My parents became very excited and involved. We live on the same street as they do and I make sure to bring her over often and invite them to dinner once a week. 

I know I'm still in that postpartum period, but I don't know if my hormones are just raging or if I'm overreacting. Basically, I think my parents act very bizarre. I feel like my daughter is their light and joy, more than I was and more than my other siblings have been (I have 3). For example, her pictures are all over their house (cell phone background, computer background). Their passwords are her name. I know this because I have to check things for my dad as he just started doing online bill pay. These things I can understand and don't bother me that much, but what does bother me is I feel like they are trying to beat me out. They were very annoyed and/or frustrated when they heard I was exclusively nursing. They wanted desperately to feed her so when I started pumping, they were elated and stopped giving me such a hard time about it. I follow our pediatricians orders and they think everything I do is wrong. Such as no blankets or pillows in the crib because of SIDS risks. 

The reason I'm posting this though is we just started giving her solid food and at first, she refused to eat it. My mom got her to eat some and it was like a freaking victory. She was bragging about how *she* was able to feed her. *Grandma* knows what's best. The other day, someone had said she looked like my mom and I haven't heard the end of it. She rubs it in my face.

My parents seriously try to catch every single milestone before me. I'm a stay at home mom fortunately, but whenever they're over or we'll let them watch her when we go grocery shopping, they're just trying to be there or be the ones that see her do things that I'll miss. Another example of this is the one time I was cutting her nails are accidentally pinched the skin around it. She started screaming (and I felt really bad about this!) and my mom immediately picked her up and said Bad mommy! You're mommy is so bad!

I'm really on my last nerve. Any advice on how I can approach this or do I just ignore it?

18933,Non-Romantic,3e3wuw,"I'll try to keep this short and not drown you with unnecessary backstory. Basically, my sister was and has been a very respectful, responsible, and considerate person her whole life. Until now. I'll give you a list of my sister's behavior in the last month.

* Broke up with her boyfriend of 3 years because he was too controlling by asking her not to stay out all night with no explanation.

* Dropped out of law school (full ride scholarship)

* Began spending all her time with man, let's call him Craig 

* She lives on the other side of the country, almost 3000 miles away. Our family has not seen her since Christmas. She flew home on a day's notice for a surprise visit because she missed us.

* When my brother picked her up from the airport, Craig was with her. They ordered my brother around like he was a chauffeur and went to 3 wineries and a brewery before passing out in his car (this was around 3pm). Also they ask him where to buy weed. He does not smoke. My sister has never smoked until now.

* Brother drives them home (1.5 hour drive) and when they wake up they demand to go back to the city to go to a soccer game that they already bought tickets for. My mother drives because they are still drunk and doesn't want them driving.

* Mom makes plans with them to go out to breakfast in the morning. Sister takes the car without asking before my mom wakes up, and doesn't return until 4:30pm.

* They go out to dinner and Craig and my sister ring up $384 bill (loooooots of drinks. Lots of drinks.) Both have forgotten their wallets and my mom has to pay the bill. 

* Craig/sister try to borrow mom's car and brother's car. They have to work and tell them to get a rental. Sister says they are being rude.

* I live a few hours away from my mom/brother by the Canadian border. Craig and sister drive up and stop by for less than 10 minutes on their way to a Canadian city. 5 of those minutes they smoke weed in my boyfriend's apartment and then ask us to hold their weed while they cross the border. I do not smoke because I am on probation for a marijuana-related offense. I was not friendly toward her about this, and she said I was being a bitch.

* Since they are in Canada, no one can call my sister. My mom e-mails her and tells her she is being extremely careless and irresponsible, as well as inconsiderate. Why is she acting this way? What is going on? Also, since she knows I'm on probation, why would she put me in the awkward position of holding her drugs?

* Her response, verbatim: It was with her boyfriend at her boyfriend's house and [he] smokes all the time. There was a pipe full of weed next to [my name] when I got there. So blame me? Blame everyone she surrounds herself with too. So I did not do anything to get her in trouble. [My name] was a bitch to me and wouldn't even hug me back. I'm tired of always being the bad one when I'm the one who tries to take care of everything. I'm not crazy. I'm not bad. I'm not losing my mind. Why am I judged all the time? I don't want to talk about it again. 

For the record, my boyfriend smokes maybe 4 or 5 times per year. She had never met him before and they definitely did not speak enough to know his habits. There was a pipe on the counter with some ash in it.

My mom forwarded me the email, and I emailed back: My issue was the assumption that I would hold onto your drugs for you when you visited me for less than 10 minutes, implying that I was just a drug deposit box for you and Craig. If I was less than warm and friendly to you, I feel very justified. You have been extremely inconsiderate to your family for this entire “visit,” which was not a visit but a boozy excursion in which you used your family for conveniences. I don’t know what happened to you that you can’t understand how your behavior is upsetting those around you, but you better figure it out, [sister's name].

Anyway, I asked her if she could stop by on the way back from Canada so I could talk to her privately about all that happened. She ignored me. 

WTF is going on and what can we do for her to get the message that she is acting insane??

18936,Non-Romantic,31xzs7,"I started school September 2014 and the only reason I was excited to get there was to get out of my super tiny boring home town. The first quarter started out okay, but eventually my depression got the better of me. I have been taking medication since I was 16 for it, and I still was, but I just started feeling worse and worse. I'd visit my boyfriend on the weekends and it was the only relief I got. It got so bad that I wasn't going to any classes and would sleep almost 24 hours at a time, and I'd either not eat at all or overeat. When I went home for Winter Break I told my aunt how I hated it and she told me I just had to stick it out and get a degree. I visited my doctor at that time and told him how I had been feeling (it hadn't gotten to the worst point yet then) and he told me I would probably do better in a different environment. But since my whole entire family was dead set on my being in college I told myself I'd just try harder next quarter, take classes at different times, take classes I knew I'd like. Didn't help. 

I finally worked up the courage to go to the school's counseling center and tell them what I had been dealing with. The counselor I talked to said the best thing for me would be to go home. I was going to force myself to stay and was prepared for her to tell me the same and that I should just do things differently. It was SO HARD for me to leave college because I knew I'd have to tell my family and they'd be piiiisssseed. But I did it, I left. I asked my grandmother who lived close to the school if I could stay with her for a few months while I looked for a job and then could get out on  my own but my aunt (who has mental problems that have never been dealt with) convinced her to tell me no. There was nowhere else for me to go, really (my other grandparents raised me, and they moved to Arizona as soon as I had graduated). And my aunts in my hometown have there own things to deal with I guess. My boyfriend's mom is SO NICE that she let me stay with her. My boyfriend lives with her too, which yeah is definitely kinda weird, but we are saving up money to move out as soon as we can. I apply to jobs every day (nothing yet T_T) but I by no means sit and do nothing, his mom hates cleaning and dishes so I try to do that stuff and I cook and look after the animals and his sister isn't supposed to be alone due to some recent stuff so while everyone is at work I can be here when she gets home. I'm trying to do everything I can to not be a burden.

But I am so much more happy now, it's like a huge cement casing was broken off of me. I feel so much lighter EXCEPT I am being harassed on all sides from family who says you have to go back to college or you'll regret it forever, you can't stay at your boyfriend's mom's forever (not planning on it!) you're throwing your life away. My aunt told me: if your boyfriend really cared about you he'd tell you to go back to college. I wasn't going to tell my grandparents but they called the school and found out, and then they called the school apparently in my honor to see if I could get my aid again and go back, ho ho ho. I don't think I'm ever going to go back there. If I go to school again I want it to be technical school or trade school. They all say oh does being at your boyfriend's make you less depressed? In a very hurtful way. None of them understand it really, but I don't know why they have to be hurtful about it. My dad is really sick in the same way I am but it was left untreated and now he's blamed for a lot of stuff that would have been better had someone got him help. (Tangent sorry!). 

If I had stayed at school I am certain that I would have seriously injured or killed myself. When my sister's friend committed suicide in high school my grandmother thought my sister was sad about it to get attention and told her suicide was selfish. I think they all see depression as my excuse, and I just didn't like school and I wanted to hang out with my boyfriend more. They think I am still 14. I was really good in high school but college was just not for me. It feels like I had no choice. I know had I said I wanted to do something different they would have still forced me into college. Also they are ballistic over the aid. They for some reason think I had all four years covered. I didn't. I owe the school money now, after two quarters. 

My grandma wants me to call her once a week and tell her my progress. The last thing I want to do is talk to her every week and have her make me feel bad about myself. I'm supposed to be there golden child! I don't wanna be. I really just want to be left alone.

I have no idea how to tell all of them any of this. It would have to be over the phone. I wish I could get them all together. They never let me talk and explaining myself is considered talking back to them. I am an adult now. I am so much more mature than they think I am. College was the worst experience I have ever had. How do I tell them? How do I get them to leave me alone? I know they care, but the way they express it is hurting me. I share the messages and conversations with my boyfriend, and he says wow, how can they be that mean to you? And I see how his family interacts and I think it too. I'm sensitive and always have been and these people are supposed to be the ones I rely on but I can't, not even for a safe place to sleep. 

Sorry this is so long my question is HOW DO I TELL THEM? That I'm fine and I know what I'm doing and college isn't the promised land they think it is for me? To stop berating and hounding me? 
I know I have to deal with it and I want to do it soon.

So I'm not really sure where to start. My parents have been married for close to 30 years. The three of us were fairly close when I was growing up. They were involved in my schoolwork, my sports, and had a big hand in my selection of college when it came to be that time. We also went on plenty of family vacations, played board games, etc, normal parent-child stuff. Overall I think we were a pretty normal 3-unit family.



After high school, I lived on campus for my 4 years at college and my parents were left alone at home for the first time since I'd been born. When I came home on breaks, I noticed their habits had started to settle, but I didn't take much notice of it then. After I graduated, I lived at home for a year, and now have been living on my own for the past year and a half. I live in their rental house on the other side of town, so I see them a couple of times each week.



Now that I see their day-to-day routine now that they've settled into living on their own, it makes me kind of sad. They don't seem particularly unhappy, but they also don't seem excited about much of what they do. The phrase I'd describe them as is content enough. A typical night for them after work is to watch TV for a couple hours, my dad will fall asleep on the couch, my mom will do some work on the computer, and then they go to bed. On the weekends they clean and do the food shopping. My dad plays golf when it's in season, but other than that they're on a pretty strict repetition. They go out to dinner occasionally, but they are pretty much in the house all the time.



They haven't traveled anywhere since the three of us went to Portland over 5 years ago. I've tried encouraging them to take a vacation, but they never seem to look into it for real. We have relatives that travel regularly (and sometimes together), so the opportunity is there, they just never seem to take it. Our family is well off, and my college is paid for, both from my and their contributions, so I don't think it's a financial reason. My mom has actually taken numerous staycations the past couple of years so she doesn't lose the time off. Their marriage seems fine? They don't argue or do anything obviously bad, but I doubt they have as much to say to each other now that I'm not a part of their daily lives.



They tell me that the best night of their week is when I visit, which is sweet, but we really don't do anything exciting. We have dinner, watch some TV, and then I go home. I understand that it's their life and I don't want to push them to change if they don't want to, but it just seems like they never figured out how to go back to real living once I left home. Instead they have settled into a very monotonous routine with the biggest spice being a normal visit from their son. I'd love for them to tell me that the worst night of the week is when I visit, because it was so boring!



Is this just what happens to parents as they get older? Should I encourage them to do more things on their own, or possibly with me? Should I leave them alone because they don't seem to mind their routine? Obviously this is not a stressful situation like a lot of posts on here, but I would appreciate some advice from both sides. Thanks!

I almost wish she wouldn't come now and based on things I am hearing second hand I think she feels the same way, except she's in my bridal party so I have to make things work with her.

The main problem is that she is making everything about her and her baby. She blew off my bachelorette party because she didn't want to leave the baby, even though my brother (her husband) said he would watch her (the baby) all weekend. I really wish she would not bring the baby to the wedding at all so I asked my brother to ask Sally to just have Sally's mom come to the wedding, and stand outside the reception hall with the baby. Sally is acting like that's a ridiculous request but it's my wedding and I don't want the baby crying during the ceremony. I also don't want the baby in the room with us while we get ready, which also pissed Sally off. I don't understand why she can't just have her mom stay with the baby for the day of the wedding and let me have ONE DAY to celebrate my marriage that isn't all about her and her baby.

Sally's mom said if she has to stand outside the wedding she's not even going to come and she will keep the baby at home with her. That sounds fine with me and preferable even, but Sally is having a big problem with this and I'm afraid she is going to back out at the last minute and not even come.

So my paternal grandmother had 6 kids, 4 boys and two girls. 5 of them including my dad live in one neighborhood. My father and uncle are normal, my aunt and other uncle are odd but functional, productive people, and then there's my aunt and uncle in mentioned in the title.

My un-diagnosed aunt, called C from here on, has been living in a house owned by my grandma for most of her life. It's a short walk from my grandma's house and is in a trust so my grandma pays taxes and everything and C gets to live there for her whole life. C used to be a nurse but left because of a bullshit disability claim when she was in her early 30s. Since then she's done literally nothing with her life. I'm amazed she hasn't killed herself at this point. I don't know what she does everyday. Every once in a while she'll pop up to harass family members. She claims no one loves her (true at this point...), that everyone is against her, and that we're generally terrible people who've wronged her. She especially likes to show up during the holidays and for parties.

Recently (two years) my grandma has been developing dementia. She'll repeat stories over and over. The amazing thing though is how happy she's been through it all. That is, until a couple weeks ago when she went to have a mole removed from her neck. I have no idea exactly what the facts are, but my schizophrenic uncle, let's call him B, who lives with my grandma apparently drove her to the dermatologist, hit her while driving the car, then she had the mole removed and a bandaid was put on her neck right where he supposedly hit her.

We've all been confused by this story until we found out C has been calling my grandma every morning, muttering in her ear about B and how he's disturbed and violent.

I should mention that C and B have a long history of being at odds. I have no idea why exactly, but it's mostly C who instigates things. Recently C had a restraining order placed against B, and now he has to go to anger management classes.

So now my grandma is terrified of her son who's lived with her his whole life, and who generally helps out around the house with chores and whatever needs to be done.

Is there anything that can be done here? My grandma is adamant that B has to leave the house. C keeps calling and has basically turned my grandma into a reflection of herself, thinking everyone is against her and no one believes her story.

I should also mention that my grandma and B share the house with my other aunt (odd but sane) who works 12 hour days.

We are both very social and have many friends from several walks of life but this is a first for us.

Through a series of happenstance (nothing sexual and/or inappropriate) my husband and I have befriended a male stripper and prostitute. 

He is a very sweet and super cool dude who has proved to be a loyal and good friend, particularly to my husband, and has many great qualities about him.

He likes to keep what he does under wraps so he tells most people he meets, when they ask what he does, that he is a masseur. My husband and I know what Riley (our friend) does as opposed to what he tells people is not really our business and both of us understand why he wouldn't just blurt out his profession to anyone.

Here's where it gets tricky. My husband and I have talked about introducing Riley to all of our friends. Riley is bisexual (very in the middle of the fence) and single and is both very charming and easy on the eyes. We know both our single male and female friends will take an interest in him sexually and romantically.

Our question is, should we tell our friends what Riley does for a living if/when they ask us? Obviously with strangers its not our secret to tell, but these people are also good friends of ours. We don't want to hurt or betray Riley but neither do we want to do that to our other friends.

We, of course, can't be certain about our friends stance but the general vibe we get is that being a sex worker would be a deal breaker. My husband and I do not think strippers and prostitutes are lesser human beings, unworthy or undeserving of love and happiness or anything like that. But neither of us would want to have any kind of sexual or romantic relationship with a stripper or prostitute and we would be angry with our friends if they knew and never said anything, especially because we are pretty sure Riley won't say what he really does for a living.

We don't know if Riley has an STD or how often he gets checked for them and we aren't going to ask, but obviously his profession could pose a health risk to our friends if they decide to sleep with Riley.

My husband and I both want what's best for Riley and our other friends and we are very torn on what is appropriate here. Is it our job to stay completely out of it or should we give our friends a heads up? Either way we feel like we'd be betraying or hurting someone. Or should we just avoid introducing Riley to our other friends like we have so far and avoid this dilemma altogether?

Background: My mom [44 F] has always had a complicated relationship with her older sister [49 F]. For their entire life, my aunt has been mean and emotionally abusive to my mom. My aunt would literally beat up my mom and their other siblings (during childhood) as well as being manipulative and bitter. She's bitter because as a teenager she was out of control, doing a lot of drugs, and having 3 children out of wedlock. Her first child was born when she was 17 and my mom (12 at the time) ended up raising him for the first several years. Even in the rest of my aunt's life, she has not made good choices. She's been divorced, remarried, is morbidly obese, in tons of debt, and lives in a trailer now. None of that would matter though, if she was a good person. But she's not. My mom, on the other hand, got married right after high school, had two kids, and has lead a quiet but successful life. We live in a nice house and have nice things. We are not rich but my parents work hard and have reaped the rewards. My aunt is constantly throwing this back in my mom's face and saying things like, You have a nice house and nice cars and I have nothing. Why don't I get anything? Like that's my MOM's fault?!

Me [22 F] and my aunt: Most of my memories of my aunt while growing up are not good memories. During the times when she was actually still talking to my mom, I used to hang out with her kids (my cousins) over at their house a lot. My aunt would constantly be trying to single me out, punish me, make me feel bad, embarrass me in public, etc. I remember a specific time she made up something that she said I did and tried to get me in trouble with my mom but thankfully my mom didn't believe her/didn't think it would have been a big deal anyway so I wasn't punished. I've separated myself a lot from my aunt now that my cousins are grown and gone (I still have great relationships with all of them). But about 1 to 1 1/2 years ago, my aunt and I had a confrontation on facebook over private messages. I finally flat out asked her why she was always picking on me, what her problem was with me. Her only response was to say that she lost respect for me in the past few years. I was confused because the only thing I'd really done in the past few years was go to college and become the first person in my family to graduate with a bachelor's degree. I asked her to explain and instead of doing that she just started laughing (haha haha haha, etc) until I said, okay fine, we're done here. She blocked me on facebook (and my mom over something else around the same time) and we didn't talk again until 2 months ago.

Current dilemma: 2 months ago, my grandmother's cancer (that we had known about for awhile) finally took over. She was bedridden for about a month as she deteriorated and eventually passed a month ago. This is the only reason I've been in contact with my aunt (it was her and my mom's mother). My aunt made up with my mom with tears and apologies, although no explanations, after not talking to her for over a year. However, no apology was given to me. I have been civil and nice but haven't gone out of my way to talk to her. It would have been rude to ignore her or avoid her during this time. But now, everything is done. I don't buy her sudden change of heart about her attitude towards my mom or me. She complained to my mom that I am holding a grudge against her and my mom has been begging me to just get over it. I explained to her today that I am angry at my aunt, I am holding a grudge and it was because of her past behavior. I told her that I would stop being angry if I received an apology but that regardless, I do not want to be friends with my aunt. I don't think I should have to just because we are related. I don't want to invite her into events in my life anymore and while I would still attend family events at neutral locations, I would not want to attend any in my aunt's home. This is apparently an issue because my aunt is hosting Easter. My parents and I are going to my Dad's side at first but my mom wants us to also go to my aunt's house afterwards. I told her that I won't and that I can drive myself to my Dad's family celebration or just not go anywhere. I feel like these kind of things are going to keep happening and that my mom is going to keep pressuring me to hang out with my aunt and her together or to go over to my aunt's house. I just don't want to and I don't understand how to explain further to my mom how uncomfortable and unsafe I feel around my aunt. I suffer from anxiety as well so things that she does like singling me out in front of others, trying to embarrass me in public, would really exacerbate that. How should I approach this issue in the future?

19068,Non-Romantic,22m3h0,"I apologize for the length and the rambliness! 

Currently, I'm living with my roommate of two years (who we will call Julia) on campus. She's a great friend and roommate and I love living with her. We have a third friend, (who we'll call Katie). All three of us have signed a lease for an apartment next year and have paid the first month's rent together.

Julia and I knew of Katie last year when she lived on our hall. I always got a weird vibe around Katie and she made the two of us a little uncomfortable. However, Julia and Katie realized they were from the same town and became friends. I still got a weird feeling about her but became friends with her as well. It soon came out that Katie had OCD, which we figured was no big deal because she seemed to be handling it. Katie would often bring it up as a reason for her actions. Julia and I were very patient with her and offered her an ear to listen to (Julia more often than me!). I had some issues with Katie respecting my boundaries and giving me space throughout the year, so I began to distance myself a bit.

Over the summer, Katie had a breakdown where she told her parents she might have AIDS, which was one of the things she'd obsess about. Her parents grounded her and Katie ended up trying to skype and call me almost every day. She even came over to Julia's house uninvited. When I answered her calls, she'd try to keep me on the phone for hours and cry. Spending time with Katie becomes more of a therapy session than anything else. Julia and I begin to feel very drained and start to avoid spending time with her. When Katie complains about something that is entirely her fault, I start to call her out on it and give her advice rather than say what she wants to hear. This causes some issues between her and I.

Fast forward to this year, Katie becomes extremely clingy and dependent. She brings up things I have told her inappropriately to other people and I get the feeling that she's trying to compete with me for Julia. She comes to our dorm room unannounced a few times which made us uncomfortable. Juila and I sat her down and told her that we would not live with her next year unless she got help for her OCD. We have had several talks with her about this and I have even offered to take her to the counselors on campus. Katie will say she is going to and act fine for a week or two, but will immediately go back to her usual ways. We know she had a therapist for a long time growing up, but she refuses to get help now. 

Julia and I have come to the realization that Katie is manipulative and selfish. She has an extreme victim complex and uses our guilt to get her way. Katie will throw tantrums where she'll make sure everyone sees her run away and cry and will keep it up until someone comes after her and does what she wants. Julia and I aren't even sure if she realizes that she's being manipulative. 

As this year has progressed, Katie has gotten much worse. She twists things Julia and I say around so that we seem like the bad guys. Our mutual friends are annoyed with her but still feel bad. It's gotten to the point where I have asked her to leave me alone and not talk to me unless it's about the apartment, and Julia is feeling similarly. We are considering asking Katie to leave and find a new place to stay for next year. The only problem is that it's hard to find a new roommate at this time of the year, and we do feel bad for kicking out Katie so late in the year (our apartments push us to sign very early, so we signed during a time she was doing better). We were hoping she'd get help and get back on track, but now we've realized that her OCD is often an excuse for her to get her way and be a shitty person. Cutting her out will also harm the relationships we have with mutual friends who still pity her.

I know living together will be an awkward, uncomfortable time, but I can't help but feel like a jerk for doing this to her. Katie still thinks that I'll be friends with her again, so this is going to crush her. Should Julia and I just suck it up for a year and be the bigger people, or would it be better for us to move on and try to find a healthier living situation?

**tl;dr**: Ex-friend is living with me next year, don't know if I should suck it up or ask her find somewhere else to live.

EDIT: Julia and I have talked about it more and have spoken to our parents. We are going to talk to Katie tonight and request that she live elsewhere. Normally I'd say we should let her have the apartment, but it's easier for us to find a single roommate and easier for her to find a group that needs an extra.

19075,Non-Romantic,2avd4p,"I'm not sure where to start, there are a lot of details to this crazy story, but I will try to get as much as I can across. My parents are divorced and they do not speak to each other. As part of their divorce settlement, my dad is required to pay 55% of my college expenses, my mother 35%, and myself 5%. Obviously this deal worked out pretty great for me. I chose to go to an in-state school, so my personal expenses are so low that I can work and afford to take care of my own contribution without taking out loans. I am debt free. My parents are pretty well off (at least, my dad is and my mom has been since she remarried) but they like to pretend like every dime I cost them is putting them in the poorhouse every month (both of their incomes separately are probably something like six figures. Like I said, my mom makes hardly any money but her husband makes at least as much as my dad). If it weren't for the divorce, I would have just bit the bullet and supported myself because dealing with money with the two of them is absolutely impossible and compounded by the fact that they require me to be the gobetween for them as they refuse to speak to each other, even in emails. My dad has taken out his own loans, but my mom took out the student loans that were offered to me in my name and told me she will pay them back.

ANYWAY (phew!), I'm a music education major currently. My first two years of school were focused almost entirely on the music aspect, as that's the way the degree is set up. I love music, so this was awesome for me and I really enjoyed school. But this past year, I finally started getting into my education classes and realizing that I cannot nor will I ever teach in public school. It causes me a colossal amount of stress and I just do not have the personality to teach in a normal school and I don't think I should subject children to that.. As part of my degree requirement, I am supposed to go do a student teaching project for my final semester, which is essentially an unpaid internship with a school. I am supposed to go live with my parents while I do this as I would be working full time at the school and have absolutely no way to support myself.

I recently found out that it's possible to get my degree without getting a public school certification. Part of doing this would mean I could forgo my student teaching and instead do something like 9 extra credit hours in advanced music courses. I wouldn't be able to teach in a public school, but as I said I already do not plan on teaching anyways. Currently my plan is to go and get my masters in music performance overseas immediately when I finish my bachelors. It's not in my plan at all to teach so I feel like I can do a lot better for myself in preparation if I stay at school and get better prepared for my masters degree. I also felt just so much pressure that has been bothering me for a year lift when I made this decision.

I'm really afraid to tell my parents. I feel like my parents see me as an extension of themselves and their accomplishments rather than as their child. I don't think they will care that I don't want to teach, but that they will just be upset that I won't be living at home next spring and they won't be saving any money. I'm also worried that they will feel like the money they spent for me to go to school has been totally wasted (I don't.. I really feel like my degree has prepared me for what I want to do next. I'm not totally changing fields). My parents and I are not close really, but I am close with the rest of my extended family and my sister, so I am scared that they will not want to speak to me and this will cut me off from the family. I'm also worried that because my mom took out my student loans for me, she will suddenly decide she doesn't have to pay them back and there is no legal recourse I can take to make her pay because the bills are in my name. Having to pay those loans back would really affect my ability to get my master's right away and move abroad.

How do I even begin to approach this situation with them? I have always done what they thought was best and have never stood up to them before. My mom and dad always say they want me to be independent and make decisions, but this usually only applies if I'm doing what they expect me to do, as demonstrated by the way they've treated some of my past boyfriends (aka terribly). Any advice or perspective is greatly appreciated.

19079,Non-Romantic,22ex7t,"So, the title pretty much says it. Me and my (former?) best friend Annie were in a group together with two other girls (Jayden and Erica). I knew J way before we started hanging out with the other two, but she was always a bit hot/cold to me. Long story short we start hanging out with the four of us, things are going great. All of the sudden, I'm being excluded from the group, without being informed by anyone. (This is not the issue here, it's their loss, I'm over that).  

But since we started meeting as a group, I've become best friends with Annie. So when I asked her what's up with the excluding, she said she didn't know what I was talking about, that she didn't know, that it wasn't her a fault because she wasn't the hostess at those evenings, and in the end: 'I don't want to stand in between the two of you.' So obviously, sth has happened, the other two are being all high-schooly about it, and she feels she has no other choice but lying to me, because she doesn't want to lose either of us.   

Over the next few weeks they continue to meet each other, without me, and Annie and I meet separately. But things are off and awkward, I feel like I can't tell her things, she's always on her phone and becoming more and more distant, still acting like nothing has happened.   

So here's the thing: I don't know how to be friends with someone who is holding things from me, and has agreed with other people to exclude me from a group. I really understood where she was coming from, not wanting to choose, but it's driving us apart. And I think the whole thing is just so damn childish and immature, I don't know if I even want to be friends with her anymore.

19093,Non-Romantic,2b1tfx,"I started working at a local fast food joint in early April - so far I actually really enjoy it and the people I work with. Our staff is extremely small (we're very short-handed right now) so even the teenagers are working near full-time (I've worked overtime the past two weeks). Because of this, everyone's pretty stressed out and exhausted, myself obviously included.

So on Sunday, I opened the restaurant - came in at 8:30 and was supposed to work until 4:30. Not bad. But then, a girl that I work with, Brittany, ended up feeling under the weather and I was consequently asked to cover her shift for her (5 until close - 10 PM.) I was the ONLY person on the schedule that could have possibly covered the shift - there was only one other person in the entire staff that wasn't working that night, and they happened to be out of town. I actually had plans that night to go to a town festival with friends - the festival only comes around once a year and this was the last night it was going to be on for. I unfortunately couldn't attend the previous two days because I was, of course, working. But I apprehensively agreed to covering the shift anyways, despite blowing off my plans, despite having to now work a 13 hour shift, as Brittany offered to take my shift this Friday night. It would be the first Friday night I've had off since... Well, pretty much since I started working. I was pretty stoked about it.

The night ended up being EXTREMELY brutal. We were absolutely slammed from start to finish, and it seemed like everything was going wrong. After my shift ended, I went into the bathroom and broke down crying. Continued crying for most of the night.

Anyway, the next time Brittany and I work together (Tuesday), I ask if she's still covering my shift on Friday. Her response? Oh... I have plans.

I was LIVID. Did it not occur to her that I might've had plans on Sunday night, but blew them off just to help her out? I couldn't contain my anger. Everyone knew something was wrong. My manager pulls me aside to privately ask what's wrong, I explain briefly. There wasn't much he could do - It's not like the switched shift was placed on the schedule or anything, it wasn't a formal agreement. It was kind of just a, you did me a solid so I'll do you one sort of thing.

Now, my manager is a cool guy, I've known him my entire life and he's like a brother figure to me. But one thing he lacks in terms of professionalism is confrontation. When it comes to handling drama, he has a way of stirring the pot even further - sometimes intentionally. I should've considered this before telling him about Brittany.

So back to Tuesday, just after venting to my manager. My first shift ends, and my second one doesn't start for about an hour and a half, so I decide to chill at home for the meantime. Brittany's shift ends half an hour before my second shift starts, so I wouldn't see her at all anymore that night. I was more than half-way surprised when she texts me just before her shift ends saying, If you have a problem with me, talk to me about it, NOT the manager. Apparently he bitched her out pretty hard after I left.

I texted her back explaining that I did feel bad for acting passive aggressive, because I really do. I probably should've at least confronted her about it at work, but I didn't at all feel bad about taking it to the manager. I wanted him to offer a solution to the problem, that was my intention. It was a work related issue; I do not feel I'm in the wrong for letting an authority figure handle it. She never texted me back.

It should be noted that the majority of people at work hate Brittany - partly because she pulls this kind of stuff with other people, and party because she's just... mean. There's really no other way to describe it. I've witnessed her say the most downright rude and disrespectful things to coworkers, especially the newer ones - I myself had been on the receiving end of her rudeness particularly when I first started. She's the token 'bully' of the workplace, basically. The problem is that she actually has a good work ethic and is a productive person who does her job well, so the higher-ups couldn't care less (except for the assistant manager I previously mentioned - he hates her even more than I do and if he had any say in the situation, she'd be fired ASAP).

I haven't seen nor talked to Brittany since Tuesday, but there's a staff meeting tomorrow morning and it's kind of a big deal - apparently there hasn't been one in 4 years, so we're both obviously going to be there. I'm almost positive that at some point she's going to bring the incident up in front of everyone - that's just the kind of person she is. She puts people on blast without remorse because she likes to watch them squirm. That's one reason I'm nervous about the meeting. But another is that I'm almost certain they're going to promote Brittany to being a shift leader of some sort. She actually gave the owner of the restaurant an ultimatum once and basically said if he doesn't give her some level of authority, she'll quit. His response was that there are many opportunities for her. This, obviously, is the worst case scenario for me. 

Here's another problem: Brittany told me last week that she's been dating one of the assistant managers for a year now. (He's 23, she's 17. She told me this because she actually really liked me up until Tuesday). I promised I'd keep it a secret and I intend to, because for as much as I dislike Brittany, her boyfriend is actually a really good guy and I'd hate to see him get in trouble or reprimanded. I don't know if keeping the secret is actually a good idea or not - I've never been put in this situation. Though I do feel kind of... defeated at the thought that the two of them could have authority over me - he's dating her, so no matter what happens, he'll take her side. She'll give me a hard time whenever possible. It just seems like a losing battle. I guess I just need advice on moving forward at this job and what I can do to get past this drama with Brittany - especially at the meeting tomorrow. What do I even do if she brings up the incident, what should I say? Should I take her secret to the grave, or what? Like I said before, I've never been in a situation like this. I can't even remember the last time I've had 'drama' with anyone. I need advice on handling it in a professional manner.

19096,Non-Romantic,2pc3gd,"My fiancee and I had been thinking about getting a cat for over a year. Three days ago, we fell in love with a cat at the local SPCA. We brought him home with all the things he needed and were very excited to own our first pet together.

Today, my parents took us out to lunch and we let them know that we got a cat. They both seemed fine with it at the time but later my dad sent this email:

 I’m sorry, but here is a heavy letter. I was devastated today when you told me that you had a cat. I know that you weren’t thinking of all of the ramifications. I just want you to give you some idea of the consequences of having it.

I’m extremely allergic to cats and because I have asthma the allergic reaction turns into an asthma attack. These attacks are dangerous. After I've been in a house where a cat lives I have lingering symptoms for days afterwards. If I was locked in a house with a cat I would die. Your brother is also allergic to cats.

I know that what the future holds is hard to imagine. But, I cannot attend anything at your home while you have a cat. Cats live 15 years on average. He will live until you are about 38 years old. By then you will probably have a tween or 2. I will be 66 yrs old when his 9 lives are up. You and your brother and your future families are what I look forward to most as I spiral into old age. I really look forward to being involved in your lives and to being able to help you with things like home repairs, yard-work and childcare. This is what parents live for! 

One of the primary reasons why we moved back is for you and your fiancee; and we predict your brother will end up here too.  It truly devastates me that if you have a cat I won’t be able to be as close to you as we could be. I don’t normally share my feelings and I definitely don’t want to meddle in your lives, but I feel like this is my one chance to let you know what keeping this cat will mean for our future. I want to be able to come to your house when you host Thanksgiving or Christmas, (believe it or not that will happen), or even just a bbq. I want to be able to come to your children’s birthday parties. I want to be able to help you maintain your house and yard. I want to be able to take care of your children in their own house. These are the things that I am looking forward to.

I know that you have had the cat for a couple of days and that you care about him, but I would really appreciate it if you would both consider returning him so that I can be a part of your lives. The longer you keep a pet, the harder they are to part with. If you choose to return him and need help,(because of your Orlando trip) your mother has volunteered to return him for you and I will reimburse you for all the money that you have spent on him. 

Up until today, I had no idea that he was allergic to cats. He says that antihistamines don't work and that he doesn't want to do the rounds of allergy shots because they would take too long. My parents have warned me about not getting a cat before when we brought up the possibility to them over the last year but they did so in a way where it sounded like life advice warning us about the responsibility of raising a pet. 

My fiancee is obviously very upset.  The cat we adopted has already been returned once by another person.  We don't want to have to put him through that again and give him back a second time needlessly.  Is there any way that we can all get along?

After some research we found that if he plans ahead he can take rounds of medication to stop the allergy from starting.  My fiancee wants to keep the guest room bedroom closed so the cat cant go in so its free of dander and have an air filter in there for when he comes to visit. We're willing to do anything to keep the whole family together, including sending the cat to a friend's or to a kennel for his extended visits. We will deep clean before he arrives and place air filters around the house to limit dander. 

He doesn't think that these measures will help, and that the cat being in the house will make it completely inhospitable to him. Basically it's him or the cat.  

Other questions we don't have answers to are: Since he lives in the same town, how often will he need to spend the night?  Why does he need to worry about the cat for yard work if its an indoor cat? Why with proper preparation would we need to give up our pet?  Why didn't he make it clear to us when we first announced our interest in getting a cat just how allergic to them he was?

Is he justified in his request or needlessly dramatic?

TLDR: I didn't know it but my dad is extremely allergic to cats.  He sent a dramatic email asking us to give up our cat for adoption so he can do yard work and spend time with our future kids. Is that necessary? Or is there a middle ground?



**EDIT: Update!**



Thank you all so much for your comments and advice! I thought it was pretty funny just how many of you thought I was a girl. I guess my title is a little confusing. I also thought it was very interesting how divided the comments were between keep the cat, your dad is crazy and ditch the cat, it's your dad!. Definitely a tough situation. My fiancee and I spent the entire night discussing our options. We brainstormed well past sunrise, and finally came up with a plan that we feel everyone can live with.

Firstly, we know that our relationship with my father is more important than our new cat. We knew that from the get go, but wanted to try our hardest to find a middle ground if there was any. That started with thinking of ways we could clean up our future house whenever my dad came to visit. It quickly became clear that such methods are spotty at best and would still leave my dad pretty miserable from his symptoms.

So, it seemed we'd need to give our new cat away. My fiancee was very upset but understood that it was very important to our relationship with my dad, so she got on board (this is why I'm marrying her folks!). 

Then, upon more discussion, we had a realization; my dad never comes up to our apartment. There's nothing to do here, no reason for him to be here. We only ever visit them or go out somewhere. And for the next four years, I will be in dental school and living in apartments. So the final plan took form.

**Our cat will live with us for at least the next four years while my fiancee and I live in apartments and I complete dental school. My fiancee and I have no plans to have children anytime soon, so no missed time for my dad. My dad's allergies are fine as long as he's not in the same house as the cat; we will keep a fresh change of clothes ready for hanging out with him just in case. Things will just continue as they always have, and he never even needs to see the cat.**

**So what will become of the cat when those four years are up? Well that's where the real heroes of the story come in. My fiancee's grandparents, avid animal lovers, are happy and willing to take our cat when we're ready to start our (human) family. The cat will live relatively close by so that he will always be a part of our lives, but never a part of my dad's. It will be difficult to part ways with him, of course, but we will know that he is going to a loving family that we can always visit and preserving our relationship with my father is absolutely worth it.**

I truly think this is the most elegant solution to this thorny problem. I've talked to my mom and she is on board, albeit with some concerns about our ability to really give the cat up when the time comes. We're going to talk to my dad later tonight when he gets home from work, and I think he'll share my mom's concerns, but I think this idea will grow on him. 

I asked my mom why they didn't tell us how bad his cat allergy was when we first discussed getting a cat.  She didn't give us any good reason other than some remember when scenarios that never happened.  e.g. She swears that they once tried to come over to my fiancee's parents house and couldn't come inside because they have a cat... my fiancee's parents don't and have never had a cat so obviously my mom is confused.  

My only concern is that my father, who doesn't normally express himself, will be offended that we didn't simply take the cat back to the SPCA when he opened up. I hope that he doesn't resent us for finding a middle ground which I feel to be very reasonable. Even if he does not take the news of this plan very well I will carry it out; we made a commitment to this cat and we are not going to send him back to the shelter under any circumstances. He either stays with us or goes to another loving home. I think that this will be the perfect long term solution.

So thanks again reddit!

Okay, so I met this girl back when we were fifteen and she straight up told me she thought I was crazy because I was independent and very assertive. I didn't really like her presence at first, but I grew and found it quite nice. I'm a very quiet person too, and she was loud so it was annoying at first but that's not the point. 

Back in 2012, she started dating this guy named -- well, I'll call him 'Justin'. They started dating, and I was like Hm, this is alright because I wasn't really wanting a boyfriend and she kept trying to tell me we should get you a boyfriend. But, I didn't want a boyfriend.

Eventually, all of our phone calls became about Justin, and it would just drive me crazy. So, I decided that I needed some distance, and focused on other stuff.

Back in the end of June, they broke up. I felt sympathetic when she told me, and asked me to hang out with her. We did a call and she spent the entire time talking about Justin, and just all this stuff. We ended up hanging out at a McDonalds, one that she went to with Justin. She chose the same booth that she had memories with Justin in, and I had no comment about it. After all, I was too focused on my food and just kind of let her rant about things. This was on last Monday.

Back on Friday, I was at work -- I work for the LCBO -- and my phone just starts ringing. I can't pick it up, because I have a lazy coworker and a bitchy supervisor. It was my friend, who I told her I was working a shift from five to ten earlier that day.  She didn't understand, and tried calling again. I texted her when I had a second saying that I was at work.

The next day, I work the late shift again, and she calls five times, and sends eight texts within a six and a half hour shift. All about Justin being in the hospital. I sent her back a 'okay, I get he's your ex and your best friend, but I'm busy. I'll talk to her when I get home'. She instead got really bitchy and told me I was being unsympathetic towards her and Justin, and that I need to be more kind. 

Now, some may paint me as unsympathetic, but trust me -- I'm trying. But when I'm being annoyed at work when I already have a lot of responsibility put on me. I don't need her being snarky. I have tried to be sympathetic towards her situation, that she still loves him, but she won't leave me alone, and I do like my space. I think she's being over-reactive and by telling me that I'm not being sympathetic to her situation, is making me just ... regret even asking if she was okay after her break up.

19133,Non-Romantic,2skyjo,"Before I begin, I'd like to establish that I've heard all of this secondhand which is why some of it is unclear.

Background: My parents are divorced. My dad is remarried, my mom is re-engaged. My sister and I lived with my mom until a few months ago, shortly before a move, when she and my mom got into a fight and she moved to Dad's, essentially on an impulse, but Mom and I suspect it is due in significant part to the fact that they are less likely to impose (reasonable, in my opinion) rules on her. Since moving in with Dad she's taken on a job as a cashier at a grocery store.

Extra backgroundy background: Her boyfriend [18M] of about a year is a cool guy in my and most others' opinion, but like most boyfriends she's had, she's getting bored of him and at this point is essentially stringing the poor guy along.

Now the problem. This coworker of hers (Beth, let's say) is a 35 year old woman who is living in a two-bedroom apartment with a 36 year old man (Paul, let's say). Beth is actually married (though she may be divorced?) with kids, but her husband and said kids live in a town about an hour away, and I'm not completely sure why Beth is living and working out here.

A few weeks ago Sis didn't come home at night until about 1 AM. Dad was understandably upset and talked to her about it. She'd apparently spent the night at Beth's, since Beth lived very close to the store where they both work and she is sometimes scheduled to work late. Dad and Stepmom put their foot down a bit since it's not really cool for her to just not be home until past midnight without any sort of contact.

The other night, Sis reveals to Dad and Stepmom that she wants to move in with Beth and Paul. Dad and Stepmom are understandably a bit stunned and, last night, have a sit-down with her. They discuss why on Earth it might be that she would want to move in with this woman. Sis talks about wanting to be an adult / independent or some other nonsense. Dad and Stepmom ask her if she's having feelings for this woman, which she does not answer. Dad and Stepmom being who they are, they go on this little homophobic guilt-trippy thing along the lines of Don't you want to get married and have kids? (gay marriage is legal in this state, I have no idea what's up with those two).

So we're clear, Mom and I couldn't care less whether she's gay or not. She's potentially entering into a relationship with a married (?) 35-year-old who already has kids. That's fucked up regardless of the sexes of the people involved. I say might here because it's not entirely clear to me whether Beth is aware that this relationship is forming.

In particular, one notable excerpt from the recount of the conversation I heard was when Dad and Stepmom asked if they could come over to the apartment and meet Beth and Paul. Sis said that *she'd have to think about it* (!!). Further, apparently Beth and Paul once asked Sis how much money she had, which she answered truthfully (??). Regarding sleeping arrangements, when asked, Sis said she'd be sleeping on a second bed in Beth's room (which has yet to be purchased) but not before almost saying with Beth.

Sis has yet to break up with the poor boyfriend she's been stringing along. Having been in a similar situation in her boyfriend's position earlier this year, I'm not very happy about that bit, either.

I texted Sis a bit today and tried to figure out her reasoning in all this. She insists that she wants to try being an adult, and that she'll never learn if she doesn't have a chance to fail. I pointed out the flaws in this line of thinking, but she refuses to change her mind. She also believes that she will be happier living with Beth than she would living with either Mom or Dad.

Mom called Sis earlier today and lost her temper a bit. Shortly after she called Sis again to explain that she wasn't angry at Sis so much as at Beth and Paul. She asked Sis to come over for dinner, and she did. Dinner's cooking now and I'll be attending when it's ready, along with Mom and Sis.

We know each other well enough that we have each other's Skypes, know each other's names, all of that.

Enter my mother. I love her, and she loves me, but for most of my life she's emotionally abused me. Partially because of her and partially because of my own faults, I developed a pretty deep depression when I was an adolescent, and it's stayed with me through now. It's not like a constant thing, 99% of the time she's kind and caring. But 1% of the time...she terrifies me.

But that's not what I'm asking advice for. So today, I got my chores done pretty quickly, and decided that I had enough time for a round or two of TF2. I logged in, set up a Skype call with my friends, and began playing. I hadn't played in about a week and a half, and they were happy to hear from me. We were chatting, laughing about something stupid, and suddenly my mother came into my room. I keep my door open so she can see what I'm up to, and she saw me gaming and got angry that I wasn't cleaning.

Before I could hang up the call or get off of the game, she had already begun berating me. I couldn't turn away to turn it off because she would only get angrier. I sat there in silence while she yelled at me, painfully aware that my friends could hear all of it. She finished and left my room, and I just shut down the computer without saying anything. I had no idea what even to say.

None of them signed up for this, they really don't know me well on a personal level anyway. And suddenly they get collectively thrown into the deep end. I think what I should do is write them a message telling them that I'm okay but that I can't play anymore, and just delete the game and their Skypes.

* After months and months of bringing them down and blowing up their phones they told me they didn't want to talk to me anymore sometime in October.
* Since then I've gotten healthy again through surgery and seeing a pysch.
* I tried 2 times since October to reach back out to them, and was successful the first time in Dec. and got them to hang out with me. That lasted 1 day as I apparently violated the going slow agreement by asking to hangout again sometime and in turn got angry.
* Since the first weeks of Dec. I've seen then once at a mutual friends funeral. 
* A couple weeks ago I did decide to reach out to them again, as I truly feel I'm in a better (not perfect) place. They responded decently, but seemed very cautious. 
* Last weekend another member of our old group reached out to them to hangout and they said sure, invite 9Virtues too.
* I was very reluctant to accept after what happened in Dec. also throwing into the mix that this other member of the group had also been on the outs with them for as just as long as I had.
* So I went and from the moment I first saw them I was a little iffy about the whole thing. The guy was very recepetive, but the girl was still different. For example we were waiting for them to walk up to a balcony we were on. The guy was laughing and waving at us. The girl looked like she was doing everything in her power to not even look up at us.
* As the night went on the guy was 100% normal and how I remembered him. Her on the other hand I saw glimpses of a friend I knew.

Also I feel like I'm walking on egg shells. After suggesting to hangout again back in Dec. got me thrown to the do not call list, I'm worried about every single thing I say.


For example, last night I was hanging out with another mutual friend and his birthday is coming up. Last year for it we all 4 went camping. He told me ask them if they would do that again. I sent that text and I never got a response despite them reading it (iphone read thing).


Idk what to do with that now. Idk if they are mad at me for suggesting such an event and that was a final straw, or if they were busy and forgot, or what......  I want to contact them and ask, but I'm afraid that will only make things worse. The old me would have already been blowing up their phones demanding an answer as soon as I saw that read note.

Kaley and I have been friends since our freshman year of high school. She has always been more of the rebel while I was perfectly content not disobeying my parents or making them worry sick about where I've been. Kaley is very reckless in regards of other feelings. She is a very selfish individual when it comes to some things. However, she can also be the sweetest, funniest, most supportive person I have ever met. Whenever I call to complain about something, she is always there for me. She is always there to listen and to give me advice. The advice is usually never that great but I appreciate that she tries. 

Kaley and I have had our problems and fights like friends usually have, but we always find our way back to each other. However, recently she made a comment that I just cannot seem to get over.

I met my friend, Charlotte through the boy I was seeing at the time. Charlotte is the best person I have ever met. She does not judge people. She is down to Earth. She has helped me out in the last few months that no one knows about. I felt comfortable enough telling her about my past abuse from a family member that no one knows about. My point is, Charlotte is an amazing person whom I trust with all my heart. Charlotte is a lesbian. Which I feel silly even putting that detail because when describing her, it shouldn't be a detail to be told because Charlotte is so much more than her sexual orientation, but it matters for the sake of the problem I have with Kaley.

So I recently ended things with the guy that Charlotte is friends with. It was bad. I was a wreck. I immediately text Kaley and Charlotte because they are my support system. Charlotte ended up coming over, drinking with me, and being the most awesome friend I have ever had. Kaley mentioned coming over, but never did.

I went to work later in the week, and Kaley's sister asked me about the night that Kaley was suppose to come over which I thought was weird. She told me that Kaley told her mom, Yeah, I am thinking about having Maddie (me) and Charlotte over since Maddie is going through something pretty bad right now. But I am not sure I want Charlotte over because well, she's gay... 

I instantly got pissed off. I was so more upset for Charlotte because here's this girl who she does not even know, and she's completely judging her off something that should not even matter. I went off to Kaley's sister. I told her how mad I was and upset. Kaley's sister tried to calm me down by saying Oh I think she only said it because my mom was right there and you know how my mom is. I do not think she actually cares that Charlotte is gay To me, that's even worst. The fact that she would put someone down to not make someone else mad makes me even more upset.

I have not gotten the chance to talk to Kaley about it, and to be honest, I do not even want to talk to her at all. But Kaley's sister keep telling me to not overreact and throw away a friendship over a silly comment. I do not believe that it was just a silly comment. It was hurtful and mean and judgmental.

19156,Non-Romantic,2zvtqc,"My sister ran away with her boyfriend this morning.

She started dating this boy last year, after her freshman year of college (she is 20). My parents were not exactly thrilled when they heard that he doesn't have a job, doesn't go to school and lives with his parents. He visited my parents once and things didn't exactly go great. My sister thinks that my parents were just never going to like him because they prejudged him for being from a small town in the south and wasn't from the same background as us.

Ever since they starting dating, there has been tension between my sister and my parents. It came to a head this morning when she packed up her stuff and left... it seemed pretty premeditated because her boyfriend's parents drove all the way from Louisiana to DC to pick her up. Her plan is to live with her boyfriend's family, drop out of college, get a job and attend community college classes (she wants to be a nurse).

Her primary reason for leaving is basically that my parents don't want her to be him and are trying to control her relationship. I've tried to be objective to see things from her perspective. I do think my parents pre-judged him, but I didn't think it was abnormal - I feel like the default viewpoint is always for parents to be distrusting of their daughter's new boyfriend. My sister and her boyfriend took extreme offense to this initial judgment, and ever since it seems like they felt it was not worthwhile making an attempt to win them over.

Quite frankly, I think she's blinded by love. As she was leaving I would try to reason with her. She would acknowledge all the points I was making, but then keep returning to the point that my parents were trying to intervene in her relationship.
Honestly, I don't really care if my family likes her boyfriend or not. What really concerns me is that she's dropping out of a really good college to be with him and making things a lot harder for her in the future. I'm afraid it's going to be too late when she realizes how much more difficult life is going to be without an education and without my parents supporting her. She has some health issues that could really break the bank, too. I'm also really afraid that she is eventually going to regret this decision, but feel like she can never come back.

Anyone have experience with this? A sibling running away, being blinded by love, any of it? I just don't know what to do next and feel like nobody I know can really relate.

19185,Non-Romantic,29ivty,"My friend and her boyfriend broke up a couple of weeks ago (she broke up with him) but they live together and he keeps picking fights with her. He'll call her mean, selfish, etc, and point out how everything she is doing is hurting him. He is moving out at the end of August. She keeps trying to live her life and focus on herself so she can get over her own problems with anxiety (one of the main reasons she broke up with him). I'm her only friend so she keeps asking to hang out with me and asking to come stay the night at my house. We've had problems in the past about her constantly calling and texting me and then keeping me on the phone for hours with her problems. When I talked to a school therapist months ago, she told me it's okay to say no every now and then and not always be available so I was doing pretty well. But now that she's going through a break up, and they're living together, and I'm her only friend, I feel terrible for turning her away. She asks so often that I just can't say yes all the time but I also feel bad saying no so often. I live in a small studio with my boyfriend and I'm really busy with school and work. Today she offered to pick me up from school, come stay the night, and then take me to school in the morning but I REALLY don't want her to come over so I'm considering spending the night at school. I feel like I'm going crazy and I just don't want to be a part of her break up. It shouldn't be so stressful on someone who wasn't even in the relationship that ended right? Am I being a terrible person for not letting her stay with me more often?

19204,Non-Romantic,38tk7t,"I apologise if this sounds confused, I'm a bit all over the place.

I'm a very introverted person. I recently (like 3 weeks ago) finished my college finals. Afterwards, I immediately started going to graduate fairs and events. During this time, I was still texting and snapchatting my friends (although not daily as I'm pretty quiet in general). I asked about a date I knew one girl was going on, and asked another about travel plans and got replies as normal. (I should note that I'm expected to graduate with a first class honours (or magna cum laude), and while I love my friends and they are intelligent women, they are poor students and I know one at least will fail some classes.) 

However, about a week and a half ago I went to my dermatologist with a suspicious looking mole on my face and he said that he was very concerned it could be cancerous. He prescribed me anti-inflamatories and I did a biopsy (which I haven't had results of yet). 

I'm okay about the possibility of it being cancer, as I've researched it quite a bit and I know I can fight it, but the fact that I'm a young girl starting out in life and it's on my face has upset me a bit. I didn't want to tell anyone except my boyfriend and immediate family, especially as I've not received the results yet. As a result of this, I've gone pretty quiet on all social media fronts. I was never super active, and I haven't ignored any personal messages I've received but I stopped sending snapchats, posting statuses, or starting conversations.

The issue I have now lies with my friends. When we finished college, we agreed to meet for drinks the night of one of my friend's birthdays. The plan was to organise the night in greater detail a few days beforehand when she returned from a holiday. In all the confusion I completely, forgot and only realised today was her birthday when Facebook told me. I text her to say happy birthday and got no reply. I didn't think anything of it until I saw a Facebook post of all four of my college friends in the bar celebrating her birthday without me. I was the only one of our group not there.


This is the third gathering we finished up without me, but I've only really noticed today that I'm actually being ignored/shunned. The other gatherings were sleepovers, meetups, shopping trips- not events that was discussed in advance amongst us all, so it was understandable why I wasn't kept in the loop. I'm confused as to why I didn't get any text about it when it was obviously still going ahead. I've also noticed that I've received no texts from any of them since I asked about dates and travel plans, and the only snapchats I've received are ones of them together having fun without me. 



The Facebook comments are also very passive aggressive- things like some of us still know how to have fun!, all the best friends together again!, and we learned the most important stuff in college- how to have fun!. On top of this, a mutual college friend told me last week that she'd been told by them that I was some super-busy big-shot career lady now (in three weeks, really?!?).



Maybe I'm being paranoid but I feel my friends are purposely shunning me because they think I'm ditching them in favour of graduate fairs and events, as if I think I'm better than them. My last few snapchats etc were of graduate fairs, and our university emailed a newsletter to all alumni that featured a photo of me talking to a famous chef.



However, I'm upset that they took my silence as ignoring them or being too good for them as it's not even been two weeks and they haven't bothered messaging me either. 



Basically, I'm hurt that they would ditch me and shun me and write passive aggressive FB comments about me because I go quiet for a week and a half. However, I feel that if I start telling people that I was quiet because I possibly have cancer, it'll look like I'm trying to get sympathy or they can use they oh we didn't know excuse, which might be true but isn't really relevant. I'm not sure how to keep the two issues separate. How do I broach this without letting them off the hook by claiming ignorance, or seeming like I'm desperate for sympathy/attention? I can't see any way to just not have them find out about the possible cancer thing.



EDIT My boyfriend has also put forward the possibility that they were using me for help/assistance with classes (I gave them all *tonnes* of academic help and even did some work for them all over the years). Now that they're done I'm simply not needed, and that this is a convenient excuse to ditch me. What do you guys think?


TL:DR; In the last three weeks, I've attended several graduate fairs and them went quiet on social media. Since then, my friends have been passive aggressively shunning me, possibly because they think I'm up my own ass about my good grades/career possibilities. However the reality is I've gone quiet due to a skin cancer scare. I want to hold them accountable for being dicks and discuss it without them using the fact that they didn't know about my cancer scare as a get-out-of-jail-free card, and also without making it seem like I'm trotting it out for sympathy points. Any advice? Should I even bother with these friendships anymore?","My [24F] friends [20sF] are shunning me because I've been quiet for two weeks.

19210,Non-Romantic,386toe,"So to start I guess I should say my parents have been married for almost 31 years. They have had their ups and downs but still remained together. My mother, forgive me I do not remember specifics, planned to leave because of another romantic interest about 13 years ago. She decided to come back and things have never been the same. They have separate bedrooms but remain in the same house. Split the bills but I don't think evenly.

A year ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer that was detected early and is now a survivor. During which, I had glimpsed a future where they could have been happy after she fought through the chemo and radiation. My father has never been an overly emotional man. He feels, but he does not show it. Not sure if he just doesn't know how, or something else. Which I recently found out is why my mom strayed originally. She has always loved my dad, and that was the reason she decided to come back. Through her treatment he was by her side, took off work to make sure she was taken care of. I thought things were going to be ok. 
Little did I know, she had kept in contact with this other man and apparently he was terminally I'll with cancer. He passed away about 3 months ago. My mom has been depressed and all things that lead me to believe they would be ok had gone out the window. There have been occasions where she has physically attacked my dad and I and my sister(26) have had to pull her off many times. My dad would most of the time usually just try to get away or take the assult, never calling cops or pressing charges. There has been the occasional time where he did strike her to defend himself. 

Since this other man died, and drinking has been an ongoing issue between them, my dad would apparently make remarks to her about her dead boyfriend or got what he deserved type of thing. This sets her off and she displays irrational behavior. Such as grabbing a knife and threatening him ect. When sober they are just fine to deal with. My dad has always drank beer and has always been the good times to be around drinker. My mother before her cancer was becoming too deep into vodka which would set off many fights. She has since kicked the vodka but does still drink high % beer. 

Anyway, a few weekends ago, my dad came home from being out with my uncle(brother in law). They were somewhere watching the derby I believe. This is when he got home and made a reference to the dead boyfriend and he then went to his room. This ate at my mother until she finally went to confront him. From both accounts, no one else was there, I gather she went and told him what was on her mind. He tried to go passed her to leave and she apparently grabbed a large glass vase or something similar and meant to swing it at his head. My father reacted and then grabbed her by the arms and pushed her. She apparently fell in such a way where she didn't break her fall and hit face first on the concrete ground. Broke her nose, got a concussion and also injured her spine. At first my dad was saying she needed to get up with a rag on her lacerations. It wasn't until my sister got home shortly after this, that they finally called the ambulance because there was more than they thought wrong. Being a domestic violence call and my mom the one injured my dad was arrested. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance. We would later find she had the injuries to her spine which is resulting in pending decision for surgery and not going to work all summer. My dad is staying with me and my fiance for the time being. He is not allowed to be around her. Court date was pushed back to next week. 

Now, my mom is getting better. Still has to see doctors about the future of her injuries. The problem upcoming is the courts and legal issues. Not to mention the divorce which my sister and I will inevitably be drug into. My father is not an abusive man. He has since been depressed and I don't know what to do. My mom is at home,just as depressed, with my sister and my niece staying there most of the time. My mom and sister have always butted heads and while trying to help, they become engrossed with pissing eachother off. 

I don't know what to expect with the legal proceedings because it is her word against his. I just don't want to see this get any worse. My dad has had the same job for 31 years and I don't want him to lose everything. I also don't know what my mother is planning on doing because she said to me whatever lawyer she is speaking too wants her to hang him in court. 
I don't laugh much anymore, I don't want this to affect my relationship to my wonderful fiance. I am at my wits end. Advice, guidence welcome. Thanks

19211,Non-Romantic,3ca1y5,"I'm really struggling to decide what to do about one particular cousin, I'll give you background on them and my family to start:


Loser Cousin [31M] has been in and out of rehab for drugs and alcohol for years, steals from his family and friends (this has been going on since he was a teenager), is verbally abusive to family members, spends all the money he has going on sleazy bender holidays to third world countries (drugs, alcohol, hookers etc), has never held down a (minimum wage) job for more than a couple of months and lives mostly on social security and family handouts. Oh and he knocked up his then long term girlfriend 4 years ago and has been largely absent from their child's life since it was a year old (I've never met the kid); I'm not sure he pays child support but know basic living costs for the child (daycare etc) are paid for by his mother and other family members to his ex. He's a deeply insecure pathological liar with a god complex who has almost no concept of responsibility. I could go on with dozens more examples of his scumbag ways both directly to our family and in general. However we spent a lot of time together as children/adolescents while on family holidays before any of his ‘serious issues’ started, we were never close but used to hang out at family events.


Now, where it gets complicated is that Loser Cousin’s mother has throughout his life tried to protect them from any kind of negativity: she has a ridiculous victim complex on behalf of her son – nothing is ever his fault.  This mindset has been hugely damaging to the whole extended family as half of the members have bought into it and the other half see it for what is – bullshit. I feel it’s prudent to point out that the entire family other than Loser Cousin is very well-to-do (university educated, good jobs, no illegitimate children, no substance abuse problems etc) so there are no underlying issues where his lifestyle is contextually acceptable to them. Also other than being a narcissist on behalf of her children his mother/my aunt is not a bad person, and I would actually like her to be at my wedding as in every other aspect of her life she’s a nice person and good aunt. 


Of course he's a fucking terrible person who has no place at my wedding. The issue is that we belong to a medium-large, very close extended family that I love very much. He would literally be the only cousin that would not be invited which I believe will paint me in a bad light for being exclusionary. I am the oldest of the cousins except for Loser Cousin so this is the first wedding of my/our generation if that is relevant.


A small part of me does want to stand up to the whole farce of continuing to include this piece of shit in our lives just because he’s related to us, but I also don’t want to taint my wedding with family politics and arguments, or alienate his mother/my aunt or his siblings. 


My fiancé is very mellow about the whole affair (he comes from a very small family so doesn’t ‘get’ family politics) and after extensive discussion agrees with both sides and has told me he’ll support whichever decision.


I don’t know what to do – any advice, thoughts or insight would be helpful!



**TLDR:** I’m on the fence about inviting my piece of shit cousin to my wedding: I don’t want him there but I also don’t want to re-start a bitter family argument that revolves around him.

19212,Non-Romantic,3i83lw,"sorry if this is long :(

Backstory: In 2013 my grandfather died in the later stages of dementia, now my grandmother is in the same position. My parents and I took care of my grandpa, and now we're taking care of my grandma. 

the problem: My grandmas going into the later stages of dementia and has no interest in watching tv, or knitting or absolutely any hobbies, the only thing she likes doing is walking(so we got her a gps watch), she lost it, and so we got her another, and she lost it again, we found out she was taking them off and hiding them because they were trying to kill me. That's all she says and it makes no sense, and if we don't let her walk she comes up with all these crazy ideas and tries to call the cops and just causes so much turmoil in the house that nobody is capable of getting any rest for school or work.

She is very well treated and taken care of, but everyones getting frustrated, we have had the police at our house 10 times in the last month because she called and said that someone was killing someone or something to that effect, and the police always take it really serious if they haven't dealt with her before, they have to go look up all the incident reports and it's just a huge deal all the time, and on top of that my parents are always freaking out thinking that they might get in trouble because she's constantly accusing us of abusing her.

This goes further back though, my grandmother has not been a very good person her whole life. She's manipulative/narcissistic, she's been physically/emotionally abusive to her own kids, and tried it on her grand kids as well until CPS got involved. She's a compulsive liar, and a fanatical Pentecostal, so when you combine a really toxic personality with demons and God and self-victimization and lying, and just random attention seeking behavior that you would expect out of a 7 year old, with the fact that she has dementia, her full time behavior completely consists of coming up with random abuse stories(that definitely never happened) and then a few minutes later saying that she's being raped or beaten every night and then calling the police about it, she's even ran to neighbors and asked to use their phone so she could call the police. This isn't one of those cases where abuse is happening behind everyones back, she acted this way before she had dementia, but now it's just completely out of control. Nobody in our family will deal with her and my mom is too kind hearted to let her live on the streets and be crazy. I'm just lost. I don't know what to do. My parents don't know what to do. The first thing she does when she meets someone is to tell them how horribly she's been abused. For some more insight, when she was around 50, she started writing a biography of her life, and at this time she had a full time job as a teacher and lived a completely functional life, even if she was a bad person, she definitely didn't have dementia or any cognitive issues besides being delusional. Anyways, when she was 50 she started writing a book titled The awesome miracles of god, but the whole book was about 1800 pages long and just made up stories of her and god working together through all of the abuse she endured, but it's all made up! all of it! there's not a single word of truth in the book. (I've read through the whole book, it's hilarious bathroom reading material) Her family knows shes like this, and so none of them will talk to her, she has 2 sisters and 3 brothers, and countless other family members that my parents and I are on good terms with, but everyone just despises her. There was even a bout where she had been investigated for molesting one of my cousins, but nothing ever came of it. 

I'm the only one that can still emotionally deal with her, everyone else has given up, and my moms taking care of her but they don't really get along, my moms I guess like an awkward roommate that washes her clothes and feeds her dinner and takes her to the store when she wants something(she can't drive, she hit someone and then drove off and then completely believed that the police officers were lying and that it was some big scheme to screw her over and out of her license. 

I stay up until 2-3 AM most days and now that school has started, I'm only getting three hours of sleep. My parents don't want to me stay up, but my dad has to watch her during the day because my mom works, my dad took off work to take care of her(since my moms job was better paying and she was happier working), but if someone doesn't stay up she tears the house up.

I don't think there is an answer on how to fix this situation, but I guess the main thing I want to know, is what are our alternatives? Assisted living costs an average of $3500 a month here, and we barely live off of maybe $2000 of our own living expenses? there's no way we could put out another 3500, that's just impossible. how are we suppose to afford to her the care she needs? is there nothing that can be done? I've asked my mom if her doctor would give her some sort of psych meds or something to stabilize her mood or something, she has the memory/attention span of maybe 30 seconds. 

sorry I know this was a long and clumsy collected of words but I'm so stressed and I have no idea what to do and I want to help my parents and give them good advice, because this is tearing our whole family apart. 
 
I sincerely fear for my moms health, she has RA and Anxiety problems herself, so when my grandma is having outbursts, my mom is fighting off an anxiety attack, and she does really well honestly, I don't blame her. This is out of hand. All the pressure has accumulated and it's boiling over. This would be totally different if it were someone that was a good person, there wouldn't be any problems at all I don't think. If my mom got dementia I wouldn't mind going through hell to make sure she didn't die in some nursing home. But it's not, this is my grandma, she would take candy from a baby, even if that the the only piece of candy that child would ever experience, she would still take it and eat and feel no shame. Shes that kind of person.

and after all that, when my friend calls me up and wants to go ride bmx at the local skatepark, I always have to tell them no, and it's completely by choice, I could never expect my parents to take care of her alone, she is such a handful, you guys have aboslutely no idea. She's impossible to deal with. I know she's sick and it isn't her fault, but I also know she was impossible to deal with before she got sick. I was around her frequently because my mom had a brain tumor when I was 2 years old, and my grandma took care of me a lot, and it was ridiculous back then(my step dad wasn't in the picture until I was 9)

im so sorry this is so unorganized, i'm typing on a school computer at lunch in the library and rushing. maybe I'm just being dramatic but everything seems to be crashing in on me right now. 

I just want to be a normal kid with normal home problems, not problems like this, and definitely not be consumed by my narcissistic and unfortunately sick grandma :c I guess that's selfish, but she's such a bad person. I'm so nice to her too, I don't even have any feelings for her, she's done such awful things to everyone in my family.

19231,Non-Romantic,2f4yps,"Boy oh boy I'll try to keep this as concise as possible. Also I'm aware of /r/raisedbynarcissists but I have absolutely no idea if this would qualify there because I've been stuck in this environment for the last few years, hence /r/relationships seeming like a better fit (probably... this year has sucked).


I'm (24F) the oldest of three kids and only girl. Of my two brothers (22M &amp; 20M), the youngest, Brother 2 (20M), has special needs to the point where he's mentally 7 to 10 years old. Brother 1 (22M) has just floated on by in life (went to high school, no AP/Honors classes, graduated with average grades, has never had a part-time job beside moving lawns and volunteering at a summer camp, etc.) and is transferring to a college over an hour away from home.


His move in date is less than three weeks away and with each day passing by our mother has been saying all sorts of ridiculous this doesn't make ANY sense things. The choice of his lodgings has been an issue - no one signed up for on campus housing which is key if you want your kid on campus, so our parents (dragging Brother 1) spent multiple weekends looking at condos in gated communities. Frustrated after a relator bailed on them, they caved and picked an apartment that didn't meet their expectations and thus they complain about it (it's being paid for by parents/inheritance fund - that account will be dead within two years) because Mom is convinced she can crash there at any time, but it frustrates her that the apartment comes with one parking spot and not two (one just for her). Another gem was that Brother 1 should send all of his online orders to Mom/Dad/Brother 2/Myself so one of us can drive out and deliver it to him (it would be me since my college is 30 minutes away from his), and how Mom is going to have to spend weekends showing Brother 1 how to do laundry and to drop off cooking for him (and that she'll need to cook enough food to fill his fridge BEFORE he moves).


Luckily Brother 1 and I have a solid, healthy relationship and I've been shooting down every single thing our mom has been saying ever so conveniently when Brother 1 isn't in the room/area. He can learn laundry here at home, cooking isn't a problem with him, and going from a semester system to a quarter system will cut his free time to near zippo (I asked if I could crash at his place for one weekend, and he said yes - none of this assumption crap and dropping by multiple times). When I tell Brother 1 what the latest idea is, he's horrified, but he never hears the original from Mom - she starts saying my ideas instead.


As for me? I've tried to move out before due to college, but it's not possible at this point (I even brought up the idea of Brother 1 and I sharing an apartment at a halfway point between our two colleges - that was shot down). I commute 45 minutes to over an hour to my college at least three days a week (private too - so it's costly despite getting $8,000 scholarship funds per semester) and anytime I've brought up possible places I'm told that the area is bad or there isn't enough money/need to win the lotto (even though my mom freaked out on me during the first week of summer semester saying she wasn't expecting to to cost THAT much even with a scholarship - she knew for three years) despite having an inheritance and being assured that my tuition will be paid for. I cannot work a part-time job while I'm in college due to the lack of time I have (and stupid me didn't save enough when I was working 2+ years in retail hell), but I have been trying to do freelance work (art kid here) so I could build up funds and be active in that field once I have my degree. Parents have been disapproving about going to vendor events to sell my artwork because it's full of competition (... I don't even what...), so I do my best not to tell them anything I have going on.


I don't push anything because usually an argument occurs. The latest one was during midterms this summer and I was told if I made one more mistake I'd be thrown out of the house (and yet I was hugged and told that they loved me...?). Mistakes are anything... I've spent too much money on school (supplies... oh hell the supplies... I was never given a budget and told that any expense for classes was ok) to thinking that they're stupid because it took my parents two years to finally acknowledged I wanted to kill myself when I was younger and no follow up of getting help has ever been fulfilled. I'll admit that one because my parents are of the kind that don't like to talk about anything of that sort and I foolishly thought I would be helped with such a confession. Not by them apparently.


With the move getting closer and closer... I feel like the moment that Brother 1 is out our parents (mostly Mom) are going emotionally suffocate me and not acknowledge my needs. Something else will come up and I'll get dragged into it and the threat of being kicked out will happen because my buttons will be pushed and I'll blow.


I've brought this up with a few friends. The ones that know my parents think they are panicking and grabbing onto us, mostly me (fabulous). Others that don't know my parents well say this sounds like something that happens to most people in their 20s (... please no?).


I just... I'm probably missing a few things in this post. I'm just trying to hold on and stay sane without getting kicked out, making sure Brother 1 gets a healthy distance away from Mom, and hoping that I can qualify for a study abroad semester next year so I can get some space between my parents and I.

19233,Non-Romantic,27pe4n,"I'll try to make this brief. Both my husband and I (we are both 40) are worried that a good friend of ours is drinking too much and pulling away from us and our friendship. 

This friend, I'll call her Linda (37,F) , met both of us about 6 years ago at a party. We three hit it off from day one, and started hanging out on a regular basis. We did a lot of activities together, like hiking, beer tasting (this is important - we all like craft beer), and watching movies. We'd regularly hang out at our house on Sunday evenings, making dinner, trying some beers, and watching Dexter, or GoT, or whatever series we were into at the moment. She and I talked about everything, and texted often. She helped us plan our wedding, and was my Maid of Honor.  

Fast forward about a year. I got pregnant. Obviously, I stopped beer tasting, and my husband did as well, in solidarity. We still hung out, but I was often tired, so no more late nights for me. Once my son was born, we were in newborn hell for a few months. No sleep, I had bad PPD. Eventually things calmed down, and Linda started hanging out more with us. We resumed out Sunday evening tradition, but with some small changes. We had to take a break at 8pm for bath and then bedtime. Our drinking was obviously limited (can't be buzzed around an infant), but we all still enjoyed trying a couple craft beers. 

Last summer, Linda came with us to a beer festival. She stayed with us at my cousin's house for that weekend. She ended up getting involved with my male cousin (M/38). I knew they had hooked up and I knew she really liked him, but I (and my husband) made it clear that we didn't want to get involved. Their relationship seemed pretty good, but after only a few months, my cousin broke it off. I'm not sure of the details (I didn't ask and I don't want to know). Linda was heartbroken. She got very cool towards my husband and I for a bit. Finally, she invites me out to lunch, and basically blames my husband and I for not being more forthcoming about my cousin and his feelings/intentions. I tried telling her that I had no idea, I knew nothing, and I wasn't privy to any special information that I didn't pass onto her. She also tells me that my husband and I are too much about our child. That we talk about him too much and let him rule our lives too much. Now, this is where I got offended. Yes, we do talk about him, but that is to be expected. He is not the only thing we talk about, however. We do have other interests. Keep in mind that our child, that at this point, was not even a year old. I'm not sure what Linda was expecting, but of course we do a lot for him! He is a BABY. It's not like we can dump him in his crib and go out drinking. We are good parents, and we take our responsibilities seriously. I was really upset and hurt after this lunch. First, her basically saying that we were lying and withholding information about my cousin, and then telling me that we are too much about our child. I repeated all this to my husband and he was LIVID. 

I think it's also important to note that Linda's hooking up with my cousin is the only relationship we are aware of her having in the whole time we've known her. She's tried online dating, and never had any luck. She's been single for maybe 10+ years. I know she wants a partner and children, she's stated that numerous times. 

Since this, she's come by a few Sundays, but always leaves early. We've invited her to go bike riding with us several weekends, and she's always too hungover (at like 4pm in the afternoon). I try texting her (not about my child, since I feel like she doesn't want to hear it), but she often doesn't answer anymore. We've also noticed more and more posts on Facebook about her beer tasting. We are all friends on a beer tasting ap, and she checks in multiple beers a night, every night. She's also been up to visit the area where my cousin lives and casually bumping into him. I'm not sure what's going on there, but my brother knows that Linda is going up to see my cousin. He has spoken to my cousin, and my cousin has no interest in a relationship with her. But if she comes up and wants to hook up, he figures why not (I won't get into my cousin being an asshole here). 

I am pregnant again, and Linda was clearly acting strained when we told her our good news. Since then, she has been blowing us off more and from what we see on social media, drinking even more. I'm not sure saying anything to her would be a good idea. It will probably only upset her and make her pull away more. Is there anything my husband and I can do? Is this just the slow death of what was a great friendship? Did we do something wrong? Are we in such different stages of our lives now that friendship is impossible?

My daughter was very upset and I see it as completely disrespectful especially considering how much time I spend watching their kids. I don't want to start (or in this case continue) a bunch of drama so I'm trying to find a measured response.** 

We watch these kids very regularly as they like to play in our backyard all of the time. Our kids have been running around together for 2 years now and, despite the usual childish fights, they seem to be good friends. However she came home crying because when she went to her friend's house for her birthday party (which she's been talking about for weeks) she was turned away. She was completely destroyed, though being 4 years old an offer of chocolate milk eased her pain temporarily. 

I went to the friend's house just to tell the parents what happened and make sure it wasn't just a misunderstanding. Obviously I wasn't about to start shit on her daughter's birthday so I just asked if my daughter was or wasn't invited. The mom turned to ask her daughter if she had invited mine to which she said No. I get the impression that this was all an act though since the mom didn't invite her over but instead said well she was only allowed to invite 6 people. 

I'm not an idiot, I can tell when someone isn't welcome, and I get that kids have friends who are closer than others, so I obviously didn't press the issue, I just said I understand if you don't want to invite her over and left. However I don't think I should let this go without repercussion. Not only am I pissed that they hurt her feelings so badly, but I'm also pissed because I've spent hours of my time watching their kids and dealing with their crap only to have them turn around and reject her. 

I'm not sure how to proceed with this. I don't want to ban their kids from coming over as that will only isolate my kid. I was thinking of limiting their visiting time to between certain hours since they insist on disrespecting us. I'm trying to find a measured response that won't make things worse but will still get the point across to my daughter that you can't treat people like that. Thoughts?

19284,Non-Romantic,284xbn,"I live in a shared house with my partner and one other couple. 

When it comes to dishes, the other couple are rather slow about cleaning up. Also, if my partner and / or I have cleaned up the kitchen and made it nice, the other couple will often leave mess straight away and again not clean it up till the next day or the day after. Generally we end up with a kitchen space that is more often messy than not. 

It would be my preference that we cleaned up after we use our stuff, but also I understand that this is not always practical if people are tired, or insanely busy for example.

So what happens often, is that my partner will clean up after them, or I will. My partner also hangs out their washing if they leave it in the machine, which happens most of the time now.

I've noticed that all this is becoming a more common occurrence since I've recently moved into the place (it was her and them for the first 6 months) 

My partner would rather just get on and clean their stuff, but I'm only here 3 days a week, and I'd rather be doing other things than essentially be mother to them (which it's starting to feel like with the dishes more and more). 

A while back, my partner blew up about this with them, and the girl of the other partner made a massive issue about how my partner dealt with that, (slamming the door and leaving the house to buy food, as they'd eaten what she'd looked forward to for dinner). Her making a big deal of my partner being angry became the issue, rather than my partner being sick of their mess. 

In general, they're really nice people, but just give the message that 'they'll get to it eventually' and that the subtext is that we all chip in is the norm and that's fine (whereas the reality is that they're just not thoughtful about our time). 

How do I raise this in a rational way and not make it seem personal?

One thing I was thinking is to point out that throwing a load of dirty dishes in the sink and leaving them there, is 'in the way' and not being able to use stuff without having to wash it is inconvenient - and that I'd like them to be more considerate. But I feel if I say this, they will agree but then soon lapse. So it's as if I need to be able to remind them constantly about it, but not feel like a nag - Impossible? - is there some way to record things and not come off as petty? 

A likely response from them will be we always get to it eventually, but it's not realistic to expect us to be perfect

I know there's a million ways to say this, but I'm just trying to sidestep the things that may be said that are taken personally. 

I would like to be breezy about it, but I feel I'd be emotional as they're taking advantage of my partner - and now me. 

Any relevant advice much appreciated.

I liked him back then but when I changed schools I lost contact with him and I've never seen him since. He ran into me a month ago on campus, I was surprised to see him and we had a nice conversation but then realized he is so changed (or maybe I am) that I couldn't stand him at all! Very lame jokes, wants me to go with him everywhere, his friends make fun of him in front of him and me and he just laughs along and stands there not knowing what to do. When I asked him to leave them he said they were his friends blah blah. What a weak personality!

So today I was with my friends and he ran into me again (without noticing I was with my friends) and said hi how are you etc. then asked me to walk with him to his class. In my head I was like FUCK YOU I have my own university life let your friends walk you to class. So I told him I needed to go home.

19305,Non-Romantic,2u4019,"I’m so confused and hurt over this situation, I need advice or for someone to look at this from a different perspective. I will try to be as brief as possible.

I have a pretty large and active social group. One of my best friends (Melissa, 39)has a birthday coming up. I received a call from another close friend (Judy. 43) basically stating that there is a birthday lunch being planned for Melissa but that me and my ex were being deliberately excluded and she wanted me to know and not find out about it via Facebook or the like.

Backstory: My ex is part of the same friend group. We had a very rocky relationship that ended about 6 months ago. We did argue and fight a lot, but have grown to accept that we will need to be around each other sporadically and attempt to remain friendly.
 
I am hurt and offended beyond belief by being told I am being deliberately excluded (along with my ex) from this birthday thing. I don’t really know how to react. I was so upset I hung up on Judy and, after texting back and forth a few times, stopped responding at all. I have been a wreck and feel like I am going ot lose two close friends over this. The reasoning is that they don’t want us there together, but feel it unfair to invite either of us and exclude the other. The fact is had they talked to my ex he would have gladly told them he would sit out to spare my feeling. It may be a bit melodramatic but I feel as if I’ve been hit by a truck.

I don’t know what to do or how to feel about all of this. I spend a lot of time with these two women and considered them two of my very closest friends and now I feel like absolute shit and like I mean nothing to them. Melissa has not said a word ot me about anything at all. I am devastated, and it is not really over the exclusion from the event, which sucks but it happens, but from the callous way I feel I was treated. How should I react to this?

19309,Non-Romantic,1yjh74,"Hello everyone! So my friend and I have known each other for almost a decade and I love her to death. We've been through so many hard times and have always stuck together. I seriously cannot imagine not having her in my life. We love just sitting around, sipping wine and talking about the future, dating and life. The dating topic is now the problem. 

I am a serial dater, but have recently settled down with someone that I am head over heels with. He's not my traditional type, actually he's completely opposite than what I normally go for, but he's just an incredible person, so I don't care about whatever type I've held in my mind all this time. My friend also has a type that she goes for, but as time goes on I realize how completely unrealistic these expectations are. She has never had a relationship (dating or just sexual) before in her life due to this extreme fixation on the perfect boyfriend. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have some standards and not just settle for anyone, but this is getting insane. 

Now this is the part that I'm going to sound like a terrible person and an even more terrible friend. I love my friend dearly, I really do. She is a wonderful person: kind, friendly, smart, driven and has a wonderful soul. She's a little introverted, but opens to the people she likes. The only thing is that she is tall and 150+ lbs overweight. She has so much to offer, but I feel like that her physical appearance does hold her back a bit from landing this perfect man that she has created in her head. She only pursues the traditional hot man (i.e. 6'4'', tan, six pack abs, extremely successful, gorgeous smile, ect ect), without even giving anyone else a chance. An inch shorter than her (she's about 6 foot)? Nope. A little overweight? Nope. Doesn't love all the things she loves? Nope. Not even a second look. Again, standards are fine, but..come on. 

This is where I am stuck and need advice. This fixation is starting to strain our friendship. I want to be a good friend and get her with a good guy, but anyone I've ever tried to set her up with doesn't exactly meet her insanely high standards. It's also always hard because she never wants to hear about my relationship because she hates couples. Guys will try to talk with her, she turns them down. This is starting to cause tension with her complaints about being single and everyone in the city being awful to date. It's really stressing me out and is hurting out friendship as a whole since this is all we talk about. I don't know how to work through this and also try to get her to realize that this perfect guy doesn't really exist. Then then also, without sounding like the worse person in the world, try to get her to realize that if you are going for that perfect physical body type, it's really hard to get that person when you yourself isn't exactly...complimenting it. God that sounds awful, sorry. 

What do I say to her? How can I help? How do I say anything without destroying any self-esteem?

My brother and I were never close growing up since we went to different boarding schools and had different interests. Two years ago he confided to me that he was gay and he has known for his entire life. I supported him and told him he should live the way he sees best but it didn't matter because we were both living in the US at the time.

Since he has moved back home (an Arab gulf country) and is settled there with a good job. My parents keep urging him to get married, but obviously he refuses. He recently told me he plans to come out to our family and his friends because it's his life and he wants to live it openly and freely.

I don't know what to do and whether I should support or dissuade him. It's punishable by law to engage in sexual activity with other men in my country. My parents would be livid and I could easily see them disowning him. He would definitely never be able to find another job, and I don't know but his current one might fire him. I told him to move back the US but he doesn't want to, his life is home and he didn't enjoy the US very much.

One of my very best friends and I are going on a mini-vacation to see a few other friends from our college days next week. We're going to a city that I've never been to before and I couldn't be more excited to share this experience with her. The problem is that she has just filed for divorce and has requested that none of us post pics or statuses of any kind indicating that we are there....ever. The divorce isn't nasty, but it's not amicable. He's not causing any issues and they don't have very much to split when it comes to property or money. He's a nice guy and I'm very sad to see them split, but I really feel like she's trying to spare his feelings by not exposing something so simple as a trip. She says that she doesn't want him to think that she's just gallivanting around. So what if she is???? I've advised her before that I think it's best for them to also break up via social media and she should block him (and I, of course, would do the same if she wanted me to), but she says that she's not ready to answer to everyone that might ask what has happened. I get that...I'm divorced, but I don't recall there being any kind of social media meltdown when I took back my maiden name and took down the relationship status. 

So, am I being too insincere and uncompassionate about this? Should she be able to dictate this kind of thing? How do I approach this with her or do I just let it go? 


   
**tl;dr**: Best friend and I are going on vacation. She has requested no trace of it online/social media. Do I sympathize and go along with request or tell her she's being unrealistic?

EDIT: I wanted to do a little bit of an update to answer some of the resounding questions/comments in the thread. First of all, no matter how you slice it, I'm not being a shitty friend by simply ASKING if it's appropriate for her to dictate my and our friends' social media. I would never tag her in anything if that was her request. I would never post anything inappropriate and connect it to her (or even myself) as we are both in higher education and respect our positions. Also, I rarely post anything about my personal life. Will it kill me to just stay off of social media and enjoy the trip? Nope. But I'll be taking pictures and at some point I will want to post them somewhere. Let me make this clear as hell for folks that are just skimming the post: I would NEVER EVER consider posting anything on social media that a friend or even a stranger asked me to keep from social media if it meant that they in any way could be jeopardized for it. The main question that I have is about her specifying that we can't post anything about the trip...not even that we were there implying that it includes pics and posts that she is not tied to. 

For those of you that took the time to give a thoughtful answer, thank you. After doing the reading I've realized that she probably just wants a break from it all and she's probably taking the lay low for awhile advise from her attorney. That was an angle that I hadn't considered before and I'm grateful to have seen it in this aspect now. I'll just take her lead and see how she handles it. I'll take photos and share them after the trip AFTER talking to her about what's appropriate.

19324,Non-Romantic,3dxauz,"My wife and I have been married 5 years, together 8. We have a great marriage but my wife has recently come to me saying she now hates my mom. Apparently, slowly over the years my mom has been inappropriate with her, touching her in ways that make her uncomfortable and asking intimate questions. As examples, apparently my mom likes to try and stroke my wifes hair, (I've never seen this) and asks about our sex life and masturbation. My wife Karen has told my mother she doesn't like the touching on multiple occasions yet she continues to do it, or tell her that her questions aren't any of her business. I've asked my mom why she asks these things, she denies it but I believe my wife and tell my mom to knock it off. I know my mom can be emotionally needy, but my dad, sisters and I don't pander to her.


My wife is pregnant with our third and due in three months, she hates my mom touching her belly, with the hair stroking thing I don't blame her and Karen has started avoiding and ignoring her because she doesn't listen to her boundaries. Just for the record, I have told my mom to please leave Karen be, she doesn't like people grabbing her belly but Mom tries to guilt me saying she just wants to be close to us all and masks it as excitement over the new baby.


Karen is staying to get super pissed and is talking about not letting my mom see the kids alone or babysit anymore because she feels my mom is emotionally manipulative, crying and guilting her when she doesn't get her way with Karen and she doesn't want our kids to grow up used to grandma emotionally manipulated or seeing it as okay or normal.


We've tried sitting down with mom and outlining what we feel is inappropriate and how she can't be acting like that, it's not okay and she'll say she gets it but then acts like really we all hate her or makes the excuse that that's just how she shows love. But she always find a way to do or say something that inevitably gets her in trouble again. Yeah, my mom is kind of an idiot, and in trying to be close is only pushing us to keep her at arms length. I feel bad for her, but fully support my wife. I'm afraid that things are only going to escalate, possibly to the point were Karen will insist my mom not see our kids at all, which I don't feel is acceptable.

19346,Non-Romantic,2du3cu,"I'm a twenty year old student in the UK facing growing problems with my mum. I've started trying to arrange to talk to a counsellor about this, but for the time being I both need to vent, and get some advice. 

Growing up, mine and my mother's relationship was often somewhat tense, but dealable. She was a stay at home mum with low grades, whereas I always had high aspirations in the STEM field. We were very different people, she would often put herself down in terms of her abilities, and this angered me and made it harder for me to properly respect her. An additional tension on our relationship came from her essentially encouraging me back into the closet age 12 (I am now an out and proud lesbian with a long term girlfriend, despite trying my hardest to be straight for about 7 years). 

Whilst I was still in school, my mum had an stroke-like attack that was later diagnosed as haemoplaeglic migraines. These attacks caused stroke like symptoms when they happened, including face drooping, and difficulties using one side of her body. Since me leaving for university, her condition has progressively worsened. She is currently diagnosed with severe depression and severe fibromyalgia. She now needs a crutch to navigate the house, and a wheelchair if she is going more than a short distance from it. 

There are things she could be doing to help her condition. She had been told (over a year ago, before the wheelchair was needed) that trying to improve her diet a little, and very light exercise (a short walk or swim) would help her to feel better. Instead she continues to barely eat (only ever see her eat toast when I visit) and her physical mobility has declined. She supposedly only sleeps when she randomly falls asleep, which can be anywhere, including the kitchen floor. She regularly has falls and doesn't get checked out afterwards. 

I'm struggling to deal with this for many reasons. I'm angry because I feel she is partly inflicting this on the family (my dad and two younger siblings) by her lack of trying to help herself at all. I have lost all respect for her because of this. I dislike her as a person. She is now someone who is constantly self deprecating, and goes out of her way to make me feel bad with little comments, e.g. 'did you sleep okay last night? Oh good, I didn't, I was up til 4 then your dad found me asleep on the kitchen floor'. These are regular, and Wear me down very quickly. 

I've reached the point where I hate visiting home. I spend maybe a total of two weeks a year there, and every time I visit I come away depressed, hating her, and hating myself for feeling that way. I dread her answering the phone when I ring. I feel shit that I can't help my dad and younger siblings, and that I barely see then because of her. I know she's depressed, I know it's not all her fault, but I can't get past how I feel, and can't deal with leaving her house wanting to cry, and dealing with intrusive thoughts. I just don't know what to do, at all, and need any advice people have. Thanks.

My family is mom, dad, 2 sisters, and me (youngest). In general, all things are well, except that for the past 12 years, the relationship between my mother and my oldest sister have been uncomfortable; evasive at times; brazenly offensive at others. None of these occurrences have been exactly private, which is precisely how I, and often times others, know about them.

Most recently, incidents at two significant family gatherings have brought these issues to a head: on my mother's birthday, at a dinner table with only 7 people in total, my sister had a few too many and began to openly talk shit about my mother *with her sitting only 2 feet away*. I was present for this, and it was disastrous.

The second event was more monumental for my sister: two families were now gathered and celebrating, and (so I heard later, I was asleep at the time) during the dying hours of the celebration, she had too many and *unleashed a tirade of vitriol against the entire other half of the now-joined families.*

Some people in her life have approached her about a drinking issue - she seems to have avoided all of them. I am too cowardly to approach her about it.

Things are certainly tense, but it now seems evident that she will never be attending any family gatherings...she says she won't interfere in their relations with her children, though.


I am perplexed with and furious at both of them (parents - sister). I do not understand how someone can be so pig-headed as to not be able to just put some petty nonsense behind you, or to seek professional help when you are clearly having issues that come out when you drink. No one is without fault, not even me. I do not want my family to fall apart. I'm reaching out to middle sister to try and talk this through, but I truly fear that my father and my sister are both too headstrong, nearsighted, and egotistical to see the destruction this rift will cause.


I also seek help from the internet. Please help me understand this, if you can, with what little I've given you.

Edit: Okay, I wasn't clear about my parents. My parents are old school Irish Catholic and traditionally, we're all emotionally closeted. My mother seems to have the coping skills of a 15-yr old, and throws tantrums, screams, cries, and slams doors when she gets too upset. My father generally (at least with me) responds with rage, some physical violence, and very terse language (as well as ultimatums).

I have this group of friends since high school and surprisingly we all managed to stay together through uni and ended up all back in the same city after. There are 6 of us, 5 girls and 1 guy. There is one girl in the group, I'll call Amber, that I find really hard to be around. To preface, I feel really bad for being so intolerant about her and really want to find a way to accept her, because she is a nice girl. 

The best way I can think to describe Amber is that she has the personality of an 8 year old girlie girl. I'll bullet point some details:

- She talks in a very high pitch cutesy voice all the time, like one would talk to a baby. 
- Her whole identity revolves around her size. She will take any topic and make it relate to this. We could be discussing Russian politics (we don't) and we'll find some way to interject because I'm so tiny!!. It's seriously about 10 times every time I see her. She isn't happy in a conversation if it's not able her size. 
- She never adds anything relevant or meaningful to a conversation. She's not dumb, I think she lacks the social skills which I feel bad about
- She does this earth shattering high pitch squeal for all kinds of reasons. Responding to something someone says, seeing something cute, play fighting with the guy in our group. It can almost break glass. 
- She's SO innocent that any kind of adult conversation gets her really uncomfortable. You have to walk on eggshells around her. 

One more thing about the group. Other then her, all the girls were very big, so the obsessing over her size and skinniness is a bit insensitive I think. A couple of years ago I lost a lot of weight and am now skinny myself. She doesn't seem to like this much because she was the skinny one. Every time someone mentions my weight loss or calls me skinny she gets this big pout and says well, I'm skinny too.... She still relishes in the fact that she's smaller (6 inches shorter then me) but hates anyone else getting attention about that. 

I see Amber all the time but not one on one. No one else has a problem with her. I have discussed this with the girl I'm closest with in the group and she agrees she can be annoying but isn't bothered like I am. I know it's my problem, but as time goes on and we get older I feel her behaviour is more and more inappropriate and harder to deal with. I have to leave the room at times because I'm so annoyed. 

I want to stay friends with this group which means having to put up with Amber, but does anyone have any suggestions as to how to not let her get to me so much?

19354,Non-Romantic,2fs0b8,"Husband is in the military, we relocated to Las Vegas in the last few months, after living in the mid west. Both our families are in California, which is about a 3.5 hour drive away, everyone's excited we're close to them again. Or maybe they're excited we live in a cool town to visit?

Since we're from California, and vegas has a lot of California transplants, I know a handful of people here that have been friends for years, and the running joke between all of them seems to be how they can't remember their last free weekend without guests. I'm starting to realize this isn't a joke. This is putting me in a really awkward position because everyone seems to think they can use our house as a free inn. 

I'll start with my BFF, let's call her Leslie. I love Leslie to pieces, we've been dear friends since we were 10, we were roommates at one point, and I'm far closer to her than i am with any of my sisters. Leslie unfortunately married a man that is such a sack of shit, I could literally go on and on about the many awful things he's done, but in an effort to keep it short: he's been unemployed for their entire 5-year marriage, they've basically hated each other's guts since they tied the knot, he is very condescending to her, constantly belittles and puts her down, berates her in public places, tells her she's too fat for him to sleep with, threatened her with a gun once.... honestly you can't have a conversation with this guy without him trying to pick a fight, he lacks impulse control, and frankly has zero redeeming qualities from what I can see. I can't handle this guy for 10 minutes, I think he's abusive. Leslie's incredibly religious, and will never leave him. Fine, not my life, but after years of encouraging her to do what makes her happy, it seems she's happy being miserable with him, and gets incredibly defensive if I imply that he doesn't treat her well, so I keep my mouth shut. Well they want to visit. Leslie will always be welcome in my home, and I really want to see her, but I do not want her husband anywhere near my home or especially my baby. When I said this (in the nicest way I could), she got very upset and now isn't speaking to me. I'm not sure if advice can even be given on this one, because this is not negotiable, and I will not relent and let this man near my family.

Issue #2: cousins of my husband want to visit. We say ok, they're coming next week, with their 3 kids in tow, and I got an email today saying how the wife is so excited to come because they haven't gone on a date in forever, and husband already bought tickets to a show, and a kid-free night is just what they need! Uhh, is it just me, or does it sound like they're under the impression that I'm baby-sitting? One of her kids is an infant, one is fully in the throes of the terrible twos, and the four-year-old in my opinion has some serious behavioral problems. I don't mind them visiting for a weekend, but I am NOT babysitting these kids. What the heck do I get out of this arrangement? They didn't outright say they expected me to babysit, so should I wait to see how this plays out (with the wild hope that they just have a sitter lined up or something), or immediately say NO THIS ISNT HAPPENING?

Issue #3: FIL showing up at our house unannounced, saying a quick hello, then leaving for the casino, and after a night of gambling, stumbling in our house at 3:30 am drunk off his ass. WAKING MY SLEEPING INFANT. Husband flew off the handle, and yelled at his dad a bit. FIL gathers that the unannounced part was the issue, and tells us he's coming for a visit in a couple of weeks, so we're prepared.

Issue #4: husbands grandparents are pressuring me to host thanksgiving and christmas, because if I don't, no one else will. I don't want 20 people camping out in my house!

It doesn't even stop there, even people I haven't talked to in years suddenly want to friend me on Facebook, and send me emails like, ohhhhhhh you're in vegas?? I should come visit! Friends and family; it's overwhelming.

My husband is generally not confrontational (making the scene with his father a HUGE shock to me), and doesn't want to be rude. He doesn't see family and friends visiting as a bad thing, and likes to be very social. I like to be social too, but he's not the one cooking and cleaning and hosting and apparently babysitting. It's causing some tension between us.

19384,Non-Romantic,35892p,"I'm 34, and have been friends with this guy since we were about 14. In the last four or so years, he split up with his wife, and this has escalated his depression to the point where I feel I need to seriously intervene.

John split up with his wife about four years back. His weight had always been an issue for him, but back then, and when he was younger, it was nowhere near as bad as it is now. The split with his wife, and the change in his living circumstances (having to move to a horrible flat with neighbours who harassed him) led to his long standing issues with depression becoming worse.

He ended up having to get out of that place, and basically was living in a storeroom in a pub (bed, tv, and shared bathroom) for around a year. During this time, he developed alcohol problems and this got to the point where he admitted to me he was drinking a bottle of vodka each day. His weight also ballooned to a massive degree.

About two years ago, John got a flat of his own in a nicer area, and I was really positive for him. It started well, but his depression, anxiety, and drinking came back and have slowly gotten worse since. His flat started out clean at first, but quickly descended into squalor, just filth and rubbish everywhere.

Two years on, John is at the point where his anxiety stops him going to most social events, his weight stops him being able to stand or walk for more than about 20 minutes, and if he does turn up to any kind of social event it's usually drunk, and he leaves after an hour. He also has increasingly poor hygiene. Recently, an argument with his mother ended up with him downing half a bottle of paracetomol with vodka and being hospitalised. 

During these last four years, I have had John over to my place many times, just to see how he was doing, and to get him out of the places he was in. I've helped him move out of his awful flat, and then out of the pub storeroom. I've met up with him many, many times to try and be supportive, listen, give advice. I know it has helped at least a little, he has told me many times how much he appreciates me being there for him. He has also been under counselling from his doctor and from local addiction services. 

But in my opinion none of that has really helped in the long run. He is slowly going downhill, and I suspect that sooner or later it will kill him. I'm a nurse by profession, and I'm terrified he develops type 2 diabetes, as he won't control it at all and I may see him at work having a foot amputated.

I am at the point where I feel I need to have an intervention of some sort with him. I believe his weight is the number one thing that is decreasing his level of physical and mental health, and that gastric surgery will be the only thing that allows him to lose the amount of weight he needs to in order to start improving.

However, I don't want to meet him, and suddenly start patronising him by preaching at him You need a gastric bypass!, but at the same time, I feel I need to get tougher with him. 

Any help is greatly appreciated on how to approach this. Thank you.

At the same time, I've gone through many major changes in my life, and while having psychological problems, my life is headed in a good direction.


However, I feel that my friend never really lets me share things from my life, and when I tell her something I'm happy or proud about, I feel that she always criticizes me and talk about how she would do it, implying that she would do it better (for example working out). She always makes assumptions on what I'm talking about, and I basically have to argue for her to actually listen to what I'm trying to say.

19390,Non-Romantic,2zbsxt,"So a couple weeks ago, my 18F friend, we'll call her S, told me she was having problems with my 18M Friend, who we'll call A. 


Bit of background on my relationship with S: 
I used to like her for a long time during MS/HS. But after a while I saw her true personality and how she kind of fakes her personality to cover some sort of darkness inside. That's when I stopped liking her and was just her acquaintance.


Background on me and A's relationship: We're pretty chill, we respect each other and know each other pretty well.


Now onward:


When she came to me a couple of mutual friends of A and I already knew there was something up. This just confirmed my suspicions.


S has been ignoring A for maybe about 1-2 months. The reasoning behind this was because A was bit rude to her in Facebook group chats, told her to shut up often, was a bit perverted at times, and also had the audacity to ask her for rides and food (which she always relented)


So far, seems reasonable for S to be mad at A. I would too.


But at that point, mutual friends of S, A , and I all sit at the same table during lunch, and when A walks over and joins us (happened everyday) S would leave and go off somewhere else. This eventually really hurt group dynamic. S never communicated with A at all about why she was angry at him. She left A in the dark about everything.


I should probably talk about A a lil bit. 


He's a great guy actually. Hella funny, but a bit brash sometimes and has trouble seeing boundaries. My friends and I know he's joking all the time, but S doesn't and she took some of his stuff too seriously. The shut up comments were made in the vicinity of the group chat, so any joking tone obviously wasn't heard. 


Now A was left in the dark about this, and recently discovered it when we told him that S was mad at him.  Now A realizes this and wants to apologize, and first does it over Facebook (bad move) and then I told him to do a face to face apology. 


A also asked me what he was doing wrong. I felt like it was a good idea to tell him. He was kept in the dark, so he wouldn't learn at all if no one told him what he was doing wrong. I was the only person who knew, because S told me.


Now fast forward to today, where A apologizes to S after school. S and I walk to where we parked our cars and she immediately says, You told him didn't you and I'm like Yeah I did, it was the right thing to do


I told her that A was kept in the dark, and that he didn't know what he was doing wrong. By telling him what he was doing wrong, you effectively teach him what's right and whats wrong around people like S. I wanted A to learn about boundaries because around his friends, there are no boundaries because we are so familiar with his mode of comedy. 


She immediately says You're supposed to be on my side and How could you betray me and stuff like that, which I kept responding, I wanted to help you guys mend the relationship, so I did the right thing. It'll help him learn about boundaries and what not to do next time. She didn't respond to me after that moment and when I messaged her on Facebook this is what she said: (summary)


Her way of dealing with people who anger her: She ignores them because it isn't right to confront them. If she confronts them she'll snap.



My response: how can you expect someone to grow up (which is what she wanted A to do) when she won't even communicate effectively with A to tell him why she's pissed?


Then she says how I always don't take her side and always take my other friends' sides and how I always turn on her. 


(there's a bit of back-story on this: last year she rejected guy number 1 that I mention later in this post, (he asked her to prom) then subsequently said yes to some other guy. She lied to his face about, because she said that she wasn't going to prom. I obviously took guy number 1's side and she got mad at me for that too and we also had a huge argument about that as well. I feel like her anger from that surfaced a bit too)



My response: how can you get angry at someone whos trying to help the situation? I told A what he wanted to know so he could learn from it is that so bad? I gave her the analogy of You don't get angry at the firefighter for rescuing the kitten do you?


and she laughed it off. She told me that I was being needy or something (no idea where that came from) and I told her to grow up and not be a drama queen. That was the last thing I said to her


S went to 3 other people, who all hinted to other people that there was some shit going on between A and S. S (in my honest opinion) blew this whole argument between her and A way out of proportion. Those three people:
1. has a huge crush on her, also close friends with A but wouldn't do shit because he'd stay on her side. (guy number 1)
2. an good guy but somewhat anti social, wouldn't do anything either
3. and me, someone who tried to keep quiet but ended up not because I wanted my friend to learn through his mistakes.


Overall I feel like S is an attention whore and a drama queen, who really doesn't give shits about people just wants people to be focused on her.

So my fiancé and I have been dating for 3 years now, and just got engaged 5 days ago. We're both graduating from college this semester, and he has a job lined up 15 hours away from where we currently live that starts in June. We're talking about getting married in November, and we don't want to attempt to plan a wedding and a huge move both during this last semester of college. I also don't want to leave him alone to deal with a cross country move and a new job and planning a wedding for six months either. 

I currently live at home with my very conservative parents who believe living together before marriage is wrong, and will be incredibly upset when they find out. I know this is going to be a rough thing to tell them, and will cause a lot of fallout, but this is what will be best for us. 

My question is, what is the best way/time to approach this? Questions are already starting about what our plans are going to be, so I'm thinking we need to tell them sooner rather than later. I want to be respectful and attempt to keep communication open between us as I'm going to be living with the for the next five months. Thank you!

I ended up doing worse in the class than if I had just gotten the questions wrong, but more importantly my friend now hates me. I apologized profusely and emailed the professor accepting responsibility, but he refuses to award my friend back his points.

19414,Non-Romantic,26n12e,"I [24 F] will soon be going on a 3 week long business trip to a city in northern Mexico. An old colleague of mine [40M] lives in the city I will be travelling to. A couple of years ago he worked in my city (in the UK) for a year and during that time we got on reasonably well - we were never particularly close friends, but he always came across as a nice guy. 


When I found out that I was going on this trip, I contacted him to let him know and asked if he'd like to meet up, and be willing to show me around. He said he was happy to do so - and then got back in touch with my boss (they are friends) and I to offer me his spare room free of charge while I am there.


My boss is keen on me staying with him because it will make the whole trip cheaper. I was initially relieved at his offer, because the city I'm going to does have a problem with crime related to the drug trade and my colleague lives in the nicest part of the city and has good security, so it will mean having somewhere nice and to stay. My colleague always seemed a bit old-fashioned and gentlemanly, and was concerned about the safety of his female coworkers when he worked in my city - he always made sure that myself and other young women we worked with got home safely if we'd been drinking together by insisting on either walking us home or calling us cabs. So I am mostly sure that by offering his spare room he is trying to look out for me while I am in an unfamiliar city.


Still - it feels a bit weird. He is considerably older and single. (I am not single, which my colleague knows) I don't feel like we have ever been close enough friends for him to be this generous without wanting something in return. Is there any chance he's going to be expecting something from me? Even if his intentions are completely selfless, I'm going to feel like I'm in his debt the whole time I'm there, which will be a bit awkward.


Redditors, can you put my doubts to rest? Does it sound like my colleague is just being a genuinely nice guy, in which case I should just stay in his nice house and get him a present to say thanks? Or do you think there's a chance that he is offering because he wants the chance to watch a young woman walk around his house in a towel...?

19430,Non-Romantic,2juoa9,"Background: S and I have known each other since I was 14. Over the past couple of years we have become closer, and could be titled as best friends. For the past two years I have been dating people but not seriously. S just recently became single. Before N, we used to go out to dinner or on adventures (we live in the mountains) with each other to shoot the breeze, have deep convos, or plan future adventures. There has never been any type of romantic feelings between us. 

N and I have known each other for about 4 years. We are really good friends and ex coworkers. We have the same type of interests and humor (and I would bring up to S how much I thought he would like her if I had her hang out with us sometime since he has the same type humor and most of the same interests). N never dates. 

Story: After S and his long time girlfriend broke up. I invited N to come on an adventure with S, our friend M, and I. S and N hit it off and added each other on FB. (Awesome! No awkwardness. We are all getting along.) Soon after N, S, and I had a near constant group text constantly going to make plans, send funny pics, talk about funny things on campus and at work.. normal friend things. 

Recently however, every time I try to make plans with S, or vice versa, he always mentions inviting N. Always. It makes me feel like he doesn't want to spend one-on-one time with me anymore. 

Then, he went to visit her at her job and they ended up spending a few hours together afterwards to hang out. This would normally never bother me, but S has never visited me while I'm working (N and I have the same type of job, different locations). So, I felt a little jealous.

But the icing on the cake is that when I was hanging out with him last time (while we waited for N to arrive) he went on and on about how he bought her a birthday present, and how cool it was, and how he was sure she was going to love it. He had forgotten my birthday this year (my 21st birthday) and definitely didn't get me any type of anything. We normally don't get each other presents, so the fact that he looked for something special for N after knowing her for such a short amount of time made me feel a bit hurt and jealous. 

So, I guess my point is that I'm afraid of becoming a third wheel. I've been pretty lonely being single for so long. So, having such wonderful friends to spend time with and talk to has been so uplifting. I am so grateful for their friendship and am afraid of it changing. 

Should I confront S about his feelings towards N? Am I acting petty and jealous? Should I just try to be happy for them if they do end up dating?? Please help!

19431,Non-Romantic,2rxcxu,"Hi, /r/relationships. I hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year. This is my first post in this subreddit, so I'm going to try to keep this short and on subject. I live in a household with my younger sister and mother, following our abusive father leaving the picture. Since he's left, my mom has started dating another man, who has a son the same age as my little sister. Mom's boyfriend, 'Michael', is a good man that we all get along with and trust. He's a better father to my sister and I than our biological dad ever was. 

However- his spoiled eleven year old son 'Alex' is another story entirely.

For the most part, Alex is a good kid. May not be the sharpest crayon in the box, but he's a very good hockey player (this is an important tidbit to remember) and he means the world to his dad. His mother isn't, and hasn't ever been much of a part in his life, so his dad takes over both family roles, with help from grandparents. I treat the kid like a little brother, and since he and my sister are the same age, they get along well and there's usually no problem- so long as our parents don't *dare* to go out and leave Alex with me to babysit.


Alex and his dad had a very close relationship and, generally speaking, I think they still do. However, Alex is undoubtedly spoiled. He gets everything he wants and then some, be it expensive hockey game tickets or a new cellphone/snowmobile/ipod/whatever and doesn't seem to understand (or care) when his dad says 'no' or 'I can't afford to do this for you right now.'

Micheal has another child from a previous relationship who is not in the picture because of some baby-momma drama bullshit. He is in no way an irresponsible dad, and wants to see his child, but baby momma isn't having it- so as a result, Micheal is paying 900+ dollars a month in child support, all without seeing his kid. Alex loves his half brother very much, and not getting to see him is tough on the kid. On top of that, Micheal and Alex spend a LOT of time at our house. Micheal and my mother spend a majority of their time together, and Alex is often spending the night here at my house rather than at his own. Often our parents go out to eat or to a bar and leave me to watch Alex. I have absolutely no problem with this-

Alex, however, throws the mother of all tantrums whenever Micheal and my mom try to go out and do something without him. Additionally, any time he doesn't get what he wants (i.e wanting to go to a $150 college hockey game tonight that he only just found out at the last minute was even a thing) he throws a screaming, crying, violent tantrum. 

These tantrums, understandably, put a strain on my mom and Micheal's ability to do anything they want to do. It also affects my mom's relationship with Alex, as he tends to show his more spoiled, needy side more often when he's here. 

During these temper tantrums, Alex will often text his grandmother (on his smartphone with expensive data plans and such) about how his dad 'is drinking and being violent towards him'. Which is not true. Yes, my mom and Micheal like to have a few too many when they're together. However, Micheal has NEVER laid a hand on that boy beyond holding onto his arms to keep from being hit while Alex has a tantrum. Alex's grandmother (Micheal's mother) doesn't seem to know  whether or not to believe Alex.

Alex has had everything practically spoon-fed to him his whole life. In school, his teacher accepts his terrible work and gives him decent grades despite Alex not understanding the curriculum and saying as much, because he's a hockey player and without good grades he will get kicked off the team. At home, he insists on always doing *something*, be it going to a hockey game or snowmobiling or ice fishing, and if he doesn't get to do what he wants to do he will pitch a fit and call his grandmother to complain. 

Tonight, Alex wanted to go to a hockey game at the university, despite not telling his dad about it until an hour before this game was supposed to start. These things are really expensive, and not only does Micheal not have the money for it- he didn't want to take Alex, at 8:00 pm, in the freezing cold, 45 minutes away to watch a hockey game so he could beg for things at concession and what-not. Can you blame him? So naturally Alex pitched a fit, and Micheal ended up taking him home early because of it.

I'm worried about the strain Alex is putting on our parents' relationship with his spoiled habits and tantrums. I love the kid and his dad, and they're like a part of the family. My mother and Micheal have been talking recently about moving in together- but this is something that Alex would **never** tolerate. Oh, the tantrums that would be thrown. How can we, as a family, work this out with as little issue as possible? I've tried talking to Alex in-depth about this, but he's eleven; so of course I got an eleven year old's answers, which aren't much help in resolving the issue. All I really got from that discussion with him is that he's upset about his dad spending so much time with my mom- from what I gathered, before our parents started seeing each other, Alex spent 24/7 with his dad and got to do whatever he wanted. Now, that isn't so much the case. However, Micheal still does everything he can to make his son happy, including hauling him all over creation to different hockey games and things like that so he can play. 

Overall, I don't know how to help Alex be happier in our family while not getting *everything* he fucking wants. I have a good relationship with the kid, and I want to help him, but I don't know how. Any tips or ideas would be greatly appreciated, reddit.

TL;DR mom's boyfriend's spoiled as fuck son is putting a strain on the whole family with his temper tantrums over not getting what he wants due to limited funds/wanting to do things besides what son wants to do. Need help mediating before things take a turn for the worst as our parents look into moving in together.

19436,Non-Romantic,2hcjt5,"My mom has a friend (let's call her Y) whose two daughters I grew up with (I was 6, eldest daughter was 5 and other was 2). Recently the restaurant I was working at closed so the friend pulled some strings and found me a job at a sushi restaurant chain, where her friend is the head server (aka hiring manager). I am REALLY grateful, but there are some issues:

* The job is an hour's bus ride away. I am due to get 3 hour shifts through the end of next week. So essentially I am spending almost the exact same amount of time traveling there as I am actually working. Yesterday I actually spent over two hours trying to get back to my house because of some issues with public transit, but that's not the restaurant's fault...but it's an added source of stress.

* I don't make tips while training - that's fine. But even after training, they split tips at the other servers' discretion - meaning if they think I'm not doing a good job, they'll split it 70/30 or 80/20. This wouldn't be an issue except for the next point:

* NOBODY there speaks fluent English. The manager, head server, the sushi chef, and the server who is training me are all Korean and speak pretty much only Korean. When the sushi chef began speaking to me in Korean, I quickly apologized and said my Korean wasn't very good. (I can understand a lot, but I can't speak it well.) He stared at me and asked very condescendingly, Why? Um, because I grew up here and live here? The kitchen guys all speak Spanish and very little English. So everyone has been very exclusionary towards me - I can HEAR them talking about me in Korean, they only speak to each other in Korean, they joke to each other and then face me deadpan and tell me to go clean the bathrooms. So I'm thinking that even if I train quickly and do really well, it's going to be a LONG ASS time before they start sharing tips fairly because I'm not really in with them. They're actually behaving really ... racist isn't the right word...maybe prejudiced? against me.

Help?

EDIT: I should explain that I am Korean by birth (adopted by a first gen Korean mom and American dad) so the language thing is even more of an issue because they view me as rejecting my own people. I have had Korean people ask my why my mother didn't raise me right (as in she didn't force me to speak Korean or make Korean friends, as I had no interest in it) and you better believe it got my hackles up.

19440,Non-Romantic,2wkh6m,"I have talked this over with my husband extensively but I'm hoping to get some other insight. 

Some backstory: I am adopted by aunt and uncle. My stepfather sexually assaulted me from when I was a toddler until I was 12 and when I told my birth mother about it, she kicked me out of the house. My aunt and uncle took me in and have been amazing. I have 3 other biological sisters as well.

So, yesterday I got a friend request notification from my biological brother. I don't even know how he found me, he didn't know my maiden name (it's hyphenated and weird) and he doesn't know that I am married, so he couldn't know my married name. I am hesitant to accept and go down that road with them again. Firstly because they are all still in contact with both my birth mother and my step father; they're all still very close and it really hurts. Secondly, I have a toddler that I also have to consider. I feel like my son should know his family and that he might resent me later when he finds out he has several aunt and uncles (and a grandmother) he never knew about. I know it's not entirely rational or even that it's going to happen but I'd rather have some amount of control over it now as opposed to when he's older. 

I guess what I'm mostly worried about is this somehow getting back to my birth mother and my son wanting a relationship with her, because she's technically his grandmother, which would lead to him wanting to hang out with her and my step father and I can't even handle thinking about that. Obviously that's not going to happen any time soon, as he can't even talk yet. 

Am I overreacting? Should I just accept it and see how it goes?
He's still young enough that I could decide to cut contact if it gets too uncomfortable and it wouldn't really impact him too much.

Her wolf percentage is somewhere around 45%, according to what he and the breeder have said. I think the maximum allowed by our state is around 20%. From what I understand that means things like standard vaccinations might not be effective on her. Putting my dogs, who were here first, at risk.

Theres also the problem where my roommate is a shitty pet owner. The puppy is kept in an enclosure thats about 10x10 for most of the day. He only walks her around the property because he's worried she'll escape if he gives her a real walk. She's never off leash outside of her enclosure. She needs to be socialized but so far he's only introduced her to me. She's terrified of everything. He doesn't work on training her at all, and that kills me because she's so smart and easy to teach. I've taught her sit, down, wait for a treat, and rollover with nearly no effort. Part of that was self defense...it only took a couple hours for me to get tired of being accidentally chewed on when I offered her a treat. And I'm not at all okay with animals who jump all over me.

I know my roommate really well. I know he doesn't have the skill set required to give this animal a good life. I know that even though there has never been a time in my life where I haven't had a dog I don't have the skill set either. She's a wolf. She's sweet and friendly like a dog but she's only a puppy now. I'm really worried about what her life and interactions with people are going to be like when she reaches maturity. And my roommate won't listen to me. He's convinced himself that he's too dominant of a personality for a regular dog.

I also have to take care of the puppy every weekend because he travels out of town for work every friday-monday. I didn't sign up for that and I'm really not okay with it. Taking care of my dogs is easy these days, I taught them how to behave. The new puppy still has to learn and even though shes smart its hard.

I live in a 3rd world country, in a house with 6 other people.  One of them is my uncle[42]. He's abusing my whole family and its only getting worse. He's been clinically depressed since his adolescence, so by our country's well thought of law we can't kick him out of the house. He's been to therapy and has attacked and changed many therapist, having them telling us he doesn't have a mental condition. He's just evil. Psychotherapy is not functional in my country and we have no money for anything that could help. Now he can't even get a therapist, no one wants to work with him.  Only other option trying to send him to a mental institution witch i tried convincing my parents to consider but they said those are too cruel, beat patients etc. And i can't build much of a case myself.

They are arguing for hours every day. He's regularly breaking things around the house. he threw a chair a couple times at my grandmother but he hasn't been too physical yet so when we called police he somehow they decided it's all good. But he has a really bad temper and his condition is worsening rapidly and it's pretty certain to me, unfortunately not to everyone else, that he is going to have a breakdown and probably knife someone, or everyone, in the house.

 As I'm typing this they are arguing right now, and I'm sitting here with my sister. She's 6, she's scared, she can't grow up like this. I can't sit here knowing that one day she might see her family killing each other. I've considered provoking him to physically hurt me and then calling the police, otherwise there wouldn't be anything they could arrest him for and it would only make things worse. I talked to my parents, they don't know what to do. Even if he doesn't hurt anyone I don't think my grandparents have long to live with this amount of stress every day considering they are over 70yo, my grandmother already has a hearth condition and I honestly didn't expect that she would last so long.

Recently within the last few weeks my father (who is VERY anti computer/games etc) has been becoming more confrontational about my use of the computer and times I play it at, and has decided to ban my use of it. 

Although it doesn't seem like a huge problem I am very passionate about a game called League of Legends, if you know the game I am currently Plat 3 and would like to play professionally if I become good enough (only considering if i DO become really good). 

However my dad is trying to strip my access from playing it even though I regularly play other sports, (boxing, basketball), Consistently average A's in my subjects and am not involved in any illicit activities, and devote less than 2 hours a day of time on my computer. Whenever i try to address the fact that I believe his banning of it is unfair he completely dismisses me. 

He seems to be doing this not because it is affecting my social, academic, physical, or mental well being but because he did not grow up with computers and dislikes them. How should I approach this topic with him, or try to change his mind?

19536,Non-Romantic,2kjck4,"My parents split up when I was in high school, and my mother was incredibly mean and cruel to my father the last few years of their marriage and it extended until after. I chose to live with my father, as he was my best friend. 

A few months before my 18th birthday, my father was diagnosed with HIV that quickly progressed into AIDS. I dropped out of school and quit my job to care for my father full time as he was incredibly sick.  When my mother found out her diagnosis, she became incredibly mad even though they hadn't had sex in very many years and there was no way he could have passed it on to her. She texted him multiple times saying how she hoped he died from his illness and that he was terrible and she was going to die because of him. The last time she went off on him like this was a week before he died.


I'll spare a lot of the drama that happened after he passed away. Basically as soon as he died she started making it all about her and how she loved him so much and they were best friends. Okay lady. 

I was given his urn. My mom has thrown a huge fit about this for the last two years about how she should have it. I have literally nothing of my fathers except for a SF giants hoodie of his and his cat. My mother raided his apartment after she heard of the news and took everything else, even though a lot of the things were promised to me in his will. The will wasn't one made official by a lawyer, just one he wrote after he was diagnosed.  Some of the things are very expensive,  players rookie baseball cards, and a lot of rookie Michael Jordan merchandise he wanted me to sell after he gets inducted into the hall of fame to help pay for my college bills. Also, while raiding the house she took a note my father left for me on the door of our apartment reminding me to take my keys and wallet when I left and that he loved me. I often forgot and he put it up while on a business trip. I was planning on getting the I love you part tattooed. She reassured me she'd keep it safe for me. Hasn't been seen since. I was in such shock after he died that I didn't know any better. 

So I really do not want to give her his urn. I understand they were together for a while and he was important to her. But they were not close whatsoever in the years before and after his death and its insulting enough she's acting any different.  I was the one caring for my father while she was trying to bring him down. I was the one who was there with him when he died. She already has a new husband, he was my only father I will ever have. 

So basically,  what do I do about all this? My mom is very selfish and manipulative and enabled by her husband and my grandparents.  I don't know how to have an adult discussion about this. She brings it up almost every time we talk. Fortunately I now live two states away so I don't see her stealing it from me or something.

19538,Non-Romantic,2q1vff,"So as winter break nears it end, I am left with the decision of what to do with my roommate Mary. I will try to list my problems in a concise manner, though I don't know what to do as the problems feel very complex to me.

*I feel like Mary misrepresented herself on the roommate questionnaire. She said she was neat and went to bed at 10. I was fine with this, told her I went to bed at twelve and was disorganized but clean.

*Mary gets to school and stays out until two, three, even four in the morning and waking me up/disturbing my sleep in the process. I have the smaller side closest to the door. She has stopped this, but comes in at twelve or one, turning on all the lights and TV right before I'm about to sleep.

*Mary and I both have a lot of medical issues. I believe she is mildly autistic, but did not outright tell me this-only via her many symptoms/ticks (which she was very upfront about.) This includes shutting down in the face of too much stimuli. I feel like she often uses this sensory disorder as an excuse to get what she wants. 

*I have General Anxiety Disorder with a Hyperchondria subset. No one outside my close family knows this. Mary is very, very, messy. I would ask her to clean-she said she would yet her hairs Are EVERYWHERE. I do not believe she would clean. I would leave notes on her laptop when I would leave back home every weekend to clean and nada. I ended up cleaning the room the entire semester after the first week.

*Before we moved in I said I wouldn't mind to be on the side closer to the window. It turns out the room is divided by a small wall unevenly and I got the smaller side by quite a bit. Also, during move in she tried to move some things that inconvenienced me and my smaller side by quite a bit. I protested and her father agreed with me that it wasn't comfortable for me.

**The main issue.**


Mary has the side with the only heat vent and the wall blocks almost all of the heat. She also is hot all the time. She has the airconditioning on when it is 30 degrees outside. I am freezing to death. I have Asthma and the cold tends to make it worse. I realize to get my side barely warm, the other side must be cooking. Also, the vent falls right on her bed. I suggested that I switch to the bigger side for the winter months. She balked. She said no,no no! I will make it warmer.

This is frustrating because she is super hard to communicate with. Besides her being gone all the time, she is hard to talk to. She has walked away while I was talking to her. This is why I left the notes even though it is super passive aggressive. My mom suggested that she talk to the father as he was so much more reasonable during move in than Mary. 


I did talk to the RA. I could switch, but what if I got someone worse? You are only allowed to move out if you have a serious medical conditions that prevent you from living with another person. I think my hypochondria counts but I would have to disclose it. My scholarships would be cut if I moved out to the tune of 6000 a year. With the subtraction of the price of the dorm, apartment would be $1000 more cost total.

 She doesn't even use all of the space of her bigger side, all of her things would fit fine in my side. I think it would be more fair if we switched sides for two months (she would still be there the majority of the time for a total of four months.)

**Questions: Am I over reacting and making these problems seem bigger than they really are? Should my mom talk to Mary's father about switching sides?**

* This girl frequently invites her siblings to sleep in our house and they are very noisy. The house is not THAT big.
* This girl shows ungratefulness and disrespect to my father. My father takes care of their baby but I often hear her whining rudely about what my father forgot to do (e.g. wash bottles) instead of thanking him for his efforts

I'm actually somewhat liberal, I married my husband who comes from a very conservative family.

Anyways, I love the hell out of my son, even though he hasn't always made it easy for me.  When he was a teenager he was the definitive rebel without a cause.  He would sneak girls into his room, drink, disappear for  substantial amounts of time, only responding when texted him that we would call the police if he didn't come home.

His senior year, he realized he wouldn't be able to play QB in college if he didn't shape up, and he really shaped up. He got good enough grades, and got a scholarship to play receiver oddly enough at the school in our town.  Unfortunately, he blew out his knee and had to stop playing.

I'm ecstatic about his girlfriend.  She's great; she's kind, beautiful, plus she's a fellow redhead.  I think she's a great match for my son because she's a bit more warm then my son, who now that he's getting older, is somewhat colder like my husband.  My son has said that he's going to propose to her sometime in 2015, that they had talked about it, and that she would (most likely) say yes.

At the start of this summer, my brother in law started hosting a weekly barbecue, which has gone on to this point, and is planned to continue until the end of time.  There's probably around thirty people that attend regularly.  My son and his girlfriend usually come every weekend.

We live in a southern state, It's always very humid and very hot, so she'll usually wear a spaghetti strap top and some shorts, or sometimes slightly more revealing clothing.  She also doesn't really dress up.  I think the time that caused the most fuss was when she wore one of my son's shirts and some shorts that weren't visible because of his shirt.  Anyways, there's a couple of things going on that aren't good:

1)I feel like the men stare at her a lot, the teenagers glance at her as much as possible, and the Pabst crew (older men from 25 to 35) literally stand in the corner of the yard and stare at her.  I've heard them make jokes about looking forward to the view.

2) Some of the women are starting to disrespect her, it's almost treated like a weekly thing where they wonder what she'll wear this time.

She's also very affectionate with my son, she'll plop down on his lap or give him a kiss every once in a while, and it makes some of the older people a little uncomfortable (which is more understandable to me).

I think these people are going to be her family one day, and I don't want them looking down on her.  She and my son are normally caught up in each other, so I really doubt that they'd notice these kind of things.

Should I talk to her or my son about this?  I know it’s october, but there’s plans for a bonfire for the Winter, and it might be pretty warm and muggy a few more times this year.

My parents have been married for 35 years and met at a very young age. They've been very much in love the entire time, and still love each other now but it has all gone sour with how my Dad is acting.

My mum is an EA for a large corporation (kind of like a high ranking personal assistant with more responsibilities). Her boss is very wealthy and a very kind man. Because my Mum has to put up with his shit quite a lot, he takes her out for dinners, theatre trips, lunch, etc. They have become quite good friends as they have similar interests such as the cinema and opera, which my Dad doesn't have an interest in. About 4 months ago my Mum's boss sent her a text with some explicit detail because he was drunk and essentially described how he felt about her and how 'happy' she made him feel. My Dad had been reading her texts and obviously flipped out. My mum immediately straightened things out, reminded her boss of his place and made it clear she had not provoked this nor had any intention of acting upon it. Since then my Dad has changed.

Dad reads her texts, copies them onto his iPad, he wants to know where she is going and when and why and who with. He initially didn't want Mum to see her boss outside work but relented when my Mum explained they are great friends and he just messed up. Her boss apologised profusely, explained how he was drunk and caught in the moment on the way back from a dinner with Mum. **Mum would never cheat on Dad, it's not in her nature.** Her boss is well known for being a lovely, generous man and he's even best friends with his ex girlfriend - they go on holidays together even though she has a husband because everyone knows they are just friends. (Please stop thinking the worst here, it is actually possible for two people to not have sex and an affair when they have partners).

My Mum can't go into the city without my Dad 'suggesting' he go with her and finding an excuse to do so. He accused her of 'meeting someone' when she curled her hair one morning. It's argument after argument. He asks her about her boss every day out of the blue. 'Have you spoken to ____ today?', 'How is ____ today?'. Then he goes as far as to say 'What happens if we split up?' 'Where will you live?' and then starts looking on the internet at rent prices and hotel costs, telling my mum what he could do and acting as if he's organising what we are having for dinner rather than the logistics of their split. It's just fucking weird.

I met my Mum yesterday for a girly day out shopping and going to a gallery and all day he was ringing us wanting to know where we were and what we were doing. We'd already had to force him not to join us previously. He left me 6 calls, 10 texts and 2 voicemails in 30 minutes because he was 'lonely'. We were only gone for the day. Then he accused Mum of meeting someone, of drinking and slurring her texts, of me covering up for her. He has turned into a monster and I'm scared I'm going to stop liking him.

He's my Dad and I love him but he's gone mad. He is accusing my Mum and I of arranging things, he wants to be there with everything we do together. My Mum is going to go to adult ballet again to keep up her fitness and my Dad wants to join in. He wants to watch her to make sure she's there. He's obsessed and possessive over her, suffocating her as if he has a right to know her every movement like a prisoner. He won't listen to me and gets angry if I say anything. He's making things difficult at Uni because I'm constantly thinking about them and whether I'll get support in my last year of uni and if I'll have a home to come back to. It's even making me analyse my own relationship because I'm scared my SO will be the same. That's not right at all.

The only thing I want to do right now is tell him exactly what he's doing and how fucked up it is and how if he doesn't stop, he's going to lose me and Mum. I can't stand by and watch him do this to all of us and himself. 

I almost want them to split to save us but they are both meant to be retiring in 5 months and moving to France to live in a house they own. He needs therapy or something. I don't know, I'm just stressed and upset. What do I do?

tl;dr Dad is jealous of my Mum doing anything without him. Accuses her of meeting people and drinking and cheating. He watches her every move but denies it all. He accuses me of covering up for her and is not the man I used to know and it's ruining me and my studies.

To start, this girl and I met each other through work a few months ago and dated for a couple months. It obviously wasn't going to work out mostly due to where we are in our different stages of life, but also the fact that she had an in and out ex thing going on for years that she told me about near the end. Whatever, I've been in that situation and I knew we weren't going to work out as a couple so it didn't bother me. I understood.

I had no previous ties with her, being as we weren't friends before we dated, so I was all about to just let her go out of my life entirely. Out of the blue, a few days after we parted ways, she texts me. I talk to her and this is mostly just nonsense. She eventually says she wants to remain friends, likes talking to me, all that. I've also been in that situation as I am very close friends with someone I have known for 11 years and dated for 4 in the middle of that, even lived together. So, this didn't bother me.

Over the course of the months after that it had become apparent that she was not interested in being friends, getting together, or even holding meaningful conversations.

I want to put it down that I have no romantic interest, or physical attraction, in this girl anymore, because I don't want the next parts to get construed that way. I'm not chasing her like a guy in love who got dumped. I'm just and overly trusting guy that gives too many chances to people that don't deserve them. To say that I just don't pick up on signals, like she keeps ditching you take a hint, is a way of describing this that I don't feel quite fits the situation, but you readers be the judge.

After a few weeks have past since we stopped seeing each other romantically, I eventually start to invite her to do things with me during our continued conversations. Not specific events that I plan for her and I, but rather I'm inviting her to do things that I am going to do whether she comes or not.

The first time she accepts. Then texts me she can't make it the day of. Cool. No problem for me.

The second time, a couple weeks later, she accepts. The day of she ignores my text. No word from her until I see her around work (it's a big place and we don't run into each other much) and she apologizes. I tell her it's no big deal I still went.

Now at this point I've stopped inviting her to do things because it's obvious to me that she doesn't want to do anything with me. I even stop texting her as often as it really just seems to me this girl just wants some hollow attention that it provides. These things are no big deal to me as I was content with never talking to her again from the get go.

We still text occasionally, and see each other at work. She calls us friends or me a friend often.

One day she sees me wearing the cheapest fitbit that they make and asks what it was. I tell her and she thinks it's cool and wants one. I told her that it kind of sucks and is wildly inaccurate but I wouldn't mind setting it up for her to try. She agrees.

I never went out of my way to give it to her nor did she to get it. A couple weeks pass by and she seems thoroughly uninterested at this point when I bring it up. It just sits in my car.

Some time later her car breaks down and she needed a ride to work. She asks me if I can do it and I say that I can because I just feel bad for her being broke with no car. So as I'm dropping her off and she's stepping out of the car I remember the fitbit is still sitting my glove box. Without thinking I say Hey, did you still want to borrow this? She looks at it for a second, which I thought was odd, then says yeah ok.

Immediately when she closes the door I feel in my gut it was bad idea. Things after that continue on as they were with how we were talking.

I never invite her to do anything, but instead she somehow finds a way to invite herself but then bails? In a general example of how many encounters have gone: We will run into each other at work as I'm leaving at night and she's coming in. We'll small talk for a while and she'll ask me what I'm doing on the weekend. I tell her I'm going to go to this and that and she'll get super excited and say she's been wanting to do that and she has the day off so she'll sometimes invite herself. Other times she'll really hint at me inviting her until I do. When that happens I tell her I'm leaving at noon and I'll text her at 11am to check and see if she still want to come. She never texts me back those days. She never texts when she invites herself and then doesn't show.

This happened so much because it became amusing to me. I really wanted to see how long she could keep doing the same thing over and over. There was even another woman that we both talk to at work that started complaining to me one day about how this girl kept saying she was going to come to her house then ignore's her until it's either too late to reasonably go to someone's house at night, or just the next day entirely. I kept my feelings about the subject to myself, but I was laughing on the inside having just found out that this is happening to other people and not just me.

I don't understand that move at all. I feel like she is trying to make me feel bad or something along those lines. Maybe she thinks I'm still into her and this is playing to her attention grabbing? Maybe she needs to have the that feeling of being able to ignore someone when they're attempting to contact her? I really don't know. With knowing she does it to other people, maybe she really is just that shitty.

Fast forward a month and we rarely talk now, if you could call it that. I forgot about the fitbit and she hasn't ever asked me how to set it up to be able to see anything she does with it. So I know she's not using it. I text her like nothing is wrong and I ask for it back saying I wanted to start using it again. She says she will get it to me asap.

I forget about it again. Two more weeks go by and I have to ask again. She promises she was going to bring it to me at work the next day. The next day comes and she texts me some excuse about how she didn't bring it when she left the house and she can't go back home before work (she works at night now). I say that's fine just to try and get it back to me asap.

It has now been another week and a half. I think at this point I'm just salty and confused. I should really just let her keep the thing and cut all contact. If she even still has it. She could have lost, sold, or broke it by now I don't know. She is broke and a severe pothead (nothing wrong with being a pothead imo, just throwing that out there because of this situation). I could go buy another one if I wanted, but I don't even really want to use it nor do I care that it cost me 100 dollars. If it broke I wouldn't replace it. It just upsets me that I was dumb enough to give it to her and THAT'S the reason I'm out 100 dollars and am still talking to this person. Another reason that I'm holding out, pestering her to get it back, is that I'm 30 years old and have had two LTRs (4 years and 3 years) with a peppering of girls in between and this is the first shitty woman I've ever had dealings with. I know saying that on this sub kind of says that it's not that shitty in comparison, but damn from my perspective it's very annoying.

I have a history of depression and mental illness that I keep hidden from the world. It comes in waves. My father is always very supportive because he knows how capable and how much I fight against my brain's chemistry. 

We got into an argument yesterday over the future of the company and how it was run. The argument escalated and he began to call me all sorts of names and I was just like wow, you're pathetic etc etc while he called me a piece of shit and a scumbag. The whole argument is a blur but what caught me by surprise is when he told me to kill myself. Now mind you he knows that I have suicidal ideation and the only thing keeping me alive is my friends, my family, my girlfriend, soccer, and tennis. That comment caught me off guard and I was like wait what really? and he said it again. He was so angry he was like spitting.

little back story: i was raised an only child by a single mother. our relationship is very close, symbiotic if you will. we've had our ups and downs but have never been to the point of not speaking, even through my own struggles with failed relationships and drug addiction. i'm now happily married, and our relationship is wonderful, she loves my husband and is very happy for me. we talk almost every day, and despite being about 30 minutes apart we see each other every couple weeks for lunch or dinner. she lives alone, well, she has a ton of pets, which she's always had since i was a kid, they keep her company, and keep her young, even though she's pushing 70 :)
 
So, I have an older sister that my mom gave up for adoption when my mom was 21. my mom told me about her when i turned 18, and said that if i wanted to i could look for her. i found her about 6 years ago. my mom was sooo happy when we found her, and things were great for a long time! we hung out, went to the zoo, she’d come to family stuff, it was great. It was like no time had passed, we immediately absorbed her into our family as one of our own. When I met her, she was married to a great guy, the father of her youngest son. her husband and mine immediately hit it off, they all fit with us like a glove. It was great.

 
Well last year, she told me her and her husband were getting a divorce, that it was amiable on both sides, they had just grown apart and since their son was an adult now decided to go their separate ways. Her husband isn’t a religious person at all. She is a “traditional witch” which is NOT wiccan as she explained to me lol and she has a coven, they do rituals on the solstices and stuff. ok cool, it’s your faith or belief, totally dig it, right on. well, one of the people in her coven is a guy named Puff (why “Puff” I don’t know, he is not magical nor a dragon). 

 
First time I met him he was cool, my sister jokingly called him her second husband/coven husband, whatever. Well, last year, my husband and i decided to host easter with my mom and my sister, her husband and son at our place. it ended up that her husband and son were going to his family as my sister was going to ritual the night before, but it was over on our side of town (she lives about an hour north of us, ritual is about 20 minutes west of us) our place is on her way home, but she was driving with puff. So we invited her and puff to our home to celebrate, which consisted of my husband smoking ribs (which were freakin amazing omg I want some right now). 

I also wanted to share with my sister a tradition of mine and my mom’s that we’ve had since I was little, which is watching Jesus Christ Superstar. I’m not a religious person, but I was raised catholic and that is my mom’s faith which she’s never forced on anyone that I’ve ever seen, but the movie isn’t even THAT religious, and actually a lot of Christians don’t care for the way christ is depicted in the movie….ANYWHO puff proceeds to go on a rant about religion and how inaccurate the movie is (which it’s not really supposed to be, it’s a freakin musical, come on) and in my opinion, and and my husband's and as I later learned, my mother’s as well, was very rude and disrespectful the entire time. but we bit our tongues and tried to enjoy the holiday anyway.
 
Didn’t see puff again, and still haven’t. after my sister told me about the divorce, she said she was just staying with puff, he had recently lost his mother and she was helping him out around his place while he had to make frequent trips down south. After this, this is when I noticed the big change. My mom would text or call her and leave messages, and not get a response for days and weeks at a time, to the point where mom would ask me to call or text her, I would and would also get no response. when we would hear from her, she’d apologize and just say she’d been busy. I understand that, I get like that too. you mean to call someone and then it’s suddenly a month later, time gets away from you, it sucks! So I let it go. 

then we’d invite her to shows, or to family gatherings, in particular our anniversary party last year which I was really hoping she’d make it to, but she didn’t make any effort or apology for missing things. We invited her to Christmas with my mom’s fam this past year, she was going to come but then ended up doing something with puff instead. again...I let it go.
 
Valentine's weekend was my mom’s birthday. our original plan was to go to a classic theater in the city and see Casablanca because they were playing it for free for valentine’s day. but I saw my sister's soon to be ex husband post on his facebook that my nephew was playing his first show with his band the same night we were going to go to the movie. I asked mom if she’d rather go to his show, she was totally all about it. find out it’s all ages and is an early show starting at 4pm and his band is playing first. so my mom gets a call from my sister (after we made these plans) telling her about the show and she finds out we already know, no big, cool, she calls me and we make plans to meet for a late lunch/early dinner before the show, then head to the venue. Mom is indecisive about where she’d like to have dinner, so we decided to just meet at the venue and decide there. 

The day of, my sister is texting me wanting to change plans, wanting to do dinner after. mind you, I’m driving from my house to pick up mom in redford (about 25 minute drive) and heading out to where the gig is, which is about an hour from mom’s house. (just to note, the old theater we were originally going to go to is about 5 minutes from mom’s house, but I digress) I tell my sister that mom would prefer to not be out too late and would like an early dinner. We made these plans a week prior, and now suddenly she has other things she has to do . I try to accommodate, I try to rearrange the time frames. We call her when we get close to the venue, she is no where close to being ready, so we go to eat without her. We finish and get back to the venue about 2:45pm, PLENTY of time, we get a great seat at the bar and wait for her and her soon to be ex hubby to come. Puff is not coming (thank god) because he didn’t want it to be awkward, classiest thing I’ve ever known the guy to do. 


anyway, ex hubby gets there around 3:30pm, he has our tickets (even though we’re already inside) and we chat and catch up. my sister, who was worried to miss my nephew playing first at 4, doesn’t get to the club until 4:45pm as my nephew finds out that he’s actually not playing until 7:30 (this is an entirely different set of shenanigans, the booking agent at this club is the worst kind, nobody knew what time they were playing until 3:30 the same day. retarded) me and mom are totally bummed, we’ve already been there for 2 hours, and I’m not feeling too hot (i had JUST the day before gotten a positive pregnancy test, was feeling a bit sick after our greasy burgers at dinner. i spilled the beans to my mom, kind of for her birthday, and she was thrilled) and mom wasn’t either, so we apologized and headed home. my sister didn’t say anything about being upset we were leaving. her ex wasn’t either, my nephew is 19 and I’m sure didn’t care that his aunt and grandma were leaving lol but it was good to see everyone and fun for a bit, we just couldn’t hang that late and with the set changes it could have ended up they could have gone on even later with the way that show was being run. 
 
Our ride home was the best part of the whole day, we blasted AC/DC and Billy Idol and sang along together in the car. It was fantastic. When I dropped her off, she said it was the best birthday ever :D
 
So…..Monday I get a text from my sister, it’s a pic of my nephew drumming and says “just a little bit of what you guys missed” I replied with “I’m sure he kicked ass, we’ll try to make the next show” to which she responds: yea, well, it won’t be his very 1st gig ever again. not real happy with you or mom right now.
 
I’m instantly livid, I’m shaking I’m so upset. After months of being blown off, of not showing up to family stuff, of making plans and breaking them, really??!?! I call mom, repeatedly. She was on the phone with my sister at the time, when I finally got a hold of her I was so angry I could have puked, she would not speak to me while I was that upset. So I finally replied to my sister's text with “I’m sorry you feel that way, and if talking to mom didn’t do anything I don’t have anything else to say right now” I decided to put my phone away, I was done for the night, I could hardly eat I was so disgusted with how she was being, when I went to bed I saw I had a text but I didn’t read it. 

this was soooo not like her! She’s always been very laid back, very “it is what it is” very zen, this is totally out of left field. I don’t even realize until the next day why I’m so angry. It’s not because she hurt my feelings, it because she was hurting my mom. And when I realize this I’m even more livid. Tuesday morning, I look at the text she sent before I leave for work “well you have my number when you do. I guess blood doesn’t really make a difference when it comes to support. That’s fine, I see where we fit now” I could have punched through my dash board, I spent the entire day furious and nauseated by her. 
 
I decide to text her soon to be ex, he works nights and I asked him when would be a good time to talk. He says he’ll give me a call around 7 that night. this makes me feel a bit better, and when I get to talk to him he says that after we left my sister was bummed and tried to get him to side with her about us leaving. But he said he totally understood, the point was that we showed up, and he was happy to see us. He said that all her friends she’s had for years have noticed this change in her, because of puff. We have a great talk, I told him we’ll just keep him instead lol and he told me to tell my mom he loves her and loves me too. 
 
So I call my mom now, and she’s glad that I spoke to him because she wanted to call him too but didn’t know what kind of hours he worked. Now that I wasn’t blind with fury, she told me about her conversation with my sister the night before. Apparently all she did was ream her for 20 minutes, the entire time my mom heard puff in the background feeding her what to say, using amy nephew as a weapon to hurt her and make her feel bad. this is the last straw, I tell her I will not tolerate someone hurting my mom. She doesn’t deserve a mom as great as mine if this is how she’s going to treat her. I haven’t responded to her, and I won’t. as much as I want to (and and my husband too, he wants to call her and tell her off and make her cry because she made me cry lol I love him) I’m going to let it be. Hoping she gets her head out of her ass someday, but right now she’s being controlled or manipulated by this guy who, according to her ex, has been alienating all of her friends that she’s had for decades. He also said that my nephew wasn't the least phased by us leaving, and just said it was cool that we came. which, if anyone's opinion mattered in all of this, it's my nephew's, in my opinion.

last week, my mom decided to send my send my sister a text, just saying i love you and i'm thinking of you and hope you are getting over being upset with us to which she responded (after copying the texts between her and i) It's not someting i felt i needed to get over. it wasn't a small child's temper tantrum. both of you really hurt my feelings and the worst part is that neither of you understand why and don't think i have the reason to be upset. i still love you and her, i put the responsibility of future contact and mending things on you both, up to you and her. love you still.


i was naively hoping that after some time passed, she would see the error of her explosion, but no. i'm still refusing to speak to her. she will only find out about my pregnancy through facebook, i will not call her to tell her personally. 


**edit: didn't make it into the copy and paste**
i am not religious, but i don't see how the universe could bring us all together only to have this happen. i feel like her new boyfriend is alienating her from us on purpose and from everyone else that cares about her. neither me nor my mom have judged or been anything but supportive of her divorce, we just want her to be happy. i don't know how to move forward, if at all. i don't want to speak to her, mostly because at this point i will only make things worse because i'm still furious (and full of pregnancy rage) so i'm letting my mom take the wheel on this for the time being.

My roommate Jack is perpetually unemployed and barely makes rent each month. We live with several other people and are all in the film/TV industry, which is very freelance. However, while the rest of us seem to find work most of the time, he is very frequently unemployed. A coworker of mine, Fred (60's), has a friend Jane (60's) who wanted something filmed for her and came to me asking if I know anyone. Since I know Jack films stuff pretty well (and because I wanted to help him out and make sure he pays rent) I recommended him to Jane. I've worked with Jack before and he has been fine, a bit lazy, but knows what he's doing. They worked something out, neither I nor Fred were involved at all. I asked Jack several times how it was going, he always told me it was fine.

Fast forward to this afternoon, over a month after filming/finishing the project. My coworker Fred calls me into his room, very upset, and proceeds to tell me what happened. He just received an email from his friend Jane that told him of how during the filming, a light fell on her head and gave her a concussion. My roommate Jack had hired another guy to help with lighting (he had set up that light) and that guy was smoking weed on set. They didn't do much to help her and just continued filming.

Since then, she has been in and out of doctor's offices because she has had awful headaches and ear pain from the light breaking apart on the table after it hit her head. On top of this, Jack demanded more money from her than they agreed on, since he claimed she asked him to do more work than he agreed to. It sounds like he did everything very shoddily and she just agreed to it, because she is scared that he will, out of vengeance, post the outtakes/bad footage online. And as an actress, she doesn't want anything bad about her out on the internet. That is also why she doesn't want to pursue legal action, which I immediately said would be the best option. I have no loyalties to this guy anymore.

I was incredibly upset when I heard this because 1. she got hurt 2. I recommended him through one of my own coworkers 3. He never mentioned ANY of this to me before, either he doesn't care or was hiding it from me.

Now, my coworker Fred doesn't blame me or anything and I apologized of course and talked it over with him. But he asked me to talk to my roommate and see what he says/offers/etc. I am so incredibly angry at Jack and felt so awful and in shock to be hearing this from my coworker who trusted me to recommend someone to him.

Reddit, my question to you is, how the fuck do I approach this conversation tonight? For all intents and purposes, I am an outsider here and even though no blame is being put on me, I want to make it right. I feel absolutely horrible about what happened and am furious at my roommate for being so unprofessional, putting my recommendation on the line, and for not saying anything earlier.

1. What do I say to him?
2. What can I reasonably expect to come out of this? What should I ask of him to best resolve this with Jane? 
3. Can I actually do anything?
4. Should I involve my roommates?

Any and all advice welcomed and appreciated. Let's see how the talk goes tonight...

19637,Non-Romantic,3bicdo,"I'm a junior in college, and met my friend Jenny through my girlfriend. We've only been hanging out for about 2 months, since my girlfriend has moved into my place. Jenny is a nice girl and used to be fun to hang out with, but recently has become very open about her depression, romantic problems, and other issues. Within the past month, Jenny has been texting and calling me about her problems, sometimes on the verge of tears.  

Last night, we were all hanging out in my TV room, and my gf had to go to the store quickly. Jenny and I were going to play a game, but she almost immediately started crying and talking about her past breakup with me. I mostly just consoled her and tried to lighten the mood/change the subject, but she lifted lifted her sleeve and started to show me cutting scars on her shoulders. I was extremely uncomfortable and tried to react as tactfully as I could, but I really had no idea what to do/say in that situation. She started to calm down and we played a few games, and was completely fine when my girlfriend came home.

I've asked my girlfriend what's been going on with her, but apparently she's never heard any of this sort of talk from her. She thinks she's opening up to me because I'm so easy to talk to, but it's honestly just making me uncomfortable. I've been under a lot of stress, lately, and have been struggling with depression as well. I don't feel comfortable with everything that she's telling me, because I feel like I have enough to deal with as it is, as shitty as that sounds.

19649,Non-Romantic,26apmv,"Some back story:

I recently got out of a five year relationship 2 months ago and soon after I started a FWB relationship with one of my good friends that I've known for 3 years. When we started hooking up, I knew he was seeing someone what I thought was casually. He never mentioned her, and when he did, he was always complaining about how clingy she was and that he wanted to end whatever they had going on, so I had no qualms about going ahead with being FWB. Apparently, they weren’t just casual, and she ended up moving to our city for a couple of months. As I’m not for cheating, we have stopped all sexual activity.


While we were hooking up I kind of felt like he was getting feelings for me – he told me I was ‘absolutely beautiful’ among other really sweet things, he wanted to cuddle and talk the whole night, he told me he got jealous of an instance when I was flirting with another guy and admitted he shouldn't have been, and he even took me out dancing which I thought was quite a public display - especially if he is seeing someone. 


I’m just really confused by the situation that is going on now. Now that we’ve ended our FWB, he wants to hang out with me more than ever, and seems to want to spend more time with me than her. He keeps texting me about how ‘bored’ he is when I know he is with her watching a movie or whatever, and asks me what I’m doing and that he wants to hang out. He purposely omits bringing her up in conversation with me, and only tells me if she is over at his house after I agree to come over (she is really nice and I would consider her a friend now, so I don’t mind hanging out with her). Yesterday when we were all casually drinking at his house, he was like “I haven’t hung out with you in forever!” in front of her, even though I had seen him 3 days in a row for at least 2 hours.


He likes to run from his problems, so I’m not sure if he is trying to use me as a crutch because he doesn’t have the balls to break it off with her or what. Ultimately, I’m wondering how or if I should bring up the situation that is going on now with him, because I find it weird that he is acting like this. I consider him one of my best friends now more than ever, and I wouldn’t want to ruin it - but admittedly I would jump at the chance to continue the FWB if that became an option again, which he knows.


TL;DR; I started hooking up with a friend, we stopped because the girl he was seeing moved here, now he wants to spend all his time with me. Not sure how/if I should bring up this current situation with him.

19650,Non-Romantic,1y9cmw,"My parents divorced when I was 8. My mom got custody of my sisters and I and my dad got us every weekend. We were with him every weekend until we got older and into High School where weekends turned into hanging out with friends, and I only saw my dad occasionally. (I would like to mention that my dad makes good money and is there for us financially 100%, 100% of the time).

I found out my dad cheated on my mom when I was 12 (I found out when I read my older sister's diary - ha) and was hurled into a world of shock and sadness. How could he do this to my mom and my sisters no less? To all of us? I resented him, I decided even though I loved him that I didn't like him, and just was really hurt in general. As High School days got more frequent, seeing my dad became less frequent. Calls were less, and I remember one time he didn't answer my phone calls or texts for an entire month. His lack of interest in me began to hurt a lot. I hate to cry and talk about my feelings, but my mom and friends could tell sometimes when I was sad. For a long time they tried to get me to talk about whatever was bothering me but I wouldn't. My mom knew it must have something to do with my dad, and when she pushed too hard I would burst into a sobbing mess, not know what to say and go to my room and wait till I stopped crying.

I craved being close with him, but we rarely saw him now. I wished he would tell me he loved me when I got off the phone with him when I told him it, but he didn't (only sometimes). I wished he wouldn't ignore my phone calls and texts. I wished he liked me. I wish he tried harder with me. I eventually felt like I didn't know what to say to him when I would see him, so I made sure my sisters were around so that an awkward silence didn't occur. To think that we would sit next to each other in silence and not know what to say broke my heart and I couldn't stand the thought of crying about it. 

My mom, dad and sisters moved me into my first day of college. When I was settled, we all said our goodbyes. When it was my dads turn, I expected to get the little side hug that I normally get from him. Instead, he pulled me into him and squeezed me into the tightest hug. Into this secure, tight squeeze I felt love pouring out of him and I was so shocked and the hug felt so good that I had to clench my throat hard to not burst into tears. He surprised me even more when he didn't let go for about 10 seconds. And when he finally let go and I looked at him I saw that his EYES WERE WATERY!!! I couldn't believe it. I choked out a final goodbye to everyone as they got in the car and right as they drove away I burst into tears and cried for like 10 minutes. He loves me. He loves me. He really loves me. My heart felt amazing. It didn't hurt. He really loved me. I looked forward to those hugs ever since.


I have since gotten a bit closer to my dad (like as of a year ago), and I don't feel like he doesn't like me anymore, but he is still not affectionate, and it still sometimes makes me sad. He didn't get me anything for Valentine's day nor did he contact me. My friend's dads got them all flowers. So my feelings are kind of newly hurt. Any advice on how to be strong and endure his lack of affection? I think that it hurts my view on men in general also. I always get frightened thinking that any guy I ever date or talk to maybe doesn't really like me.

19652,Non-Romantic,2gacsh,"im sorry, i should have made this thread... a long time ago. anyway, i dont know how much time i have so im gonna be as curt as i can. i only found out a few months ago that my friend in question, who we'll call david for the sake of anonymity, had been suffering from depression for a good 6 years. he's never talked to anyone about it, and its gotten really bad because of this. he's a really good friend of mine, i met him over tumblr well over a year ago now and i owe things like being able to cut off toxic people out my life and going to the gym to him. but he's... unique in how he thinks, he's very logic driven, thinking about many scenarios to any presented situation. he's literally told me about how his head would occasionally burn up when it got really bad, but anyway. david would sometimes tell me about how he was a strong believer in the concept of true love, how having someone who meant the world and back to you was enough to keep him going through everything. 

he had this with his current girlfriend, who we'll call emma who's 19. emma lives in the us, while he lives in portugal, so obviously there's some complications with just timezones. i knew them both, but never dug into their relationship much. i did know they'd been going for a good few months and were very close. there was a good period of time where i only spoke to david simply because emma had a habit of being notoriously hard to reach (i should mention i live in the UK). i dont know the details exactly, but things with emma and david got really strained. i know emma had been dealing with a lot in her personal life, more then some people do in their whole lives. eventually this became too much for her and she ended up running away for over a week. she got really far, but thankfully had taken her laptop, and david was eventually able to get her to turn herself in.

things didnt stop there though, their relationship took a pretty heavy toll for reasons i still dont really know and long story short, it's pretty much over. normally i wouldnt have really cared about all this at all, but now david has nothing to stop him from ending his life. what's worse, his previous ex, who knew of his condition, has told his family, who are apparently likely to react by locking him in asylum. i have his address, i got it from emma, who also knows how he may act. i dont know if i can call the police though, or even how to. but even i did, he told me once in the event his family were alerted to his condition, he would take the knife he carries at all times and end it right there and then.

as of right now, he just told me he had some things to do, and he probably wouldnt be back again. we said goodbye, and at this point i think ive lost any chance to to talk to him about it. though the hours i spent trying to convince him to see someone didnt do for much good. he's too damn stubborn.

 so, that's where i have to come to you guys. id appreciate anything here, preferably just some advice on who i can contact to get in touch with him that wont result in him ending it. im sorry, im scared and i know this is desperate, but i have nowhere else to turn. if i dont try something, im never going to forgive myself. ive had to alter and omit a few things here and there, but if i need to clarify anything i will.

Karen: 22 F, bipolar, depression (my best friend)
Josh: 20 M

Karen met Josh online back in November on a dating site. She was already dating someone else for about a year but dumped him for Josh. Karen was living with her parents in Wisconsin, while Josh was in California. The other guy was devastated from the break up, she felt bad, but it wasn’t a big deal to her. She’s had tons of boyfriends and she wanted something new. From the start her relationship with Josh was very rushed. They said “I love you” after 5 days of Skyping back and forth. Keep in mind she is a very impulsive person and so is Josh. 

After 2 months of dating via Skype, Karen decides to move in with Josh without meeting him first. She gets on an airplane and doesn’t even say goodbye to me and has been in California with Josh since. After being together for a total of 4 months, Josh proposes to Karen. Karen said yes and was quick to post the photo of her ring online. Keep in mind that Karen’s other ex of 3 years is recently married, when they broke up she was completely devastated.  I think her rushing into marriage is because she wants her ex to think her life is amazing.

Here's another issue: Karen sits at home all day while Josh is at work and she’s told me that she’s depressed and misses home. When she contacts me, it’s only to complain about her life.  I love Karen, but I can’t help her unless she helps herself. She’s the kind of person that is very proud, and wouldn’t end the relationship because it’s not working-she would go down with the ship. She’s clearly unhappy but doesn’t want anyone to be able to say I told you so. From knowing Karen my whole life I can tell you that she wants to go home and probably break up with her now fiancé, but won’t because she’d have to admit she was wrong first. My question is, how do I get her to realize that she needs out of this situation?

Background: this roommate/best friend basically refuses to clean, throw away trash, his dog has attacked another dog in the house cause $600 vet bill, he offered to cover $100 because he blamed the other dog (tiny dog vs pit bull...), overall selfish human being who doesn't take care of his home, his dog, or his friends.

My girlfriend and I have been together for six months. Now before you go ahead and say anything, I know it is really early for us to be moving in. I am not planning on doing this tomorrow but I am thinking toward the future. I am more than willing to wait a few more months, even half a year if that makes sense but this is something I want to do.

Regardless of timeline, I see a future with this girl and she sees one with me. We have talked about our future and we are both on the same page. We have also talked about moving in together and we are also on the same page but also both willing to wait until it logistically makes sense. 

Now here is where the problem comes in. She rents an apartment by herself and I own a house where I rent out a room to a close  friend of mine. We both recognize that moving into my place is the logical thing to do and she is very much on board with doing that. However, she doesn't want to live here while my roommate is here. Perfectly understandable and I totally agree with her.

To give a little background on my friend. We have been friends since we were kids. We have lived together for 8 months and have had zero issues. Living with him has been great. I was reluctant at first because I thought that living together might cause problems but we haven't had a single issue. Him moving in was mutually beneficial. He was living with his parents and wanted to get out of their house and I needed extra money at the time. I gave him a really good deal on rent but it helped me out a lot. So it worked out really well for both of us at the time. However, I no longer need the money so I would be fine if he left tomorrow of own his volition.

Anyway, I know he is an adult and is capable of taking care of himself but I would feel really bad asking him to leave when we otherwise have no issues and have had a lot of fun living together. On the other hand, I feel bad asking my girlfriend to wait an indeterminate amount of time when I have no solution. Finally, this all makes me feel really bad because I don't want to screw over my friend but I really want to live with my girlfriend!

So I guess that is why I am turning to you guys. Am I being unfair to my friend by asking him to leave? To my girlfriend for asking her to wait when we both want to do this? 

What would be appropriate amount of time to give my friend? A month? Three? Six? Should I let him know what I am thinking without giving him a timeline so he isn't blindsided?

Very often, she will make a plan to do something and he will approve and give her the money or means to do whatever she wants. But then when it comes around, he takes it away at the last second. She almost missed her own dad's funeral because the day before she was going to leave, he wouldn't allow her to travel to the next state. 

Recently I moved about an 8 hr drive away with my SO. My mom has been planning to visit. She offered to bring my bike with her that I left at her house and to stay an extra week at my apartment while I am away at a conference to take care of my dog. 

Well, I know how my stepdad is. So I told her don't worry about bringing the bike and paying for a bike rack, my SO decided to give me one of his older ones which was an upgrade to my current bike and so she should keep it for herself. She was planning the trip but you could tell she was anxious. She kept making promising saying she'd be here no matter what. Now, I thought this would relieve her stress a bit if I told her that if for some reason she couldn't due to some obstacle, I have a friend who can watch the dog and that she could come anytime to my apartment while I am away at the conference. I just wanted her to not feel responsible and anxious about not keeping her commitments when the situation was out of her control. 

She misinterpreted me and started crying so much. She interpreted what I told her as me not being able to count on her. She is extremely heartbroken over it. I tried to explain that it's not her fault, I was just not counting on my STEPDAD. After you've seen this pattern for years you'd know why I would never count on him for anything. I was trying to relieve the pressure on HER. But my mom is not usually emotional like this, but once it starts, it kind of spirals out of control.

She isn't mad or anything but she doesn't feel like talking to me until she calms down. I feel so terrible about all this and I don't know what to do! I did not mean to hurt her. I absolutely know she would keep those promises if she could. What should I do?
   
**tl;dr**: My mom is with someone who is very controlling of her and often will not let her do things she wants or hold a job. She wants to visit me in my new home and she said that she would watch my dog while I am away on a trip. My stepdad could change his mind at any moment and not let her come, so I told her that if something happened and she couldn't, not to stress over it because I can get a friend to watch my dog and she can come visit ASAP without any obligations to worry about. She thought I said this because I couldn't count on her.

19740,Non-Romantic,2e4u7u,"Warning: long. Details changed. Throwaway.

Backstory: She was living in a bad situation with her dad and stepmom so I let her move in. I told her she didn't have to pay rent, just utilities and do the dishes. I know she has a lot of bills and barely has any money left over from her paychecks. Right before moving in, she asked if she could take in her friends dog. I have two dogs myself, so I can't really object. Besides,I love doggies! So I said yes. Enter kujo.

Kujo has had many owners apparently, and he's extremely untrained. He gets along great with my dogs, thankfully. Well,a week after moving in she goes to leave for work and he barrels into her room, knocking over her fan and shattering the window. She freaks out because he won't get away from the window and she's worried he'll cut himself, so she takes my dog out of her create and puts him in it and goes to work.

My dog has a crate for a reason. She ended up tearing a hole in the floor of my kitchen. Thank goodness she didn't find the glass window herself. My sister gets a crate for kujo. The first night I came home from work he's moved the crate across the house and shredded half of my living room rug. He hated being in that crate and constantly howled about it when we would leave. He bent and broke his crate and could now escape from it.

Finally we just left him out. As long as we put up the trash and kept things off the table he might get into, he's fine. Unless I take my dogs somewhere and leave him. Then he goes crazy. So anytime I go anywhere I have to take him with me and my dogs. He's horribly leash trained, and my dog that I keep crated is no better. My other dog is always fine and well behaved so I can trust him with off leash, but even on leash the other two are terrible.

I had a friend stay with us and he had a puppy. Kujo attacked the puppy three separate times and left gouges on his neck. She's had her friend's two puppies over to watch them and I've gotten stuck watching them while she's at work which is a nightmare. I asked if her friend planned to pay us or anything and she said yes, but apparently now her friend avoids the question when she asks. 

She also has had a friend of hers staying at the house because he was in an abusive relationship and left, and his ex came over one night and slashed her tire. Then the ex tried to kill herself by driving into a tree. The used tire my friend bought and put on for my sister busted so she got a new one from her stepmom.

I can't take my dogs to the park anymore. I have tried and I can't handle all three on my own. I wait until she gets home from work and take my dogs to the park to run a while. She doesn't hardly take her dog anywhere. While I'm at work she feeds them and takes them outside to potty and that's it.

I haven't seen her take him anywhere on a walk in a long time. On top of all of this, she's always going to hang out with her friends and is rarely home when she's not at work. She is not so great about cleaning and doing the dishes even though I've tried talking to her about it and she swears she cleans all the time (not true). Kujo's fur is everywhere.

We hired my friend at 5 dollars an hour, split between the two of us, so that someone could be there with kujo. I paid half because he's playing with and taking care of my dogs too, even though it's her dog that needs to be watched and mine are fine. Well, she got behind on that and she had to pay me back for it. My friend started a new job so he couldn't be there anymore.

Last night I told her I had to go stay the night at my mom's which meant I'd be taking my dogs with me. She said she'd be going to a friends house. I asked if she planned on taking kujo and she said yes. So today I came home and packed. She said she'd be leaving to give someone a ride and she'd be back. I told her I was leaving soon. I took him out to potty and put up the trash, grabbed my dogs and left. I even tied the bedroom doors shut.

I got a call a few hours later that apparently he had gotten through the tied doors and out of the broken window and someone had tied him to a tree with some wire, and apparently he was almost choking himself on it when she pulled up.

Apparently she thought when I said I was about to leave that I was going to the store or something and that if she had known I was going to my mom's then she would not have given her friend a ride. 

Now we're in this huge argument about how she never does anything with him and she's freaking out at me because of her anxiety and how she's had a hard month and how she doesn't have time to spend with him.

I'm at my wit's end with this situation. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've gotten a really crap deal out of all of this. My window is broken, my floor has a hole in it, and I can't take my dogs anywhere until she is home with him.

I just started a second job working at the same place as her and if I kick her out things will be insanely awkward.

I'm sorry this is so long and convoluted. It's a really messed up situation. 

TL;DR: my sister moved in with me, got a very untrained dog, barely takes care of him, he tears up everything, she barely cleans the house, and freaks out at me because of her anxiety every time I bring anything up.

19776,Non-Romantic,2xh9rg,"I graduated from college last semester. A few weeks later, I accepted a job offer that required me to move to another part of the United States, and leave many of my friends and my family support-network behind. I thought I was more prepared for this than I actually was. The practicalities of the transition have gone extremely well, but I didn't realize how much I valued my friend and family support-network until I didn't have it. That transition, the transition to emotional independence, has been difficult.

It is perhaps because of this isolation that I'm in my current predicament. My job entails interacting with two radically different kinds of people on the daily basis. I spend half of my time interacting with a lot of men and women who are 'like me'. They share the same interests, the same hobbies, and I'm pleased to say that I've made some acquaintances.

Unfortunately I spend the other half of my time interacting with people who are decidedly *not* 'like me'. I don't want to paint to harsh a stereotype, but many of these (almost exclusively male) individuals were in fraternities, and spent their college days working the system and the people who control it rather than learning. 

It is this exact attitude that make a person successful on that side of the business, but needless to say I don't have experience interacting with this 'type'. 

Worse yet, I was put in a somewhat authoritative/advisory role over these individuals. I can't terminate their employment, but I have the ability to override some of their decisions.

I tried to be friendly and affable to everyone, and it has paid off in my interactions with like-minded individuals, but it hasn't worked with those on the other side of the business. To be blunt, they are casually cruel to me. I get called everything under the sun a the daily basis.

To be fair to these individuals, I'm not an exclusive target. They talk to each other the same way. They are almost ritualistically cruel to each other. 

That being said, I'm having difficulty putting up with it. They see me as 'one of them' and because I work with/over them there is a lot of added tension. 

Early on, I was invited out to drinks with a few of them, and made a bit of a fool of myself (I don't have a lot of experience with alcohol; I'm a lightweight.) which gave them a significant amount of personal ammunition against me. They invited me out again but I declined; perhaps that was the wrong decision.

Sometimes I wonder if there is a concerted effort to 'toughen me up', and as a result I started trading jab for jab, but that has just made them more vicious.   

I feel almost childish about the whole thing, but it is, legitimately, effecting me. The one thing I know is that I can not talk to any of my superiors about this, or at least that is how I feel at this moment. I've confided in a few individuals about this and they suggested that, but by-and-large they don't understand how things work on the other side of the wall. I could voluntarily take on a different role, but the people who are the most valuable and highly-compensated in my profession do what I do; they are a bridge between both sides of the business, and management.

19779,Non-Romantic,2hnuzi,"To begin, I'll address the relationship between my father and myself. He's always been an absentee parent. He works out of the country, and I get to see him perhaps once or twice a year. This arrangement was because of his inability to control his drinking appetite- he would come home red and angry and yell at my mother. She used to hide me under the bed. We used to be very close, me and my dad, but I've always known that he was abusive when he still lived with us, but it is something my family never talks about. The fact that he molested me as a child is also never mentioned. I only recently came to terms with it after burying it inside for most of my life, and tried bringing it up to my mother. She does not believe me. 

I recently moved out of my mother's house, which was met by a lot of crying and horror on my mother's part. She went manic and locked me inside my room, then threatened to kill my pet hamster. I managed to escape, but not without scars. I cut my arms up in that room- that was the first time in months I had a relapse. 

I'm now living with my boyfriend. 

My father is back from working overseas, but I do not want to see him. However, he and my mother are both sending me very emotional messages that are pages long. He basically said in his message that he feels sad that he has to come back to an empty home, and that he's leaving sooner than planned because he cannot hold the pain in anymore. He also told me to be careful about making choices, because he's been there and I'll fuck up my life if I'm careless. 

He and my mother have requested to talk to me, and I agreed. I will be going back to school after dropping out, and I have no way of funding it by myself. I work a dead-end job in a small office and my salary is barely enough to cover rent and bills. I might need my parents to fund my education. There isn't a scholarship for the course that I want to apply to. 

I feel torn about this. One one hand I need to go back to school again but I would need to reconnect with my sexually and physically abusive father to do that. I'm not sure if I can and want to. Actually, I don't fucking want to but the messages that he's been sending me are driving me nuts. I feel like everything is my fault, like I'm hurting all the people who care about me. Like I'm a terrible daughter and an ingrate.
