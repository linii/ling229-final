173610,Relationships,2buun3,"Had my 'first sexual experiences.' Was with a married woman years older than me. Husband apparently doesn't perform, so I fingered her.  Not as emotionally attached to her as she is to me (says she loves me), started to 'cheat' on her with her best friend and co - worker. Still a virgin, but her co - worker is my age, I'm attracted to her, and she is patient with me. Was thinking of making co - worker my first girlfriend. Can't help to think I'm nothing to her because of my lack of experience.  Makes me nervous,  can't perform. Worried she will find someone who isn't as anxious. 

Feels like I got stuck in my own wake of bad karma. Never felt shittier in my life. Feel bad for the aforementioned husband. Still very embarrassed and ashamed I can't get it up. Not even to masturbate lately.  

Nothing is pressing at the moment, no fear of being caught. Haven't done anything with married woman lately, don't plan to.  

Really want to be exclusive to co - worker but don't know how to go about it. Miss her (co worker) a lot, she works often. Haven't slept in days. All of this has occurred in the last 2 months.

We spent senior year and the summer together, seeing eachother 3 to 4 times a week. It was a great summer, but I definitely put in less time with my friends than I would have liked to. 

We were very excited for college, it wasn't like all the other couples we knew who had to either break up or go long distance. We had the ideal situation. College started off great. I am on a sports team so I met a lot of great guys right off the bat and had plenty of parties to bring my girlfriend to. I would sleep over her dorm 2 or 3 nights a week. 

Fast forward four weeks, I'm already getting bored. It's not that we aren't getting along and having fun, but I just don't feel the same. It's not her, it's me. I miss chasing girls and going out without having any restriction on myself. 

I don't know if this is just a phase or if this feeling is just going to grow and grow. Would it be better to break it off sooner than later? Should I wait this out? We've been dating for 8 months.

145117,Relationships,2kwomr,"So this'll be a long one, so I'll put the tl;dr first. Though I really encourage you to read all of it..

**Edit:** I definitely wanna make clear that I'm not looking for approval to continue two relationships and emotionally cheat! That's *not* who I want to be. More than anything I'm just very confused and torn given how this has made me feel about my current relationship. 

**tl;dr**: I've started to slip into an emotional affair with a female coworker. But there's a long history of abuse and issues with my partner and they often make me feel scared, withdrawn, depressed, and utterly alone. It feels so incredibly validating and.. normalizing, I guess?.. to have anyone at all in my life who doesn't make me feel that way, that I'm not sure what's right anymore.

---

I've been with my current girlfriend for over 4 years, with a short period where we were broken up. I was kind of a late bloomer and didn't start college until 24 so really we've spent our whole adult lives together.


There's a lot of bad stuff in our history that I'd prefer not to get into, she has borderline personality disorder and after getting involved with her I basically lost all my prior friends and everything I had going on in my life and got swept up in hers. Nowdays she is on medication that helps control her moods but she still has severe anxiety issues. She has made it clear that she will never, ever be willing to talk to a therapist.


But like I said, things are a lot better than they used to be. We live together, and we don't often fight the way we used to.


Still, she often tends to make me feel stressed, alone, and like I'm not allowed to make decisions for myself. For example, there's bound to be an argument if I want to do something with a friend that doesn't involve her, and I wouldn't dream of asking her if it was OK to say, spend a night staying late in the library at school. I've always craved excitement and adventure in life, and as a consequence of this combined with an intense college STEM program my life is mostly very quiet and domestic which is really kind of hard on me. We have some mutual friends but I don't see them often because she doesn't like to involve them in/let them know about things we do together. Being at home so much, I'm not very connected at school - a very bad thing given what I'm trying to do careerwise - so I don't really feel like I have much of anyone to talk to a lot of the time, other than my therapist. I don't feel like I can always show her my true feelings, like if I'm stressed about school she's likely to panic and insist that we cancel all of our plans, even if I just want to cut out an extra hour of time to study.. I feel like I have to keep up this front of being perfect all of the time. She can be very critical and I really worry about her reactions to stuff like missing a call from her because my cell phone battery died or breaking stuff around the house or not getting ready quickly enough.


On top of that, I feel like every major commitment I've made to her has on some level been under duress. For example, the first time we moved in together, she was very clear that we were breaking up immediately if I didn't move in with her. I had already been considering moving in though, so I did and I actually liked living with her despite the fact that we fought a lot back then... but I still felt uncomfortable with how it happened. After we broke up and got back together - same thing, even though I was living with my parents to avoid working so I could do better in school. Move in, get a job and start chipping in for rent, or I'm dumped, period. More recently, she insisted I give her an exact time frame for when we would get engaged, and when we would get married, and promise her that we would have kids whenever *she* wanted them and the time frame was to be 100% her decision, not mine, though she said she would be willing to wait until I finished a graduate degree. 


This in particular really troubled me, for a couple reasons: Before I even met her, I always felt that if someone gave me an ultimatum of that kind, it would be the ultimate sign that I couldn't marry them, because it would indicate to me that they didn't share my values - that there's something fundamentally wrong with one person imposing their will on another, even if it can sometimes be a necessary evil. On top of that, I feel like it takes all the romance and poetry out of making that commitment, I don't know if that's a little naive but it's certainly not how I imagined getting married/starting a family would be. And it also makes me feel like she's just never been capable of trusting me to be committed to her, that she can only be satisfied with force. Still, I pushed through all of these feelings and stayed with her.


All of this paints a really awful picture of her and I have to say that's not the only side or else we wouldn't have stuck together for so long. When things are working, they can work so well - we're like kids together, we have a language and a world of our own, it all feels like *home*. She accepts me even though I can be pretty socially awkward, when I moved in the second time she was willing to give me some time rent-free to look for a job so that I could move in immediately as long as I helped with housework, and none of the issues I've mentioned are nearly as bad as they used to be before she started medication. Mostly, things around our home are pretty peaceful and idyllic... there's just all this awful history, and all this bigger stuff lurking in the background, in the back of my head.


Lately I've really been trying to take charge of my life more instead of being submissive all the time. I spend more time on my university campus while she's away at work, I've joined a volunteer organization, I'm making efforts to talk to people more. I'm really tired of not having any friends, I'm sick of getting mediocre grades in school because I'm actually really passionate about my field and really want to get into grad school and become a researcher in my field (which is also a whole other potential issue... even if I bring my grades up, chances are I'm not getting funded for a PhD at an in-state school.)


Anyway, as I've been making efforts to reach out, I've ended up connecting a lot with a female coworker. Now I've always had an easier time making friends with women than men and while my girlfriend can be very possessive she understands that and tries to tolerate it... but in this case I found myself developing a crush on her. Maybe I should have stopped talking with her, but the usual way I handle that is rather than letting tension build to keep a little distance but keep talking and eventually it either develops into a friendship or we stop talking and either way, any feelings I've had fade.


But with my coworker, there's something very different going on, and a whole different set of feelings. *She makes me feel like I'm not alone.* Since getting back together with my girlfriend I've again lost touch with most of my friends, and I can't fully express myself with her. I feel very lonely and solitary, every day. I've become introverted and withdrawn, I've started to have trouble with just talking to people now, I don't really ever make plans with friends (too stressful dealing with trying to keep my girlfriend happy, since I never really know if she's going to be OK with it or if it's going to cause a fight, even if she tells me it's OK to go out). I've started to get to know all of my coworkers better but with her - lately we text regularly throughout the day. And *it just feels so good to have someone I can actually talk to and share things with, I could almost cry.* You can tell where this is going.. I think I'm rapidly falling for her, and I think I can pick up that she's developing feelings for me, too. So basically this has started to turn into an emotional affair. And I should cut it off, right?


Only I guess I'm not so sure. The more I talk to her, and the more I feel this way, the more I *know* that the way my girlfriend makes me feel just *isn't how relationships are supposed to be.* Like I've always known in my head that your partner isn't supposed to make you feel scared and alone but I've always been so attached, especially because my girlfriend has been the one connection I do have, even if it's not perfect. But this whole thing is making me really understand it.. the more my feelings develop for my coworker, the more *whole* I feel. I know this probably seems trivial and obvious to everyone else but it just means so much to me that I'm able to be open with someone without having to fear them. Even just *being around someone who's thoughts aren't dominated by fear and anger* feels absolutely amazing.


I don't know what to do. I know no matter what I would never get physical with someone else while I'm still with a partner... It seems like the ""right"" thing to do is to cut things off with the coworker out of respect for my girlfriend. But doing that feels like allowing myself to sink back into a swamp of depression, withdrawal, fear, and aloneness.. Somehow it feels like I've been offered a lifeline and I don't want to let go. I'm really confused with how to sort out my feelings now. I still have a lot of attachment to my girlfriend but I think about leaving her a lot, but that feels like something tremendous and impossible. In any case we're on a lease which doesn't expire til next july, even if I did really want to leave. I think my therapist would probably tell me to keep talking with my coworker. Even if I *was* single right now, I don't even know if things would really work out with my coworker.. 

And is it really wrong to keep talking to someone else, when your partner regularly makes you feel awful and you don't have anyone else and they actually make you feel like you're OK, life's OK, and you actually, for once, have someone you can really talk to? But I don't think my feelings for her are going to go away, it feels different than it usually does, I feel like they're only likely to grow. I don't want to hurt my partner, I don't want to be a player, but this is like the only thing that actually makes my life feel normal. I don't even know where this is going... I just don't know what to do and really need some outside input.

179218,Breakups,1rcp93,"My ex and I dated for 2.5 years, and of course we had our ups and downs. Blah blah blah. In the end, we decided it was best to end things before we started resenting each other and before we started fighting. It was fine. Very amicable. Still talked occasionally.

We broke up 3 weeks ago, and the first week, I was fine. Week 2 it hit me hard, it was just so strange not being with her. Even thought I couldn't see her maybe more than once or twice a week because of our schedules, I still enjoyed texting with her and talking on the phone occasionally. For one reason or another she started texting less and less, and I started residing more and more in that cozy place in my head that hides me away from everything. I couldn't help but feel like she may have gotten with someone else. But I had no proof. Just a hunch. Just a feeling.

And I was right. We ended up talking yesterday and she spilled that she had made out with someone a few days back. I'm not mad at her, I can't be. It's how she is coping. I'm doing martial arts. I'm just so hurt. How do people deal with this? Do my sentences even make sense?

How in the time span of three weeks can you kiss someone else after being with me for two and half years! What do I do? Where is that infamous light at the end of the tunnel. When do I get to move on. HOW FUCKING DARE YOU? And then I'm ""not moving on""? I need to ""find myself"". Fuck that, I know who I am. I was giving you more respect than that! She said she wanted to feel pretty. LIKE I DIDN'T TRY? HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL. And then, her friends want to talk to me and thank me for being a gentlemen! WOW I AM NOT AN ASS HOLE! I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A HEALING PROCESS AND THAT SHIT TALKING AND BEHAVING LIKE A HIGH SCHOOLER DOESN'T HELP ANYTHING BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE. But I do. I want to know everything. And I want to put these MMA classes to use on that guy's nose. But I won't. I know that last part sounded douchey. I'm sorry. That's not me. I'm hypersensitive if anything. I am a mess. I am broken and defeated. I am emotionally drained and I want nothing more than to cuddle with her. And hold her again. She hasn't died, but a part of me has. Who has the AED? Just stick it on and hit the button a few times. Why do I have to be the one to be heartbroken? Well, if it wasn't me, it would have been her. I prefer me, and I hope somewhere down the line I'll be reimbursed with good karma. I want to be friends! I think? Maybe I just want to stay close to ward off anyone else. I don't know anymore.

Thank you. I love you for reading this. The ramblings of a broken kid.

61832,Relationships,2e5b6g,"Hey reddit. I am in an amazing relationship with the most wonderful man on the earth. There is no question that we are perfect for eachother and have discussed our future in detail.
I have just one problem, and it started in late 2011.

Here I am at a new job at a grocery store. Lots of friendly people and a great working environment. It's my first real job and everything was going smoothly until I saw her. The most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I'm a cashier and she is a shift supervisor (same age though, late teens at the time) so we work together closely and often. Every thursday morning I would open the store with her. It would be dead quiet until our ten o'clock cashier came in. It was just us and we got to know eachother fairly well. 

I first actually realized I was attracted to her a month into the job. We would chat and laugh and joke about customers. Eventually the whole hey add me on facebook topic came up. I did that that very night. Before all of this happened I thought I might have a chance with her romantically (I had admitted to myself that I was bi but was not out yet). So I held out hope for her for a while. 

I come out to my mom after work, basically telling her I like this girl. Being the awesome mom she is, she comforted me when I began to cry and apologize even though I knew in my heart that I would be accepted. My parents were rooting for me in my hopes for a relationship with her.

Time to look at her profile. Interested in: Men
My heart sinks and I start to sob uncontrollably. I have never been this devestated before in my life. I run downstairs and tell my mom still crying like a baby. She keeps telling me how sorry she feels and that she understands heartbreak and unrequited love.

My feelings didn't fade though. One day one of our delivery men asked her out on a date, she said yes. I began to spiral out of control. They broke things off a few weeks later. She talked to me about everything that happened and I had to stand there and take it.

With a mental hospital day program and a few cooling off months I managed to head back to work. So nervous on days that I would be working with her. I told someone in confidence that I had a crush on her and guess what? Word was out. I started noticing she wasnt talking to me as much, she eventually blocked me on facebook. This standofish and non-verbal relationship lasted until just about 6 months ago. 

In the interim, after many misadventures on OkCupid, I find my amazing boyfriend. We connect right away. A few dates in he confesses to me that he may have had a herpes outbreak in the past (turns out he hadn't). I told him I didn't care, as long as we were careful. Because of this I confessed to him my crush on this girl. I told him It had faded from my mind quite a bit (which it had). 

Fast forward to 6 months ago. She had previously been transfered to another department in the store but returned every monday to close the front end. I closed too. This slowly but surely forced us together and thus repaired our relationship nearly completely. Sadly what I had feared would happen did happen, I fell for her again. 

It was like before. Watching her hips and bottom sway with the rest of her perfect body whenever she wasn't looking. Listening to her laugh. Admiring her beautiful eyes and her warming smile. And her laugh, oh my goodness her laugh, it could melt the coldest persons heart. Her laugh was especially could when I caused it. Her smile was especially beautiful when I made her smile. Her presence was a blessing, and adrenaline pumping and sweat inducing blessing.

This last week she told me she would be moving back to her other department permanently. I told her she would be missed and she gave a shy grin. I watched her walk towards her register like I always do.

I had justified my attraction for her in many ways. Eye candy doesnt hurt anybody and it's ok to be attracted to other people but not act on it. Except I thought of her when I was unable to orgasm from oral sex. I pleasured myself to the imaginary scenario of me and her making love, all while being in love with this wonderful man.

Maybe and hour before posting this I pleasured my self to a photo of her I managed to dig up. I kept telling this .jpeg on this glowing screen how much I loved her and how someday we will be together. I broke into tears upon each climax.

I want her out of my head, but I love her so much, I'm worried that I might love her more than my boyfriend. And I hate myself.

tl;dr: Old crush is haunting me and making me poke holes in my relationship.

So to the ppl that have replied THANK YOU sincerely.

To the ppl that want to read:
I met this guy after my breakup with my 1st ever relationship. He was honestly the best! I never fell for a guy harder.. He would compliment me none stop always making me feel like I was on top of the world I was beaming ppl walking past me daily would say things that I was beautiful out of nowhere and I felt like it was bc of how he made me feel.


As time went on the same guy that did this hurt me severely. He was chasing other girls. I can't really explain it in another way he would find interest in another and completely and utterly belittle me and make me feel worthless.. For eg: I dropped him at the airport and picked him up he went away with a couple of friends and while he was away he had his phone switched off for a whole night and morning I couldn't reach him so when I got through finally I acted suspicious as to why? 
When I picked him up he went crazy at me for being jealous or not trusting him he made me cry how much he yelled at me.. I felt so bad for not trusting him.
Months later I found out he hooked up with a girl from over there that wkend and even started seeing her.. I found out this way: I went over we spent the night together slept together then he says straight after ok I need you to leave I need to make calls.. I said what? We got into a fight I called him a scum bag, on my way home he calls me and yells I do have someone else and yes I fukd her and I like her and it was good and your not ruining it! 
I cried and cried and felt worthless! I decided to move on and took up an offer to go on a date with someone. 

He found out bc my new guy was out one night in a mutual group of friend (I'm from a small town) and he was saying how he met this girl and she's beautiful and shows him a pic of me.. 
 
He went crazy at me msg after msg calling me every name under the sun (they weren't friends at all but he tried to pass it off as if I was low and went for one of his friends) I was still in love with him so I took it as he still had feelings and quickly stopped talking to the new guy and me and my x started seeing each other again. 

I shouldn't of. Things were really good until Xmas I was meant to spend it with his and my family.. Xmas eve a girl approaches me and says she had been sleeping with him she didn't know of me and she found out and said their was also (another) girl she found out about so she needed to tell me she said he was sick! She showed me msgs and pics (nudes) he sent her sex msgs all kinds of things! 

I told him and left. Hurt again. Spent Xmas crying in my room. He called and msgd saying he was sorry he fukd up etc.. Then he stopped. I spoke to him and asked why? How could he be so cold hearted? If he didn't love me why couldn't he just tell me so I could move on? 
He said ""I don't know why she even told you at all she knew about you the whole time"" 

I know I'm stupid for staying! But my feelings were strong and this was the only guy I was stupid enough to stay and get hurt so much over. I don't know if I stayed because I had lost all of my confidence and just wanted to feel worthy I really don't know? 

But idiot I am stayed again and then one of his friends (not close) asked me out on a date I declined and then he found out and went crazy at me again broke it off abused me.. Said I was seeing ppl behind his back said I was a slut said I was going for his friends I tried so hard to make him see I loved him and would never ever do that. 

I even thought he might be involved with another girl bc the way he was carrying on was kind of over the top saying he was going to pull me out by my hair bc I tried to talk to him.. 

I left it at that. Then I seen on fb that the girl I had suspicion over - he was liking everything.. So I msgd and said I had a feeling there was more to this and your friendship with her .. 

He replied I wish I could get her.. But I can't and won't anything would be better then this.. 


I am broken completely seething with anger I don't know what to do and he does not care at all what he's put me through and he's in fact making me out to be a whore and crazy and bad mouthing me to everyone! 

I feel so out of control! And sad. 

I wish I could make him pay for what he's done I wish I could hurt him

We have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We had had our not-so-good times but we are generally awesome when we're together. Which is the problem now.

But i think the relationship has hit its peak and conversations arent as interesting, theres nothing new to learn about each other, and dates just arent exciting at all. 

So recently ive been having this thought that either this relationship will go on like this indefinitely, and ill be lucky to have someone who cares about me so much but ill never truly enjoy my 20's or see whats out there for me; or I will eventually come back to this issue again in the next 5 years, and i will have wasted the best years of my life for nothing to show for it.

both of those possibilities scare me **shitless**, and i want to end the relationship soon before i just dig a deeper ditch for myself.

But then on the other hand, whats a relationship but a friend you can be emotionally an physically involved with? and if thats the case, you dont tell youre buddy to get out of your life permanently just because you think youve been hanging out too much, so in that thinking, why should i want to break up with her when there are no problems with the relationship? and thinking that you might not hang out as much with your friend in the future isnt grounds to cut all ties with them, so maybe continuing to date until a problem comes up isnt the worst of ideas?

Im *really* confused

1. Am i being a total idiot for wanting to break up with her because i think i might be wasting my life in a happy relationship, and because there could be something better out there for me?

please tell me some past experiences if you have any.

My ex and I were best friends for years before finally dating. We dated long distance for two years before the distance became too much. We split - two months later he showed back up, saying he loved me and wanted to marry me. 

Thus begin a strange will-we-or-won't-we-get-back-together for the next year. I couldn't get past the fact that we BOTH willing gave up the relationship because we were both holding back, yet he shows up two months later deciding he loves me and wants to get married. 

We've been in communication all this time. Suddenly - radio silence. My birthday comes and goes, and I hear nothing from him. I don't reach out either because he travels a lot for work and isn't always available; I usually wait to hear from him when he can chat - that's how we've always done it. A week goes by, and I've heard nothing which is unlike him. I finally log into Facebook and unblock his profile to make sure he's alive, only to discover he's in a relationship. 

I'm crushed, mostly because I had no warning.  Days before, he was telling me he missed me. Now he's moved on. I had no idea he was even dating someone. The obvious answer here is to just leave it alone, but I feel like I should reach out and at least hear it from him first.  I feel like I need him to be the one to tell me, since he never even indicated he might be seeing someone else.  I want to see if even mentions it. Up until a week ago, we were working on things.  

The fact that we were best friends for years before this makes this incredibly hard. I've lost both my best friend and a boyfriend.  He's been removed on Facebook since  we broke up, I'm hitting the gym already,, but despite the fact that we've been split a year I'm struggling. I can't eat, can't sleep, and I'm in a new town where I don't have any friends yet. Please give me your wise words of wisdom and make me feel better and give me a game plan for moving on.

A) should I contact him once? I REALLY feel like I need to hear it from him. B) my heart hurts. How do I deal with truly losing a best friend  and having no one during this crushing time?

TL;DR: boyfriend and I split up. We were supposedly working on things for a really long time. He disappears for a week, don't hear from him on my birthday, turns out he's for himself a new girlfriend, but I only found this out after some serious stalking on Facebook.

45224,Relationships,3bj6oa," Recently my husband and I made money off of some investments and it was agreed that I would quit my job. Basically I am feeling extremely grateful but also a tad useless. Being a stay-at-home wife you get a lot of criticism and angry looks and comments especially from other woman and family members. 
 
Personally I think the husband and wife are the foundation of the family and I think dedicating yourself to your husband is extremely underestimated in the society. 

Everybody wonders what do you do all day, you don't have kids don't you get bored. Basically I dedicate my life to making my husband happy. I make dinner every night and make his lunch, clean the house of course. Basically I'm trying to keep my body as sexy as possible so I work out really hard and I suntan every day because he likes my body tanned. Basically these are things I couldn't do as much when I was working.  I also maintain myself in every way possible and I know this is a little bit TMI but has been bought me a dildo and wants me to use it every day and then tell him about it and or use it in front of him at night. Basically have sex 3 to 4 times a week and or i jerk him off. 

My life pretty much revolves around making him happy and making sure he sexually satisfied so I buy a lot of outfits and sex toys. 

Of course not perfect I still expect a lot of him. For example I don't allow him to watch porn and sometimes I get mad at him because his parents are controlling. All these things are fine with him it's just my reaction he doesn't like it when I get upset.

I'm so grateful for everything he does for me because I know he loves me more than anything in the world, I want to try and perfect myself and be the perfect wife. Can somebody please give me some tips of how their wife is or how I can be a better wife. 

One thing I need to work on is my temper and not to be so hard on him. Having so much time sometimes makes me think negative, how can I keep a grateful and happy mindset? Does anybody have any tips on how I can do that? 


Also how can I come that the feelings of uselessness, of course sometimes I get bored and useless during the day. Within the next year I'll be getting pregnant so soon my life will have more purpose but what about in the meantime.

161311,Breakups,3b01pd,"My ex broke up with me last year, for the reason that we had communication problems and she fell out of love with me. We agreed on staying friends (with ""we"" I mean ""she"" and I just kinda agreed with it), because we had such good chemistry. 



It was a mistake, I couldn't be friends with her as I was still hurting. We kept hanging out occasionally until I decided to tell her ""I don't feel the need to be friends anymore"". This apparently hurt her really bad and brought her to tears (what I head from her friend), but my sanity was more important back then. 



Fast forward to two weeks ago. I'm in the best shape of my life, and I feel like I can take on the whole world. And BOOM she contacts me wanting to talk. We met somewhere private, talked about stuff and that she wanted to be friends again. I moved on so  I told her that we could work towards a friendship. We started texting occasionally, and we agreed to hang out soon. 



And now I'm sitting here wondering why the hell she would want to be friends with me again. Why would an ex want to be friends again anyways? It's over, there's nothing left and right now it feels really artificial to me. Like as if I'm being used for my friendship. 


The only reasons I could think of now is because she wants to be invited to the sick parties I throw occasionally, because I often invite mutual friends. Or it could be to boost her ego in one way or another. Even though the interactions are the same as during our relationship (without the intimacy) it still feels fake or artificial to me. I want to be friends with her, but I feel like if I'm missing out on a reason, the reason why she wants to be friends with me after months of no contact. 


Any thoughts Reddit? Could I just ask her why she wants to talk with me? What she expects from me as a ""friend""? It just all feels so weird all of a sudden. The feeling as if someone just walks up to you and says ""want to be friends?"", and you just agree to it because you know their shoe size and their favorite color.

46771,Relationships,1gags2,"I have been married to my wife for 5 years now. Let me start by saying that our house is a little different since I do the bulk of the cooking and cleaning due to her hectic hours at her job and I work from home, so I have always been a little self-conscious or emasculated, if you will, but barely.  In todays day and age, who cares. 

She had always been in good shape, in the fit sense, worked out a few days a week.  I was never one for working out but have always had some muscle definition.

Well 2 years ago she starts getting VERY into fitness and she is weight lifting almost everyday. She actually starts to put on a considerable amount of muscle. Not exactly her lean and tight body she used to have, she has gotten, well, thick and muscley. She just looks strong, you know what I mean. And I honestly don't care, if that is what makes her happy then so be it.

But now she is actually much stronger than me. Like, much, stronger than me. If I can't open a jar, lift up a box, whatever, I have to ask for her help and she just gives a sly smirk at me.

She tosses me around the bedroom and we are only doing positions she likes.  Even outside of the bedroom we are constantly doing whatever she wants I guess because she has this burst of confidence.

Now the tricky thing is, is that for whatever reason, I have had the opposite effects. I am becoming more meek I guess you could say. It feels like I now listen to her speak and wait to respond instead of having an open conversation on equal footing. I am just responding to what her life dictates, as opposed to us living our lives together as one.

We go to the movies, I want to see one thing, she tells me we're seeing the other. And on top of all this, I have been feeling like I have been getting weaker and skinnier with each day. I assumed this was all in my head until people have recently been telling me I look like I need to bulk up in one way or another because I'm looking frail. I have never worked out before, I have no idea why I would have a physical change now out of the blue.

I have talked to her about me maybe joining a gym too recently and she didn't seem thrilled with the idea giving me several excuses of why I shouldn't and never really said, oh that's great honey like I was expecting.

It's like every day we get out of bed and she is happier and happier every morning and every morning I feel more blah about everything and meek. I jokingly thought that it actually kind of feels like she is sucking or taking parts of me. She get's stronger, I get weaker. She gets more in control, I lose control. It's getting to the point where I'm feeling dull. Like I'm not as sharp as I used to be.

Friends are starting to notice how as my friend put it I'm like a sidekick to whatever my wife wants since she's the superhero. He said it jokingly but it actually felt shockingly close to home. 

Mind you, I have talked with her about this. She just dismisses it or gets angry since she is taking it as either me saying I don't like her body or telling her she can't lift weights because that's not what ladies do or whatever bullshit.

Is there a way to get back on equal footing? Are we already on equal footing and I'm just loosing my mind? Also, anyone with a reason why I would be physically slimming down? I feel childish for letting something like her body, or strength get in the way, but it's more than that now.

146945,Dating,1mfu1p,"This girl, we'll call her A. Had been in a hooking up with one of my best friends for an entire year who has a lot of problems, we'll call him J. A was deeply in love with J but J only wanted to stay with her to have sex and when me and him were alone with other friends all he would talk about was how much of a stupid bitch she is and how he only wants to fuck her and leave her.

After about a year of the two of them hooking up I finally met her. The two of them have only made it to first base maybe a handful of times. A few days after I met A I started talking to her online and she asked me if J liked her as much as she liked him. I wasn't going to say what J told me in private about his intentions because that would ruin his chances with this girl. She started talking about J and saying how much she loves him and how much she cares about him for about 30 minutes. She asked me to talk to him asking about her. I texted J and he said ""She's a stupid bitch because she won't touch my dick."" I had a very hard choice to make, I could either tell A what he said, or lie to benefit one of my best friends since we were very young. Now let me get things straight, J is not a bad person. He is a great friend and he was very good to his previous and only other girlfriend in the past, he just does not like A.

I decided to tell A the truth because I felt like she did not deserve that. She was heartbroken and me and her talked until around 2 am about everything and I felt a very strong connection with her. Me and A have a lot in common and I think she is really cool. For the next few weeks A was purposely ignoring J and trying to make him jealous. ie: giving me a hug at school without acknowledging J even though we were standing next to eachother. Stupid stuff. It didn't bother J.

Every day me and A would text each other and then get home and video chat. Things were really great, she started to get over J but there was only one problem, I started to get feelings for her. She has still not gotten over J, one of my best friends so there is no way I would ever try to hit on her or anything like that. Until last night when I was drunk.

I was just drinking with some bros and she texted me to call her so I stepped outside and we talked for a while and she was crying saying how hard it is to get over J and I said ""A, you are amazing, I think you are one of the coolest girls I know and you are beautiful and you can do so much better."" Not bad right? Then I went on to say ""It wouldn't be hard to find a guy that treats you the way you deserve to be treated, and you could easily find I guy who cares about you. If I wasn't such good friends with J I would be SO into you."" and immediately after I said that I was like noooooooo.

She awkwardly said thats really sweet and she told me to go have fun with my friends. I hung up the phone and then get a little more intoxicated and things got worse. I started trying to tell her that I wasn't trying to hit on her or be romantic and then I was just sending so much stupid shit that I regret SOOO much. I texted her like a million times when I could tell she didn't want to talk anymore. The more I tried to convince her that I wasn't in love with her but everything I sent her made it seem like I loved her even more. I ended the conversation last night saying ""What I'm trying to say is that I think you are a really amazing girl and I am never even gonna talk to you about me and you in a relationship or anything. I just feel a very strong friendship with you. I have never cared about a girl in a not romantic way as much as I care about you. I just really want to be friends with you. I love you, but not like that do you know what I mean?"" and she replied with ""Yehhh i gotchu shawty""

When I woke up today I apologized to her but it was very awkward and now I feel like I can't even talk to her. Every text I send I immediately think is the most uncomfortably weird thing ever and she hasn't really been responding like she usually does and I feel like the two of us will never be the same after that. All I want is to be her friend again. I am perfectly fine with her being off limits to me but I just want this awkwardness to go away so we can go back to making each other laugh and stuff like that. Did I mess up as bad as I think I did? How can I fix this?

114031,Relationships,2xmjvr,"I posted online looking for a FWB last August and he replied. We actually hung out that night and 3 more nights in a row. We got along very well and were actually surprised at how much we liked each other for being strangers. I had given my number to another guy at one point and he got quite upset even though I didn't pursue the guy at all. Eventually the subject of being exclusive came up and he definitely wanted to be exclusive but not have any titles or hold a ""relationship"" status. That didn't sit well with me and eventually he became distant and basically told me we just didn't have enough in common to have a relationship. Blah blah, the end.



We hadn't spoken in months and I sent a text message during Christmas telling him that I saw a company his family is associated with and it made me think of him and wished him and his family a Merry Christmas. He also wished me well and nothing more was said. No bad blood, no drama. 



I went away for Valentine's day weekend to visit my mother and a friend was also coming into town for a hockey tournament. When I came home Sunday there were two bouquets of flowers on my porch unmarked. I thought they might be a surprise from the guy I was actually recently dating and when I thanked him for the flowers he said they were not from him [awkward!]. The only person I could think of that would leave them were the ex FWB since the company his family is associated with is a flower shop that he works for on major holidays. I sent a text asking if they were from him and he replied 3 days later ""perhaps..."" After a few texts he asked if I wanted to hang out. 





He came over the other night and we talked all night. He has said that he has been going on actual dates since we parted ways and is on Tinder but not looking for hookups. We did talk about us a bit and how it ended between us, etc. I don't know if something between us triggered him to want to date or what but I'm not sure what he wants from ME at this point.

100247,Breakups,2mvtv4,"A little background: My ex and I had been dating for about 2 years, the first year was amazing, very loving and exciting.  Basically, a full year of honeymoon stage.  This past year has been very tense with lots of fighting, mostly she attacking me for being a man-child.  She has anger issues and would fly off the handle for what I considered very slight offenses. We've been breaking and making up for the past year.

She'd always given me her passwords for her phone and such, but I never went through it, never even looked at her message notifications when I was alone in the room with her phone.  I would not give her my account passwords and was pretty private with my things.  Mostly because I'm not one to throw out digital things; pictures, messages, emails, I tend to leave them there as a kind of history.  I have AIM chat logs from the 90's.  There were things in there that I did not want her to see from my past, not just the sex tapes but also messages from when I was in my early twenties, breakups and fuck ups, my being an idiot and vulnerable.  Even journal entries that did not show me in a good light.  I figured her phone and accounts were her personal space and it was none of my business.  Everytime I went through her pics I asked her permission to go into each album.

During the first 6 months, she had asked me if I had any pics of my exes on my phone.  I lied and said no.  She then proceeded to delete all her exes pics of her phone.  Then 1.5 years later she is scrolling through my phone all the way down and finds sexy pics of one ex and a sex tape of another.  She loses it.  Spends the next 48 hours screaming and calling me names, telling me she should have cheated on me, that she's going to hook up with her old fuck buddy, saying I never loved her, crying hysterically.  She even let slip that she had ex-sextapes of her own on a thumbdrive, though that may have just been her attempting to hurt me.  I've never seen so much anger.

I honestly almost never scrolled down that far in my pics and when I did I did not linger on those sexy pics.  It wasn't just sexy stuff, there were pics of all kinds of things, from every stage of my life.  The sexy pics were just mixed in there.  I lied because I felt like my account was my own space, like my memory.  It was the equivalent of a box she kept with memorabelia of her exes.  I know I should not have lied.  I know I hurt her very much and that if I had been in her position I would have been destroyed as well.  I know I should have deleted them but I didn't.

I never cheated on her, never even flirted with other girls, never messaged any exes, or kept fuck buddies as FB friends ""just in case"". I would make eye contact with pretty girls and avert my gaze.  I was faithful to her one hundred percent... except for this.

I feel like the biggest asshole-pervert in the world.  The remorse is eating me alive.  We haven't been broken up a week but I can't eat or sleep.  I spend all my day staring at the wall, drinking myself into a stupor and torturing myself for my bad action.  And I miss her!  So much, I dream about her everynight, vivid dreams.  I wake up and it feels like there's a thousand pound weight on my chest.  I want to reach out to her, to beg her to come back to me.  I deleted the pics immediately when she found them, but 1.5 years of deception is too much, no?  Also, she told all her friends and family, who did not like me at all to begin with.  She even sent me a screenshot of her friends badmouthing me in groupchat, calling me a loser and a pervert.  She's blocked me on everything.  I want her back so badly.  But I can't see how I can walk into thanksgiving dinner with her family after they know about this.  

Should I just walk away?  Should I go to her door, get on my knees and proceed to beg my heart out?  If she has made good on her word and revenge fucked her fuck buddy, should I be ok with that as penance for my action?  Am I a huge asshole for not deleting those pics?  Should I feel so remorseful that I can barely look at myself in the mirror?

Well... we have been together for almost three years come April. We started dating the summer before I transferred to a college that was two hours away (we were originally from the same hometown and knew each other a year beforehand). I was head over heels for him immediately and had a huge crush on him the longest time, and this blinded to the point where I ignored alarming behaviors.

Come fall he helps me move into my dorm and proceeds to visit me continuously throughout the semester. He eventually moved to the town my college was in and come the next semester I was fully moved in with him and have been living with him since. We ended up moving to another state 9hrs away where my family had moved to, in order to pursue a graduate degree. 

I really liked him, love him. He is a great talker, loves it and is now a salesman (it fits him like a glove). One of the things that attracted me to him was his motivation, he was a big talker and really wanted to join the Navy Seals or become a Marine. That didn't pan out, and he shares that he really wants to become an engineer (fantastic!). I was so into him because finally he was a guy that had some plans, had some shit together. During the time we have been dating he has not attended school, save for one class that I had to take over for him so he didn't fail 1 out of 3. He never showed up on time, let alone attended most days and would lie about going. He is in all honesty better at working.

This has been my longest relationship. I have dated some really not so great characters and I thought I had really found the one when I met him. We had a lot of things in common and I loved his passion, I thought that we could easily fulfill a plan of our lives together...... Now comes the part where you guys can lay on harsh judging, I have it coming. He has exhibited mentally abusive and physically controlling behavior since the start. I had never been exposed to it before and thought his jealousy was okay, he convinced me I should be happy he is jealous. I have many examples for this... but I want to keep this short as there are other things that deserve elaboration...

I have tried to breakup with him a handful of times since we started dating, each time he talked me out of it and I couldn't find the strength in me not to leave. It wasn't until we had been living together that I saw his violence. If I had talked to a guy, a male friend text me, anything of the like he got mad. He was really pissed about me driving to school. He would insinuate that I left early for school because I was going to meet some guy (We lived up north in shitty winter and I was a commuter--- I needed a chance to park and then walk up hills for class). We left our first apartment with about 3 or 4 fist size holes patched up in the walls and one busted door...

Next apartment, I tried to break up a couple times, one of the first we had been drinking and I confessed I was unhappy and couldn't deal with his obsessive behavior. He got mad and thought I was cheating or something... I try to end it, he chases me around the apartment and ultimately tries to do something severe... (I don't want to describe it on the internet --- lets say he collects and supports the second amendment wholeheartedly). Another time I try to end it -- he threatens just driving off into the wilderness. In short whenever I've tried to break up he pulls a card of I literally can't and won't live without you. I am so guilt ridden I always came back, he promises to be better...

Now we have moved states, I've finally been able to make friends and its liberating. My main friend was in a abusive marriage. She has shared with me and is concerned. Which is why I am finally opening. I have so much more to say but I don't even know where to start with his behavior, what he says to me, how he treats me...

I know we need to end it. But I am so torn. He has lessened up considerably on the violence, however our new apartment already has a punch dented door, there are arms under the bed, and we are so financially tied. He has little family here, he has always moved with me because I feel like I was his ticket out of a shitty town and poor prospects. When we moved here he got me tipsy and I was convinced to take out a credit card (he talked me into needing to build my credit) he also had the card put in his name (he filled out the application). First two months he racks up $3,500 in debt tied to me. Owes me 4000 in back rent... not to mention his part of utilities.

My friend tells me how she dealt with her shitty ex until she had enough finances to leave him (about a year) and then boxed up her shit and left. I don't want to wait a year or more. Its pulling teeth to have him give me any money he owes me. I don't have anything signed by him saying he will pay me back, and I should (I love court shows) however if I make that move I think he will know I plan to leave and wont anyways. Our apartment is loaded on my parents furniture that I cannot move alone. Our lease is up in July....

I don't know what to do. I keep trying to make it work. We went out to see the new Clint Eastwood movie tonight. I was visably crying and freaking out and grabbed his arm to console me during a graphic seen (the one with the drill...). He didn't even look at me or do anything to make me feel better, which made it worse and reality sink in all the harder. He talks down to me, says I have attitude all the time, and doesn't even listen when I talk but the reverse is expected from me. I can't do this for another year. I want to just cut and run but I can't.

99867,Relationships,3a1wig,"I don't really know if this needs to be here, in /r/sex, /r/deadbedrooms, or /r/atheism, but here goes. 

Been married twelve years. We have two young girls (5 and 8). I was never religious, I just considered it something people did. No feelings whatsoever about it. She went to church (raised Southern Baptist but now is Methodist), so I went with her (her home Baptist church). She knew I wasn't 'saved' or baptized, but I said I was open to learning about it. It just never really interested me at all. 

Fast forward about 9 years. I realized I really didn't believe and wanted to know why. Previously, she had said that if anything regarding atheism ever came up, we would have serious problems, so I was very nervous about what I was learning. So I learned why. Really I probably learned too much, but whatever. At first I was very angry and confused and made a lot of people mad on Facebook with my incessant questioning but I learned to accept that people believe different things and it helps them make sense of the world. I'm totally cool with that. 

However, I told my wife one night that I thought I was a skeptic. She bawled her eyes out. Totally inconsolable. All she said was that she was always told to 'never be unequally yoked' (2 Cor 6:14). It was bad. Really bad. We had talked before about her beliefs and how she believed that if someone didn't get saved then they would go to hell. I asked, we'll then you believe I am going to hell? She said yes. So I knew kind of how I ranked in her world I guess as a nonbeliever. Later I asked her if she had read 1 Cor 7:13 which says a woman married to a nonbeliever should not separate, but she got mad that I found her a loophole. 

Anyways, things have been pretty crappy for a while. She was depressed and started going to therapy and started some medication that killed whatever libido she had, to the tune of once a month or so. We went to couple's therapy as well (I went to my own therapist at the same time, too) and she professed being totally okay with sex once a month. Her therapist is another conservative christian housewife, so I think they tend to commiserate on a lot of things. So sex is very infrequent. 

I'm on medication myself and have finally reached a point where I just don't care. I'm not sure I love her right now but at the same time my heart aches just thinking of splitting up. She is adamant about the fact that she loves me but I have heard on numerous occasions in her family that familiar 'love the sinner, hate the sin' phrase. Essentially her love for me feels forced and fake. 

I am the sole provider for the family. She had an opportunity to get back into the field she was in before kids but decided to stay in her current position making $8/hour. I'm cool with it, whatever makes her happy. But her whole life her parents have helped her with bills and everything so I don't think she has much of a respect for personal responsibility or what it feels like to be flat broke (we are very close right now). 

So I don't really know what I need to do. I'm sure that I'm going to hear a lot of 'well you should have talked about this before getting serious'. Well, yeah, no kidding, but it really wasn't an issue then because I didn't know how important and devisive it is. Right now we are just floating a day at a time, running on empty. If we split up, I doubt her lifestyle would change at all. I pay all the bills, the mortgage, car payment, keep up the house, yard, everything. She tends to take care of groceries and cooking. (Yes, she is fine with it.) 

At first I worried what her family thought of me, but now I pretty much know they love me but still think I'm a hell bound heathen. I don't abuse my kids or wife, and love them totally and provide for them, so what's the problem? I guess that's another topic. 

I feel lost and scorned and alone. Some of her friends even stopped talking to me when they found out about me. Just the other night she and the girls got invited out for a play date and I was not. It's cool though, whatever makes her happy.

I just don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for the rambling.

5218,Relationships,2lwrhc,"Hi all - pretty cut and dry scenario I am in. My girlfriend left to go home about a month ago for a variety reasons (i.e., brother is dealing with a lingering health problem, to visit family, to work on a project she is passionate about) and now it seems she is cutting me out of her life. 

A little background: we have been in a serious relationship in a major city but were not living together. She has been having a rough time - shitty job, lack of direction, and she generally has some mental health issues that she sees a therapist for. However, we have been in love through it all.

When she first told me she was heading home for a month, she explained all this to me (although I knew the reasons why she was going). Deep down, my gut was telling me there was a chance she would not return. I told her I feared she would not come back, but she unequivocally promised me she would. 

Throughout the course of her month long visit, our communication significantly dropped - mainly from her end. She already has a difficult time keeping in touch with others, even her own family, but she was very busy with her brother and project. I let her know that I was still hurt by this and we got into a few spats as a result, but she acknowledged that she should have reached out more since we were apart. However, she continued this lack of communication for about another week.

A very important note: on one drunken night, I was upset that I hadn't heard from her for a while. I was confused and stupidly kissed a girl at a bar my girlfriend and I frequent. One regular bartender was working and I presume he saw this. I am not entirely sure if the bartender even knows we are in a relationship, or if he speaks to my girlfriend outside of our visits, but this event did happen. 

A few days ago, on one or our calls (initiated by me after not hearing her for a few days) my girlfriend told me she is torn between moving back home and coming back. I was hurt by this, but I can't say it was all too shocking. We spoke about this, and I made it clear to her that I can't force her to make this decision. I told her I want her to return, but ultimately it is her decision to make. She told me she missed and loved me, and I could hear it in her voice how confused she was. She even hinted at me moving to another state to be with her.

The next day I shot her a text telling her I would appreciate if she contacted me. My phone died that day and I was out all day. I returned home at night to find no texts or voicemails from her. In hindsight, it is possible that she called and I simply did not see the missed call because my phone died. In another drunken moment, I sent her a very pointed text calling her a coward for phasing me out and essentially ending the relationship.

Today, I needed to speak with her. I want to know everything she is thinking, and where we stand. Upon calling her, I find that it is likely that she blocked my number. And this is where I now stand: confused, heartbroken, and unsure what is happening.  I am unsure if she blocked my number because I informed her that this over, if she somehow found out about the girl I kissed and was waiting for me to tell her, or she just needs time to think.  If anything one has any insight whatsoever, or could offer their perspective from am unbiased and uninvolved point of view, I would appreciate it.

We started dating when I was in high school and he was not (live in his college town). I went to school 20 hours away and so during the semesters we are in an LDR. For the most part we do fine LD, we skype, text, call, etc. Get in more fights while apart but nothing huge.

We're both working full time this summer and have less time to do things. At the beginning, we hung out a lot maybe 2-3 times/week and once on a weekend. Since we've started working he seems to never want to hang out during the week. He says hes tired and wants to go to bed, which I understand, but I am going back to school very soon and want to make the most of our time together before I'm 20 hours away. On the weekends, he always wants to ""make the most of them"" by going out to the bar with his friends or doing other things with his friends. I'm invited sometimes, but I don't think its fair that he prioritizes time for his friends, time for both me and his friends, but not time for just me.

I have already brought this up with him and he said that it wasn't intentional and he was going to work on it so I didn't feel that way.

During the week, we do hang out, but it keeps getting less frequent. He wants to be home by 9:00 and all we do is go out to dinner or see a movie and never just hang out and do nothing and enjoy each others company like we used to. We also never have sex during the week anymore (used to like every other day). I know he is just doing this because he's tired. I get that, but I also don't want to waste time since it's going to be hard away from him. I feel like I just want him to want to spend as much time with me as I want to with him.

He is ""family,"" in the sense that he is best friends with my cousins, and he comes to holiday functions and such. Lost my virginity to him when I was 18, and he put up with a lot in that period, dealing with my severe depression/ anxiety and residual issues with molestation. After our breakup, we continued a FWB relationship (so we call it), while in reality, we've often functioned like we're together, fighting and the like. We've also been through a lot; roughly two years ago we had a miscarriage together. This guy has beem there through everything, but always shies away from commitment, even if I've expressed before how much I wanted to go back to that. We say I love you and such, and he was the first to say it to me. 


Guy number 2 is much more recent. I've known him approximately a year, and I have never met a human being I just connected with so easily and who just clicks with me. We got super close super fast, having similar mental health histories that we bonded over (I.e. we're both pretty fucked up). Around march or so last year we started getting physical, and we maintain a pretty on again off again physical relationship. I KNOW that regardless of what he claims, theres more to us than friends.... its the way he acts around me, and I've had other people point out the same thing, things like, he'll watch me after I walk away, but he doesn't do that with anyone else. He gives major mixed signals, and our friends who like to meddle say that they see what I see, and he definitely cares and will openly admit that he loves me but he won't take it that step further. 

Both boys are very much aware of the other. Both boys act jealous of the other. I've had fights with both of them that stemmed from their anger about the other, even if they won't admit it. They both claim they don't care if I sleep with the other. 

Most recently, guy number 1's mother lost her battle with brain cancer. His whole demeanor towards me has changed drastically. The lines in our relationship have fuzzed a LOT. For instance, cuddling was never an option unless it directly led to sex. Now he wants to do it all the time. I can't figure out if its a comfort thing that he needs... or if hes coming around to taking things further. I told him I wanted to be with him, but he hasn't given me a straight answer aside from that I should never be afraid to discuss my feelings with him. 

I had sex with guy number 1 on sunday. Guy number 2 knew I told guy number 1 how I felt. Regardless, he showed up here and one thing led to another (this was tuesday night). Despite his claim that staying the night together ""made us a couple so we can't do that"" he stayed. And I realized that I am 100% in love with him, and while I do love guy number 1, I am not in love with him. I haven't seen guy number 2 since though, as he left for the weekend for his mom's wedding... asking me to go with him wasn't even an option, because guy number 1's mom's funeral was the same day (irony). 

After the funeral, yesterday, I hung out with guy number 1's family. While he has always been a part of my family, I was never a part of his. The dynamic has changed, and they all were telling me how i'm family, cousins from across the country knew who I was and heard ""so much"" about me. His step father invited me to go with to spread her ashes... I felt uncomfortable with that because it felt to private for me to intrude, and the whole thing was overwhelming. 

I ended up staying after with him and having sex with him then, 4 days after I last had sex with the other guy. I guess thats part of why I'm overwhelmed. They both say they're cool with it, but show obvious jealousy if I even talk to the other. I also feel guilty telling guy number 1 I wanted to be with him, then sleeping with and realizing my true feelings for guy number 2. 

To be honest, I really enjoy sex with both of them. If either would be willing to commit, I definitely could and would drop the other immediately. Its only because they say its okay that I even think of sleeping with the other. I know since I havent committed to either that that makes me a bit hypocritical, but I also truly love them both, and it freaks me out. I also know that they really do love me too, which is why I am scared to lose either of them.

The problem is that I have no idea how to bring this up to him without it sounding like an ultimatum, because, well, I guess it kind of is. I don't want to pressure him into dating me but at the same time, if he doesn't want to be exclusive then I don't think I can do this anymore...

the fight was over me asking her friend i she moaned about me much( i know dump question) but that opened the can to everything and know she thinks i don't trust her. so with all this happening on Tuesday i acted like something happened and  but tried to move on and act back to normal; however she didn't.



now i believe shes expecting me to break up with her as: 

* she hasn't talked too much over text like Thursday(the day after the talk) we sent 3 texts each. she said today that she doesn't like texting and do you not need space? like i feel suffocated most of the time like i need time to myself and to chill out 
i feel like shes creating distant and pushing me away.

124484,Dating,2jtj8e,"Sort of a rant but any feedback/advice would be greatly appreciated.

I’ve been dating this guy for 6 weeks or so, we met 8 weeks ago and immediately hit it off. Let’s call him John. Things have been going great, we’re currently somewhere in between dating and moving toward a relationship. We both have shitty relationship histories so we’ve been moving slowly to foster trust. I really like him and all evidence suggests that he feels just as strongly about me as I do him. He always makes me feel like he is the luckiest guy to have met me, and says he feels unusually drawn to me, always asks “Where did you come from?” We are two peas in a pod.

One issue and huge trigger for me is being pushed away after intimacy, which I suffered repeatedly in the past, for years, obviously making me feel used/unwanted/worthless, etc. (This will come into play later in my story.) I’ve done a lot of work on myself over the past few years, gaining back my self-esteem, learning to put way more value into sex, and being wary with guys in general, making sure I don’t fall for anyone who will do that to me again. I haven’t been with a guy in over two years. The last guy I dated ended up being a psychopath and after him I decided to take a break from guys and focus on me for awhile. Apparently John did the same thing for the past year or so. 

So yea, I have had a few casual encounters in the past two years, but I didn’t get seriously involved with anyone and I didn’t have sex with anyone. John has been great so far and not given me any reason not to trust him. It has NOT been easy for me to try to trust a guy after almost never trusting one, but I have tried my best, and I am sure I have proven my trustworthiness to him as well. Our time together so far has been peppered with some insecurities now and then but nothing we haven’t quickly gotten over with some rational discussion. 

So this weekend I finally went and spent a couple nights with him at his place. We live a couple hours apart and I made the trip up and we had a couple great nights together, and we had sex. John knows that sex is sacred to me. I think two people should give each other extra care after having sex, especially for the first time. My intention was to bring us closer. We had a really nice weekend. I cannot think of anything that went wrong.

We affectionately parted ways when I left. Since then it has been radio silence, for the past two days. John is on vacation from work this week; he’s just chilling at home the first half of the week, and is driving a couple hours away out of state to work on a project with one of his friends for the second half of the week. He has preparations to do for the project and has been procrastinating for the past month and is now trying to cram it all into a few days. 

I know he is busy and stressed, I get that. However, since I left, he has not hit me up once. We have spoken every single day for the past eight weeks, since the first day we started talking, and we talk frequently throughout each day, but not over the top or anything. There was just absolutely no warning to him dropping communication like this. When I have tried to talk to him his responses have either been short and robotic, or he hasn’t responded at all, not even just to say good night back to me, even though I know he sees my messages. He has not done this before, he always responds. He has made it clear I am on the back burner to his project. At first I didn’t know what was going on and brought my concerns/confusion up to him, saying I know he is busy and stressed but doesn’t want to seem to talk to me, reminding him about my history and insecurities, saying I just need a little reassurance or to know if something has changed. He basically just replied saying his project is getting all his attention. I am pretty sure he knows that my feelings are really hurt, yet he can’t find even two seconds to give me some reassurance. He is usually quite affectionate and has shown zero affection since I left. If he had even just given me a heads up I would have been totally fine, i.e. ""Sorry but I'm going to be really busy the next few days and won't have much time to talk, but just know it's not you"" or something.

I have made it abundantly clear to him in the past that the worst thing someone can do to me is push me away after intimacy. We already had an occurrence of this nature on a smaller scale (no sex was involved though) a couple weeks after we started dating, and he felt like a jerk and apologized a lot for doing it. (That’s another story but I trust that he realizes he handled that in the wrong way and was really sorry.) I don’t understand why he would choose this time, right after we first had sex, to push me away. He must know that this kills me. This behavior feels really uncharacteristic of him. I can feel my trust in him crumbling away.

We’re supposed to meet up for dinner before he leaves the state, like tomorrow, but I don’t even know what’s going on now. I don't accept that this project entirely prevents him from communicating with me. When you care about someone you can always find time to make them feel valued, and I am by no means clingy, needy, or high maintenance. If he even just sent me a freakin heart I’d be happy. It doesn’t seem like he’s going to hit me up at all this week. 

I just feel super betrayed. I’m not going to hit him up, but I don’t know how to respond when he does hit me up, and I have no idea what he’s going to say or if he’s going to acknowledge any wrongdoing on his part. Am I overreacting? Any feedback? What should I say when he gets back in touch?

My wife confronted me and was devastated. I felt dead. Every tear tore at me and made me hate myself. However, I lied once more and convinced her that we were only having phone sex. I promised the stars and the moon to her if she took me back. She agreed. 


After a few months she was accepted at a job in Chicago and off we went. I was good for a few more months and the started again. Many times I just call escorts and ask them their donation, or what they're into. I started just masturbating to videos, then hotlines, then web shows, then strip clubs. As soon as I cum, I'm filled with guilt. How can I do this to someone I love? Am I sabotaging myself?

135107,Dating,1n0ksn,"I just started my second year of college and I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to be a residential assistant for the school year. The hiring process started during the spring quarter of last school year (March-ish) and we were notified of our acceptance at the beginning of April. Because of this, I've been friends with my staffmates for a while now.

One of these staffmates (we'll call her Serena) has a friend (we'll call her Nicole) who she is living with this year that is also working as an orientation leader for the incoming freshmen. Because Nicole and the other orientation leaders work a lot with the residential assistant staff (Serena, Me, others), I've been talking to Nicole quite a bit for about two weeks now.

I first met Nicole around mid-May of this year and immediately found her to be a very nice and attractive person. I let my friend, Serena, know of this because Serena asked me about it in conversation one day. Although Nicole and I didn't talk much for the rest of that school year (May-June), she still grew on me just from being around her. Once Nicole moved in for this upcoming school year (residential assistants had been moved in for two weeks prior to the orientation leader move in), I immediately started talking to her and hanging out with both Serena and Nicole.

I have talked to Nicole privately before as and had several long and interesting conversations with her, and she's been growing on me very quickly. However, Nicole knows that I like her as Serena told Nicole near the end of last year. Long story short, Serena has been acting like the middle-man between Serena and I but in a very double-agent sort of way. At first, Serena was very open as to how Nicole was feeling and what Nicole was saying about me, but lately as things have been picking up between Nicole and I, Serena has been saying less and less which makes me very curious as to what's going on. Serena has told me that Nicole isn't ready to date yet just because of how short we have been talking, but I feel a strong mutual attraction that sometimes just makes me want to ask her out in the middle of a conversation.

A strong reason that I have so much doubt about waiting is because it seems like Nicole cares much more than what she has been telling Serena (or what Serena has been telling me). For example, the other night we all went to go watch Lord of the Rings in a community lounge. Although there were people already there and they were making a lot of noise, we still decided to watch the movie. I had sat down at a couch in the back expecting Nicole to join me as I was the one that invited her to the event. When Nicole arrived, she sat in a chair right next to where I was sitting (within touching distance), but I was surprised that she didn't sit down next to me. Serena ended up sitting next to me and Serena and Nicole proceeded to text each other throughout the first hour of the movie. I had caught Serena texting Nicole at one point and Nicole was expressing concern as she was unaware of what she had done (e.g. she was oblivious to me wanting her to sit next to me) and wanted to switch spots with Serena. Serena confirmed if she wanted to switch and they agreed that it would be too awkward to just get up and switch spots in the middle of the movie.

Because Serena keeps telling me that she's not ready to date yet until she gets to know more of who I am, I am unsure of what to do mostly because it feels right so often to just ask Nicole out right there and then. I feel like this is a very generic type of situation to be in but if anyone has any advice on how to go about this, I'd appreciate it.

37272,Relationships,1t0zdj,"So I have a slight underbite. For most of my life, it really hasn't been too noticeable. Only a very small handful of people have ever noticed and/or brought it up to me. Additionally, it hasn't really affected my romantic or social life in anyway, and speech problems have been limited. I really don't know what caused it since I didn't always have it. It kind of just slowly appeared towards the end of high school. The doctors have a bunch of theories from sports injuries, wisdom teeth, and incorrect tongue placement.

So back to the present: my girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months (3 months in person, 3 months doing long distance). She's great! She's everything I've been looking for in a girl. Things have been going superbly. I really love her. She tells me she loves me as well and that I'm perfect, flawless etc etc etc, all that mushy stuff. Not to mention she's very attractive while I'm only average looking.

Recently, I've been noticing that my condition has gotten worse. It seems to be becoming more noticeable and I think I may need to pursue some sort of treatment in order to fix it. The thing is, I have no idea if my girlfriend knows about my condition or not. She's never mentioned anything about it and she's seen me in all different settings and from all different angles. We spend a lot of time together and I feel like you'd almost have to notice after so long.

If she hasn't noticed yet, I'm afraid one day she will and just get really disgusted by it. But I have no idea how to bring it up to her or whether I should at all. I understand physical attractiveness is an important part of relationships and I don't know if she'd ever be able to look past my condition. Not to mention it really has been causing me confidence issues ever since I saw that it has gotten worse. It'd be terrible to lose her on something like this - especially after we've spent so much quality time together. What should I do?

My boyfriend and this girl would always stay over eachothers houses and share the same bed, affectionately call eachother 'baby' and say 'i love you', argue very passionately and intensely over things and just general stuff like that, kind of like he was her spare boyfriend that she never actually kissed or slept with.

I obviously had a problem with it and told him I wouldn't be with him when he had another girl like that, he completely understood me and made a lot of changes so I would be more comfortable. She was unhappy with those changes and thought I was just out to get her. In the end I had a big argument with her where she said that he never liked me and some other bad things about him that I think were intended to put me off him, when I told him about her reaction he became very angry at her and decided to not talk to her anymore. 4 months later and they still haven't had any contact, and I doubt they will again now. 

After I had that argument with her she blocked me on facebook, which was cool with me. But last week I noticed that she had unblocked me again. Now today I can see that she has once again blocked me.

113408,Relationships,2cpt4y,"We’ve been together over 3 years, got engaged almost 2 months ago now. He’s very affectionate and loving, but also definitely emotionally immature.   
When it comes to disagreements between us, it is extremely difficult to talk through things. He gets defensive very easily and raises his voice, talks over me, takes the conversation in a strange zig-zag/circular pattern rather than settling one topic at a time. For example, if I mention something relevant that he did which I didn’t like, he’ll find something from the past/unrelated that I’ve done that he didn’t like, going totally off-topic. He interrupts me A LOT (his voice is much louder than mine, and I choose not to yell), but when he is talking to me, and sees me open my mouth, I get “STOP”, “DON’t interrupt me”, “NO, let me finish” before I can get any words out. Recently, when I called him on interrupting me, his response was “that’s because what you’re saying is bullshit.”  
Basically, his defensiveness completely removes him from listening to my feelings, he invalidates my feelings, will not talk at a normal volume, and gets so lost in a discussion-turned-argument that he’s yelling and slamming his hands on the coffee table or on his head, throwing things, hitting things, etc. He had to shut the door to the balcony so he could continue yelling and would not let me go and open it back up. This kind of behavior has made me fear for my safety. I do not know how to discuss disagreements in a normal, adult manner.  
I feel like I’m dating two men: the sweet one who is loving and fun to hang out with, and the angry one who is explosive and scary and I want nothing to do with.  
We have been to couples counseling before, and he uses it against me, basically making it sound like I’m causing all the arguments, I’m reacting the wrong way, etc. I am happy to admit that it takes two people for a disagreement/argument, but he likes to place all the blame on me. He has also gone to counseling by himself for his anger issues, a few years ago now, for maybe about a month, and we didn’t have any big yelling arguments for several months after that so he thinks he’s cured.  
I’m afraid this will never change and I’m afraid, 5-10 years down the road, of children being in the next room while he yells and slams things. Is there any hope?

183699,Non-Romantic,35vjp4,"We both have a history of depression. I'm currently medicated (Venlafaxine, Burpropion). I turn 19 in July.

I love my computer. I love my online friends. I love to workout and like to skateboard on occasion. I am a full-time student. I don't have a job (it's mostly for a lack of trying, I've done about ~20 applications). I have mild insomnia and require a lot of sleep so I'll usually sleep till 1 and take a nap around 5 or 7. 

She usually leaves in the morning to do something and comes back in the afternoon. Let me use today as an example. Before leaving she told me she walked the dog. Cool, so the dog doesn't need to walk before 5. I get up a little later than usual, take a shower and fix myself some food when she comes home. As soon as she gets home I can feel it. She's stomping around in passive aggressive mode. 

She asks if I walked the dog. 

I say ""I didn't."" 

""Great. Of course you didn't"" and calls the dog over in a bad tone. I can hear her muttering and stomping around as she leaves the house, banging the door behind her.

Later, she comes home. Angry about stuff. Stomping around again. I'm still in my room eating (I take long to eat) she storms in and looks very angry. She starts talking to me about cutting my internet time short, setting up a password so I can't access it after 11pm. I say okay. I'm calm and collected, she seems flustered and angry. She clearly wants me to do something so she says that she'll just cut it entirely if I don't get a job, raising her voice. She says ""you don't do anything all day, you never go outside, I have no choice.""

""I said okay, I don't care. That's alright."" I am calm. I don't remember what she started saying but I didn't like her tone so I turned back to the computer and pretended to read some reddit posts.

Later: I'm going to the ortho. She needs to drive me there. So she does. We get there early and she insists that I stay in the car and talk. She seems calm so I decide to stay. I am calm. She asks me if she is asking too much of me. I say no. She asks why I don't want to get a job. I say I'm scared. I say ""you get angry often and you raise your voice a lot.""

To my surprise she admits that I might be right. But then, bam. She's right back to being her old self. She starts getting angry again. ""Only because you... yattiyattayatta."" I don't remember.

I interrupt her to tell her she is raising her voice again. She's angry now. She starts going off so I open the door and exit the car and say ""that's why I don't want a job."" It doesn't make sense. But it makes sense in my head. I walk off.

When we get home, I go to start the dishes. She comes in and says something like ""I need the kitchen"" she's annoyed at me. I ask her if she wants me to leave. She says yes. I make sure she knows she doesn't need to make me dinner. This sets her off. ""Whoa"" she sticks her hand in my face as if to tell me to back off. ""I know, you don't want me to help you, so I won't. You're on your own"" she says this very angrily. I don't say anything. She says more things about me not wanting help and how i'm on my own. Saying that I need to get my blood test done at the hospital rather than have her do it (she's a nurse) because I'm a grown adult who doesn't want any help. She slams the fridge and yells something as I walk away but I don't hear it.

Then I start typing this out.

Just a few moments ago she stomped over to my room to tell me she's done with the kitchen. I look at her in the eye and nod. I go back to typing this out. She comes back in a second later and says that the kitchen is free in a loud voice. I nod again, and go back to typing and she stomps back to the living room.

It should be noted that when I say she yells, it's less yelling and a really negative and loud tone of voice. Sometimes it's a mock voice (of me), sometime's it's just a pissed off voice. The TL;DR also includes a little extra info/context you might not have been able to pick up from my story.

**tl;dr**: My mother is passive aggressive. She gets upset at everything I do wrong. Admittedly, I fuck up a lot. I'm a failure. I know this. But I'm trying to get better. It isn't easy and the idea of job searching is stressing me out. I attend school and I am guaranteed one when I complete my three year CS program. So I'd rather stay home, work on projects, skateboard occasionally, and focus on getting back to the gym. It should be noted I stay perfectly calm when she is lecturing or yelling at me. The most I'll do is turn my head from her maybe pretend to read from her if I feel she is being disrespectful and I am getting upset.

148558,Breakups,1nb6re,"So from my 2nd year and throughout my 3rd year of university i had this gf, il call her E. The relationship was amazing, there was a spark and although we had our fair share of bickering/non-bad arguments (mostly me being blunt and her getting upset), the relationship from start to finish couldn't have flowed better or played out more like a fairytale. Just imagine a film (except none of the problems) and you have it.



15 months into the relationship we both want to do a masters at uni, so get a 1 bed flat together. both of us are very excited and it is essentially a perfect dream come true at the end of summer...then disaster strikes



we get jobs working at summer camps for the same organisation but at different location (this was good and planned dw), but it means large amounts of time apart and very busy schedules.
my 5 weeks away i didnt see her, but we had a skype based relationship. Then as i finished she went away so i visited. 



The relationship from the moment E started work went south fast. I call she couldnt talk, i text she replies an answer and the convo dies, i ask to skype she is too tired after work, i question her why she always has time to go out and she says to see her friends and they drag her but cba with finding time for us.
I visit and her work call her and she is so hung up in work (on her day off) we have to go home so she can phone the boss and sort stuff out. Not entirely her fault but its your day off, just turn your phone off and enjoy it.



On one occasion she said ring in 2 hours. i was heading out so rang after 90 mins, she shouted at me and said i never listen and said i was a dick and basically laid into me...hour later i got so many apologies (screamed psycho at me lol)



So having now argued most days for the previous 2 weeks with E over her never trying and me wanting to have more of a relationship than 3-4 texts a day i visit her for her bday.
I spent £350 on her bday, im a full time student with no job, its a LOT. She acts guilty and like she doesnt deserve them. The 3 days i stayed at hers she acted like she didnt really want me there so i said ok then look its not working i did everything i could lets call it a day and went to a friends for a few days.



E and i had a holiday booked 2 weeks later. We said we both were sad and we would see how it went. Im kinda clever, not sure if i also have somewhat mild ADHD but my brain never turns off or stops or slows, so i didnt, i couldnt overlook the signs. i asked her flat out if she cheated. she said no and made me feel bad. This happened at least twice.



The holiday
At the airport i make a joke about finding another girl, she says she would help me and i got annoyed because part of being my girl is not wanting other girls to have me. She goes off in a sulk.
She wont put her phone down (red flag) and i ask who it is, she shields it and says her mum. I see it says C, a guy i know she said was from her summer job and liked her. I ask to see, she says he is flirting and i cant see because it looks bad...she flirted back (eluding to her wanting to fuck him). I get pissed off.



On holiday now i want to give her a chance, lots of arguments may have forced her to like the attention, lets give E the benefit of the doubt. So we spend it as a couple and the entire first day there was a spark and things were amazing. I couldnt let the phone thing go though, i had to see. So i fight her for it and see, she cries (red flagggg) and says itd be over if i saw. She had kissed him when we were together. 


Anyways holiday was amazing and we spent it as a couple but the entire time she refused to give us a chance and it meant that when back it was over. She now told me she didnt want to do her masters as well, but she still loves me.


This brings us to now. 

E has a job and is setting down roots at home 2-3 hours away
E refuses to move in or closer in any way
E said she would try for us as she loves me. She offered me an LDR that wouldnt have the chance to be anything but that for at least 5 years.


I said look, we had everything. what happened. her reason was:
i want to travel, with you id be happy and content and probs travel but may not fulfil all of my dreams and id have some regrets. i love you and wanna end up with you but its just bad timing and i just cant.


she says she loved me, once said she would move anywhere for me. now its bad timing, didnt really compute for me.

I offered her:
1 - month (or 2) at home LDR, then a promise of a month here, see what she feels at end
2 - move in and see how it goes
3 - breaking up and never speaking to one another ever again

(as a side note, i promised her if she gave it a go it would not only be slow, i dont really trust her tons atm, but also that i would make sure she travelled the world and not only didnt miss out on a thing but said id make sure her and i did extra as well)


you can guess her pick already...im apparently unreasonable and i gave her no choice and expected too much


every day i get texts saying how sad she is. but i ask if she would change her mind at all, nope.

    I constantly have to go over there because she is crying and scared he will do something after her continuous rejections. It's getting to the point I have absolutely no clue what to do. I tell her multiple times it's not her fault. I tell her he is just lying and trying to manipulate her because she is a caring person. The best way I can describe this is that he is holding her emotionally hostage. 

    This constant stress is running her mentally dry with her immense amounts of schoolwork. Which in turn is pissing me off because she does not deserve this.

111669,Relationships,2442um,"So, my boyfriend and I have been dating for about 7 months and I told him fairly early on that I have depression and that sometimes I feel awful for a bit for no reason.  I've been to therapy before and tried several medications, but for the most part I've been able to keep it under control lately by not shutting myself off from my friends, keeping busy, and telling myself I know it's only temporary when it starts to come up.

When I am in a bad spot, I tell him how I'm feeling and ask him to just talk to me for a bit since it's helpful to have someone there for you to vent to or to just tell you it'll be alright.  However, he refuses to do this.  He basically tells me that I'm not going to be ok and it's not going to get better unless I go to therapy.  This automatically makes me feel awful because I've tried therapy and medications, but I prefer to use my own techniques to feel better.  It feels like he's just brushing me off.  I even ask him specifically to please not try to give me advice and to just be there to listen and comfort me, but he still refuses.  He just tells me to list to him what I've done to help myself get better, and if what I'm doing isn't good enough to him, he says I'm not trying hard enough and I'm not going to get better unless I try harder.

It's incredibly frustrating because while the things I do to help myself (going to my classes and getting my work done, quitted getting drunk on the weekends to cope, staying in touch with friends rather than keeping isolated) are accomplishments for me when I'm feeling bad, to him they mean nothing and show that I'm not trying hard enough.  I try so hard to help him understand what I'm going through and what I need from him when I feel that way, which isn't much.  I even tried to show him a comic I like that explains depression pretty well to help him understand how I feel sometimes, and he just gave me an analysis of the comic, saying that the analogies were weak etc. instead of attempting to understand.  I just need him to be there and listen to me, show that he cares about me, and let me know things will be ok.  I feel much less alone when I can hear that from someone and it helps a lot, but I can't get him to understand this.  What should I say or do to help him understand my needs, and why it's important that he's there for me when I need someone to talk to?

I’ll provide some backstory;
It’s new year’s eve, I always go out with the same group of friends ,we like to fool around and like most times before going to any party we start drinking at a friends place ( it’s cheaper, it’s cozy and fun to start the night off).

After that we go out to the place we usually  go out; after a few hours this girl approaches me and starts talking to me. She looks stunning, we end up kissing and hang around with each other for about 1,5 hours. Before she leaves I ask her number.

Now I was pretty drunk and I guess she was as well.

So  the next day I’m fighting my hangover. And am  arguing whether I should text this girl or not. I end up with that I should not text her , reason being; “we were both drunk it would just be awkward, she probably doesn’t even remember me “

I stick with this for a few days, but today I am really questioning why I didn’t just text her.

The thing is at this point it has been 6 days and I think I will look like a creep if I text her now.

“Hey remember me you kissed me six days ago” doesn’t really sound good right ?

So should I still text her ? 
If so what should I text to her?

140348,Relationships,2z3igi,"I'm an idiot. I've been with him for 4 years now and we're/were supposed to get married very soon. We've gotten in many fights before, a few of which I thought would be the end of us, but I think this one is THE last one. He's military and very, very, very long distance. 2 things I know I cannot do. But I was with him before this and it's temporary with only a few more years to go so I thought I could tough it out. Today I was in a funk about it. We both get into slumps about this. I was asking him a bunch of questions, not being annoying or malicious just ""do you miss me"" ""how do you feel when in your slump"" types, but then I started getting the feeling I should get off of skype soon and go to bed. I should've listened to myself.

His roomate returns and earlier he said he talks more with me than hangs out with the guys (his choice). He joked, at least I think he did, that he should go to a casino with them. I think he was joking because he knows how I feel about gambiling and casinos in general. I'd be as comfortable with him at one as much as he would be with me getting a lapdance from a Chip N Dale. So I said that's not funny. I'm thinking this guy knows I'm in a bad mood and not up to hearing this sort of joke. He asks what's wrong, so I bring up Hooters. Another place of discomfort for me that he's joked about going to before. He says Hooters is a family restuarant and even asks his roomate to back him up. 

Here's where I probably destroyed our relationship. I say ""alright let's go when you're home on leave. You and me."" He says ""really?"" I confirm and repeat that we'd go. He says ""No you'd get mad at me!"" So I'm just out of control of myself at this point. ""Alright fine I've got plenty of male coworkers, one can go with me"". Silence. ""Go fuck yourself"" he says. He hangs up.

That was 30 minutes ago. I've sent 3 texts, tried calling on skype 3 times and tried calling him 4 times. I'm not upset or angry or anything, I feel numb. I just feel nothing, even though I could have run my love of my life away from me by being in a bad mood and taking it out on him. I'm giving him space right now and bracing myself for his angry break up text/call whatever method he uses. I'm also antcipating him to tell me he just got back from a casion or hooters. I said sorry and acknlowedged I was wrong. 

I feel like the life I wanted and what we could've had was ripped away from me because of the service when I know it was the only option he had to make a better life for himself and he only kept me in mind. It was my insecurity and selfishness that brought what I'm 98% sure is the end of our relationship and engagement. I really ruined it. Really messed it up and now it'll never come back. Sometimes I feel like I could easily be replaced though. He's attractive, has a wide variety of interests, is very skilled and sociable. I'm boring, I don't do much, I don't like to do much. I feel like he's no scared of losing me like I am of him, and maybe I subconciously push that at him to see if I'm right or not. I blew my own happiness and his too. Ruined it all.

132836,Non-Romantic,20r4xl,"So I have an aquaintance that works at an ice rink I go to frequently. He was friends with my older sister quite a while ago and I see him around all the time so it's not like we're strangers. He and I often talk when I'm there and he's a really nice guy. Often times the rink's online schedule is innacurate and the other day I was complaining to him about how sometimes I'll go to the rink and there'll be hockey players on the ice when I want to practice (I'm a figure skater so practicing while hockey pucks are flying around is not ideal) or the rink won't be zammed after a hockey practice. He offered that if we exchanged numbers I could text him and ask him if the rink is clear before making the drive down, so I gave him my number. 

Almost immediately after I left he started texting me almost non stop. Like, literally. If he texts me and I don't reply within 5 or 10 minutes he'll practically spam my phone. It's ridiculous. I'm a big texter. I text a lot of people quite a frequently, but this is way too much even for me. He literally texts me all day, every day, if I don't reply he will continue to text me and ask if I'm okay or if I'm safe. If I fall asleep he will keep texting me for hours afterwards. If I'm driving somewhere he will text me while I'm driving. If I don't reply for whatever reason he will keep texting me until I do. 

It also seems like sometimes he tries to flirt, but he knows I have a boyfriend and I have never shown any interest of that sort towards him. 

He's kind of a quirky guy, he has some sort of pituitary gland disorder so he's really short and awkward, but really super nice. I have suspected that he has some kind of social/developmental problem as well or something like high functioning autism, but I don't know for sure. He's pretty normal, just overly friendly and doesn't seem to grasp what is acceptable socially and what is not. I.e, he's overly friendly and overly helpful; like he'll offer to untie my skates for me or put on my shoes, carry my bags, open doors, etc. He once out of the blue offered to give me a scalp massage. I kindly declined his offer... He's just awkward... To me it seems like all the things he's doing are coming off as pursuing me, like texting me all the time, complimenting me, asking me questions, etc; but he knows I have a boyfriend and I have never ever let on that I might be interested in him in that way. 

I don't want to come off sounding mean, I do enjoy talking to him in person, he's a nice guy. This is just way too much and it's wearing on my patience. I don't want to be mean to him or hurt his feelings by telling him to back off, I've been trying to hint at it, but to no avail. I don't know what to do. Advice? He doesn't have a whole lot of friends and I would like to keep being his friend, but his over attachedness is throwing me off. 


Additionally,  I have said: ""Could you please stop texting me so much? If I don't reply it means I'm busy or I don't have service. You don't have to keep sending messages if I don't reply"". It didn't really change anything.

##25\M\2½ year relationship

  You could say that my girlfriend and I are “*in love*”. I have been in a fair number of relationships with women in my life and I take this one very seriously.... we both do. I know that relationships are hard work and I give my relationship “110%”, all of the time.  I consider myself to be an honest and serious man. My girlfriend is younger than me by 4 years.  That’s the context.....*sigh*

  Recently and more often I find myself feeling guilty for instances where I had no intention to hurt or upset my girlfriend. I often try and sit down and explain myself to her, but she doesn’t seem to understand that her actions and her words make me feel guilty.  Am I going crazy?

&gt;**Ie. A typical situation could be;** 
&gt;&gt;*The plan is to sleep over her place (I still live at home, yes...) but because I have plans near my house, the next day, I decide to sleep at my house. She goes into super beast bitch mode and I have to defend myself and somehow I always end up feeling super guilty and shitty.*

  I am sympathetic and empathetic. I have been since the beginning. I make as much time for her as I can, I constantly re-plan my life so that it fits with hers, I try and plan and do as much as I can with her. 

   I am at a point where I feel like I am actually going crazy because she’ll tell me that I’m too emotional and that I overreact. I’m actually beginning to think that I am the one that need help like a psychiatrist or something. **I can’t tell the difference between when I truly fuck up, or if I’m just overreacting to her passive-aggressive spiteful responses like my frontal lobe isn’t fully developed and I’m a confused 13 year old.**

   The relationship is truly working but sometimes in the occasional arguments that we do have, I’m truly tired of feeling guilty for shit when I try my hardest. Am I going crazy? I feel like she is the crazy one sometimes...

She was overjoyed at what a truly nice person I was and was constantly showering me with praise and even crying sometimes when she couldn't believe my generosity and aid as a friend.


She had become extremely clingy. Constantly texting me that she missed me or was feeling lonely when I was with other friends. I am her whole world at this point it feels. but I was okay with that. I am okay at dealing with clingy people.


This week we are having a very good time and just before the weekend she says she is going to a bar with some students from her class. The next day I don't hear from her which is very weird. Then the very short texts that seem completely uninterested start. Now when I ask her if she wants to hang out she says okay but blows me off when it's time to meet. I am very confused as to what is going on and she will no longer meet or text me anymore.

I really like this person, and her friendship was always positive and enthusiastic. Being cut off so suddenly is leaving me with a lot of questions and bad feelings. Being unable to talk with her is making it so much worse as I have no resolution.

I am at a loss for how to deal with this.

113187,Relationships,21rzd0,"So me and my girlfriend have been dating two years. We dated for a year in college and then both graduated. I moved to a city about 8 hours away and I'm in grad school. She stayed at home to take a year before med school. We've been doing long distance for almost a year, seeing each other once a month and I'm starting to have my doubts about long distance/our relationship. 

The issue is that I'm in grad school for 4-5 more years and I can't change where I live. She on the other hand has missed applying to med school for the fall so she has another year and a half of living at home, and I'm really doubting that she's going to do it at all. I asked if she would think of moving here but she says she's doesn't think she can since she's never been far from her family for long (shes very close with them and lives with them now.). And she tries her hardest to avoid talking about moving here. I know I can't do 4-5 years of long distance. I'm miserable being this far away, and I'm starting to wonder if I should end it if she doesn't want to move here. My lease is up soon so it would be the prefect time to do it.

Complicating things further is that I was introduced to another girl by a mutual friend. We've hung out in a group, but we've been talking a lot. She makes me feel smart, wanted, good looking, which isn't always the case in my current relationship as my GF isn't the most affectionate, though I know she loves me a lot. And I would never end a relationship for a girl a new. But coupled with the long distance its made me reevaluate my relationship and I have no clue what to do, or really what to say to my girlfriend.

19367,Breakups,2h4680,"Here's the back story. I'll try to make this as quick as possible. I dated my ex for three years. I have to admit, he is a pretty good guy. We connected extremely well and have so much in common. Though, on our third year I began to feel somewhat unsatisfied. He started getting too comfortable with the relationship and therefore stopped trying as hard to make me feel special I guess you would say. Now I must admit that yes, I can be needy sometimes. Not extremely needy, I just like knowing that I matter and that my SO is proud of me. We were never the type to parade around our relationship, though it would have made me happy if we were at least a tiny bit corny sometimes, and I believe that he knew that. I also would invite him to come on trips with me that he would always deny. Jumping from relationship to relationship since I was 14 years old, I finally started feeling like I need to be single and focus on myself for a while. I had never had the chance to do that. I also started having interests in other guys, wondering what else is out there (not that I wanted to be in a relationship again any time soon). A bunch of drama later, mostly caused by me being confused, I decided we needed to break up. We decided to be friends, and I went to live out of state for a few months.

Then comes the girl who makes me furiously jealous. My ex and her started becoming friends while we were dating, and I was always jealous since I wasn't used to my ex having female friends. When I left, they got really close. Always posting pictures of them together on social media, blah blah blah. A bunch of shit attention like that which I wish I got while we were together. I am back in my home state now, and it's just gotten worse. She even invited him on one of those trips I mentioned earlier that he denied me for and of course he went with her. I've asked him numerous times why, and he always says he was just comfortable with me and that the two of us girls are different (whatever that means). Oh, and apparently there are no feelings between them.

He's one of those people I will always love no matter what. The first one I really really loved. I'm young, and I was very confused with myself. This time I've given myself to be single has helped me tremendously, but now my jealousy (I think) is making me either have feelings for my ex again or think I do. I've been depressed about it all weekend, it's ridiculous. My ex and this girl talk constantly and are super close and it drives me nuts. He's even purposely hidden times when they hung out together because he knows I'll get upset. I guess all I want is the attention again, but I also keep thinking about what it would be like if we were together again. I've also told him all of this yesterday, and he does not have feelings like that for me anymore. He led me to believe that by being really flirty since I've been back home, cuddling with me and everything. Now he thinks I should take some time not talking to him so I can get over it. Not working out so great for me. I deleted all social media so I have nothing else altering my mood. I woke up this morning still extremely upset about it, though. I texted him telling him I'm sorry and that I won't bitch about this girl anymore as long as we can be friends. This shit is making me feel like I'm going crazy. I have training for a new job today, and I have no motivation what so ever. I go to sleep crying, wake up crying. There's things I need to do but I can't even get myself out of bed most of the time. I also want to add that all of my close friends are in other states. I have no one here that I'm comfortable with to distract me, which makes me feel even worse. Why am I acting so crazy?

21080,Non-Romantic,2vcpo4,"**tl;dr**: So I (23F) live together with my siblings (one is 13M, the other is 15F), and my divorced parents (55M, and 50F). Neither my mother or father bring in any real income right now (dad is waiting to hear back about background checks for a job, and mother is waiting for her disability case to either get appealed, or denied). There is constant fighting between my parents, and its overall toxic, and pulling me more into a depression. 


So below is the post that I made on recolor originally about this, since I was directed to come here for help (I edited this for language, just in case this isn't allowed here, and one paragraph removed, since I don't think its fully relevant to the whole picture). There's additional information there in my comments, but since I can't post links, I'm not sure if should add that to my post or my responses as needed. 


So let me explain the background to the problem. So my divorced parents aren't bringing in any income. Instead they're all relying on my disability along with my siblings disability (which is a little over $2,200). My mother is still waiting for hers. She's had her case, but now has to wait for the decision for them to either deny it again, or to accept her appeal, and who knows when the judge will want to get to that. Could be months from now.


My dad applied to sears, and is supposed to be a manager for them, but he's still going through all these background checks, and who knows when he'll start working. His income stopped back in November. This is now February. The only bit of money outside me and my siblings disability, has just been either from my brother(21M), or one of my mother's friends. Just enough to get some food or help go towards a bill that isn't a high priority.


I did plan to go to work originally, but then I thought against doing it because it would screw up the little bit of foodstamps we get and need (to save the other money towards other things such as the bills and gas), and I'm not sure if taxes would be pulled from my income either (and I'd probably only be able to work part time anyways). Plus I don't want to lose my disability. 


So now the real problem. I've absolutely had enough of my divorced parents arguing because there isn't enough income. I'm getting depressed again because of it, and this just happened shortly after I got out of therapy for finally getting better. I'm sure our neighbors don't want to listen to that either, even if the walls are concrete. 


First off I've had enough of her threatening to hurt or murder my dad (as well as starve him, because he's not paying for the food, because he can't right now), just because she hates his guts. Secondly, god forbid we tell her to stop with the arguing, or fighting, or yelling, she instantly will get all defensive and tell us to all go to hell. Yes my younger siblings too, because they totally deserve that kind of response, (like my sister the other night didn't want her starting again, and she said to stop, and she's all like go to hell and she did it again today when I told her enough). 


I already tried to explain how this fighting is hurting us mentally (all 3 of us, her children that do live here, all have depression, which just gets worse as this goes on. The two that don't live here probably don't.) because it happens so much and she refuses to hear me out. Because raising my youngest siblings in this kind of environment is totally going to make them behave and react better in school and home? At least my dad listened and got the point, and in fact, he stops when I ask him too. She on other hand doesn't get it. She'll just keep going on and on. 


So what can I do in this situation? Should I try getting back into therapy again? I really don't think I can ever get my mother to stop starting these fights, unless she leaves, which isn't possible right now. Also what can be done about her constantly threatening to either hurt or kill my dad (and starve him too)? Is there anything that can get her to stop that? I don't care that she hates his guts, but that's not something you should be saying around your kids, period, let alone something I take very seriously. Plus I wouldn't put it past her to try to do something someday if he doesn't get working soon.

My Girlfriend Lets go with Megan wants to get an apartment with me, and my Best friend Austin wants to move out of their apartment and move into an apartment with me.

All of us currently live in separate apartments once being neighbors to each other, and we all currently have roommates. As I have had roommates for the past three years (different each time) I have grown tired of having roommates and honestly want to live by myself. My GF and Friend have had similar issues and want to move away from roommates and live with friends/lover, while all of us definitely do not want to move back with family members.

The reasons I do not want to live with my friend are as follows:
1. His past two apartments have always been a state of mess and disarray and even though I am not a neat freak I like to keep a clean living room and kitchen for when company is over. This is a problem with my current roommates as the kitchen is always dirty. The biggest problem with Austin and his Roommates are that there are sometimes bugs and food sticks to dishes and pots because it takes so long for them to be washed. (One of his roommates has lived with him before, and since this problem has happened in two separate locations with two people I suspect they are truly the issue, even when they blame their counterparts.)
2. My second complaint for him is that his common area often smells of musk and as feminine as this sounds man stink (because both of them work out on a constant basis, I do too but I don’t like to wallow in my filth as they frequently do. i.e. Making food without cleaning up, watching TV and sitting around, stretching, or even crashing on the couch.) making it awful to sit in for  a long period of time, I have never spent more than an hour inside of his apartment because of this.
3. His family is heavily dependent on him and I feel that would become problematic if we were to move in together. Some examples would be, on the few times that he has visited them he has gone into the negative bank accounts feeding his brothers and sisters (who are around the same age as us, perfectly able to take care of themselves). He has also allowed his brother to live with him multiple days on a couple occasions for various reasons, and as a person who pays rent and am very avid about personal privacy I don’t want people staying over for long stints at a time especially for free, and for insight on myself, my brother asked to live with me for a week while he was on vacation and I absolutely refused without hesitation. He also frequently lends money and pays bills for his relatives which although I have never heard of him not being able to pay his important bills does worry me, like if I had to pick up the slack every once in a while on any bill. As a final insight to financial, this is his first time actually having to pay a rent and utilities as his previous housing was paid for through school and loans.

Some background information on my relationship with my girlfriend, we have broken up a couple times before (I was actually going to write a post about this but the housing is more important right now). 
The reasons I do not want to live with my Girlfriend are as follows:
1.	We already spend quite a lot of time together and although we have been dating for two years I’m not really ready to hang out with her for 16 hours plus, even though we currently rotate sleeping at one another’s houses. As I am typically a home body, we being around each other constantly would mean doing an activity frequently. 
2.	I recently found out that I make nearly double her in net income, and all of my bills actually are around 1.2 times her monthly income. I also found out that she has been receiving support through loans and school to pay for her housing and has very few bills, and that any new place we would live at would probably be money out of her pocket.
3.	Due to the rockiness of our relationship I’m not committed to signing any lease with her as if we were to break up again one of us would be out of house and home and seeing as in our current location I’m very far from my relatives I would have to leave the city, my job, and school in order to have a place to stay, and as I’m nearly done with school I definitely wouldn’t be happy.
4.	She likes to spend money very frequently i.e. eating out, doing activities that cost money, and I tend to be very frugal as I actively seek activities that don’t cost money. 
5.	Common law marriage is very loose in my state and I don’t want to accidently end up married to her.
Further background information, I met them both at the same time, because of the previous rocky relationship issues they don’t really talk to each other, to the point of I don’t mention her name when around him.
In conclusion I don’t want to hurt either of their feelings and I have been given a May 1st ultimatum for a decision by my Girlfriend (so she knows where she’s going to stay). 

My question is who should I live with, if i live with either of them at all? Also how do I tell whoever I dont live with why I am not living with them?


**TL;DR** My GF and my Best friend both want to move in with me separately and I am worried about either becoming the financial grounds or being out of house and home. Need advice.

7252,Breakups,1r37e2,"Hey everyone,
  I have been with my girlfriend for about three years now and we have been dating since high school. When we met I had a pretty bad drug addiction and was a mess. I still have no idea why she wanted to go out with me, but she did everything that she could to help me. Our relationship was filled with passion and it was the only thing that I really cared about since we spent every day together. Eventually when it was time to go off to university, I was going to go across the country while she stayed back home. I wound up dropping out within the first week or two and left to go home. Between withdrawal and missing her, I couldn't manage to stay, especially for something serious like college. I did manage to apply and be accepted into the same college with scholarship so it worked out pretty well and I didn't miss my fall semester. However, I wound up having to stop taking classes in the spring so I could get clean. During this whole time she was really supportive and we spent the next year and a bit as always, which was very much in love. 

  This past semester has been hard since her parents put a lot of pressure on her to work ridiculous hours and get good grades. I am sure that I probably was not helping by wanting to see her, but it just started to feel like we were missing something. I felt like I was stuck in a situation where if I tried to get her to see me it would seem like I was pressuring her, but if I did not, then we would drift further apart. Up until about a week ago, she had given me no reason to fear that we would ever break up, and then all of a sudden she said that she wanted to be alone. I know most people have unrealistic views about love when they are young, but this has been a relationship that we have had for a huge amount of our lives. I feel like I never had a chance to try and make things better. And it is not like things were bad at all, it was just a rough spot in which she was faced with a lot of pressure. 

  I don't know if there is anything that I can do to make things work or not. I am having a hard time accepting the fact that I had no chance or warning or anything. She really did mean everything to me and each time we have talked since she has been crying like crazy. What does any of this mean?

Im 20M. She is 22F. Asia. Generally conserved culture. We are getting along great and we both like each other a lot. So not exactly my girlfriend yet but we've talked about commitment and right now its just a matter of timing. You can say that we have been in an unofficial relationship for about 1 month. 

I found out (through her, actually) that she watches porn. Dont get me wrong, i dont find anything wrong with porn, generally. 

However as a guy who has watched porn (i still do, but less as well as less attached to it), i feel that sometimes its easy to just get trapped and very attached to porn. As well as get influenced by it. I feel porn can also set up for unrealistic expectations in real life. 

I have many confusing questions and feelings in my head right now. I know i shouldn't be having them but they just cloud my head and make me feel down. Neither of us are virgins. 

- She's getting off on other things...that dont involve me?
- Im not the best endowed. Average at best...
- Im not sure what she expects, that the porn might have warped her perception...or increased her expectations 
- Im afraid i cant give her what she wants

I know these stem from my insecurities. But i cant help but feel this way. I am aware that females may feel the same way about guys. But reverse the roles and im feeling so confused. I have never been in such a situation. 

We arent exactly in the position to discuss such indepth topics even though we touched upon the general topic by accident. Id like to ask her and clarify but we cant do that for the next month or two. Im not even sure if its something to clarify or just myself being less insecure about the whole thing.

118692,Relationships,1hsfev,"I will try my best to summarize this in the shortest way possible, but there are a lot of details so here we go!

I met my boyfriend in college, I have changed substantially over the past four years.  I have developed a lot of extreme passions throughout my years of college  My boyfriend shares none of those passions with me, and that's fine for the most part.  However, he has not developed any new passions over the years.   When we met we shared one thing in common: video games.  I still play video games, but mostly 3ds games casually.  He plays GW2 constantly (this is the only thing he is truly passionate about).  Every day.  For over 6 hours.  I have accepted this as something he is not going to change.  This is not really the hardest part of our relationship though.

Onto the sex issue.  I have an extremely low libido.  This is mostly due to the 8+ years of sexual abuse I faced as a child.  I have PTSD attacks every time I have sex.  (Yes, I've seen a counselor.) The only time I can orgasm is if I fantasize about being a different person in a different place having sex with someone else.  I have sex with him because he has an extremely high libido, but I almost never enjoy it.  I feel used most of the time, and he doesn't seem to care much.  Lately, I hate being touched, and I am disgusted by sex.  I am just not attracted to him anymore.  He is close to being obese, and I do weightlifting and consider myself pretty fit.  He shows no interest in doing any activities with me and I have suggested several (even just walking around).

Next Issue.  I am stuck in this relationship.  I can't find a job, and I need one more semester to graduate so I can get an actual job.  He makes a shitload of money as a programmer.  I have $10 in my bank account and wouldn't be able to even feed myself or rent an apartment.  I get no support from my family.  My abusive step-father is in jail, my biological dad is an asshole basically, and my mother is dealing with my sister's cancer and relies on government support.  I also don't really have any friends who can support me at the moment.  I also have chronic disorders that require me to have some sort of insurance which I can't afford either.  I am still paying off hospital bills.

In summation, the main reasons why our relationship is not working out is the following:


1. He sucks at communicating.  I attempt communication, but he will outright avoid conflict every time.  He has not changed this in over four years.  Whenever I am upset or depressed (I have dysthymia) he changes the subject instead of trying to help me.  He also has a ""don't care attitude"" about almost everything.  Even when I express my suicidal thoughts due to depression, he is never alarmed.  


2. No attraction on my end.  There's just nothing there anymore.


3. Different life goals that don't connect well.  I want to live in the country with a garden and work in the woods--he wants to live in the city working in video games.  He wants me to be a housewife and raise kids and that just isn't what I want.  


4. We have no common interests anymore.  He wants me to play more video games but doesn't want to partake in any of my interests.


5. Refusal/denial to change.  We've done couples therapy.  I've tried my hardest.  He is mostly the same person from when I first met him.  I have changed and sacrificed a lot for him, but I don't see him doing the same.


6. He relies on me for way too much.  I am his emotional support, I am literally his only friend, his ""mom"" (I clean his house and cook dinner), and also his lover.  The only thing he doesn't rely on me for is financial support.  I can't handle this much stress and I yearn to be my own person again.


I have no idea how to end this 4 year relationship.  I have been with other people, but they weren't true relationships--just stuff in high school.  I feel like I will have a hard time finding someone who will love me because of my mental illnesses and all of my physical illnesses (I have chronic disorders all throughout my gastro system).  Whenever I ask advice from my friends I just get ""wow, that sucks.""  I am at a loss of what to do at this point.  The only thing that keeps me from being suicidal is my sister going through cancer and my parrot.

My boyfriend and I have lived in a shared house for almost two years and really like it. We were good friends with one of the housemates, but a year into our tenancy, she started taking everything out on my boyfriend and blaming him for really trivial things (like saying he was taking food when he wasn't or going nuts on him for accidentally taking fruit he thought was his from our shared cupboard when she would do the exact same and then tell his for HER it was an accident, but for him it is clearly deliberate). She and our current housemate got very close and I feel like it set this weird precedent for blaming my BF for everything because it is convenient. 

Anyway, the new housemate (the one in question) has always been very messy to the point that everyone has had discussions with him (including the neighbor, though its not his business, the other housemate, me, the old flatmate, the cleaner, etc.). I mean his room is vile, but he goes under the idea that it is his room...which is fine because I don't live there.

Anyway, the day before yesterday, my boyfriend and I were having some people over, which he knew about. In the common area, he had left several empty and half-drunk beer bottles, takeaway containers, half eaten food, a full cigarette ash tray and the back door wide open. Since I had made it my mission to clean for the day, I ended up cleaning up his mess and didn't say anything. 

In the middle of it, he asked if our cleaners came and I told him no, that I was cleaning for our get together. He said okay and then when I went in the kitchen, I saw he had dripped cereal all over the place. 

In the evening, the boys were both frantically looking for things that I had cleaned up that they had left lying around. My boyfriend kept asking me where some of his things were (he found them eventually) and the housemate kept asking after his cigarettes, which I hadn't touched. I threw away an empty carton of cigarettes, but not a whole pack. However, he got it in his head that I threw away the cigarettes and wanted me to go through the trash for him, which I did but told him I had thrown away a mashed up empty carton. He then told me, ""Do you have any idea how much that cost?"" And then I kind of lost it on him and told him if he wants to make sure his cigarettes don't get moved, he needs to clean up after himself and put them away. 

Afterward, I apologized for shouting, but told him he needed to clean up a bit more because it is getting ridiculous. He then tried to tell me he cleans up after himself all of the time, it is only my boyfriend who doesn't. 

Today, I get up and find his energy drinks (he only drinks them) strewn around, cigarette butts, a half full tray of cigarette ash, three or four empty cans of beer and empty take out boxes in the living room. My boyfriend was with me last night, plus he doesn't drink or smoke and I heard my housemate get the take out (my bf is also on a diet and a tight budget so I don't think he chipped in for the takeout). 

This makes me want to take a picture of it and be like, ""Oh, you always clean up after yourself?"" 


What can I do? I am not the house mom/maid just because I'm the only female. (I consider my bf not picking up after himself a kind of separate issue which he and I are working on.)

**tl;dr
Have gf. Want to escalate physical parts of relationship. Advances have been rejected. Halp with communication?**

A little background: I've been hanging out with this girl, who used to be just a crush, for about 3 months now. I suppose by high-school-standards we're officially a couple, but neither of us feel that compelled to label it, so we just continue to go out, and we agree on exclusivity. 

Most things are great! I was surprised at how receptive she was to me approaching and pursuing her, which in itself was very out of character for me. I tend to fall on the introverted side of that scale. And in my honest opinion she's ever so slightly out of my league.

Anyways, we do couple-type-things all the time and most dates end with a goodnight hug and kiss. We cuddle and watch netflix pretty often too. However, the few times that I've tried to escalate from just a peck on the lips to something more intimate like making out, she's always pulled away before I have. Very quickly actually. I don't think I'm being overly forward because we see eachother quite often, and for high school standards we're moving at a really slow pace. It's not a huge issue. I'm ok with slow, as long as there's progress. But it's happened maybe 2 or 3 times and it really discourages me from trying anything again.

She's not my first gf, so I've been able to escalate things before successfully. And I'm certain that she's into me, so attraction isn't the problem. Also, my breath smells fine haha I don't think hygiene's the issue. However, she's never been in a relationship before so it's possible that inexperience is making her a bit shy? Maybe she's uncomfortable with it? Not sure.

So this post is me trying to be proactive and not let this problem fester. I want to communicate effectively about why she might be rejecting my advances but I'm not sure how to word what I'm feeling. (It's also entirely possible that I'm just misreading signals) But can anyone help with how I should approach this? Anyone know another reason she might be acting this way? At this point I want to try one more time before I speak up.

We randomly talked about strip clubs a month back. I am personally uncomfortable with my significant other visiting them. I completely respect and support couples who like to go to them, whether together or separately, and just feel like it's not for me. I told him I wouldn't be in a relationship where my boyfriend went to them.


He said he's been to them (before we were together; I totally understand that and it's not a problem for me that he's been before), and he thinks they're fun/funny, but it's not something he goes to on his own and he's only been a handful of times. 


A couple of weeks ago, some of his brother's friends visited from their country and they all went out. He called me the next day, saying he was DD and they visited a dance club we both like, and even though a girl asked him to dance he turned her down. I said I was glad they had fun, and it was really sweet of him to be respectful, though I hadn't asked him not to dance with girls. Clubs are for dancing, and while I wouldn't be super thrilled about it happening while I wasn't there, as long as there's no serious groping, I'd expect him to dance during a guys' night out.


This weekend I made some stupid joke about strip clubs, and he suddenly became very vehement about it, saying that I was taking away his freedom and that I didn't trust him. I was pretty surprised by it, but reiterated that I wasn't comfortable with it. He said he liked to take his friends when they're visiting from their country for the shock factor (since supposedly they don't have many there), and it wasn't any different from going to a club because girls wear so little there, too (I tried to point out that it was, but he didn't agree). He said he doesn't touch anyone so it shouldn't be an issue.

I told him that if he felt strongly it was infringing on his freedom, then I respected that he wanted to go to them but I wasn't comfortable being in a relationship. We technically broke up for ~5 minutes while I gathered my things, then he came to me and said he wouldn't go to them, but made it clear that he saw it as an indication I'd take away his freedom later. He also said he hated himself that we'd break up over strip clubs, because he found them sleazy and didn't like them anyway.


We kinda patched things up, threw a big world cup party on Sunday, and things almost went back to normal. I've just been feeling uneasy about it all, and really guilty for supposedly limiting him (I strongly encourage his guys' nights out, wanting him to go to bars and clubs and relax because his work is so hectic). I also remembered how adamantly he insisted he wanted to go only when his friends came in from out of country. So I called him up, and apologized for asking, but wanted to know if he went to one with his friends two weekends ago. He said yes, very flippantly, and asked what was the matter.


Long conversation, but I expressed I was hurt that he knew I considered it a deal breaker yet didn't tell me when he went to one a couple weeks later. He said he didn't need to, and he never promised that he wouldn't go to one at that first conversation (which I acknowledged right off), and said he was frustrated I expected him to tell me he had gone to one between the two conversations.


I guess I don't know that I trust his word, or rather, trust him to bring up things we should talk about. I totally get that he didn't want to tell me because of what it meant to me, but after I confronted him about it, he turned it into my problem. He never apologized for not telling me.


Should I be concerned? He asked me not to talk to my friends about it, so I honestly don't know. I'm second guessing myself but feel really really uncomfortable about everything. 


Thank for reading all of this! Sorry it's so long.

I know this isn't your average /r/relationships post, but I really would like some insight from people. It would mean a lot. A female friend and I have been hanging out on and off since last year. We are openly flirtatious with each other, and we spend hours talking about anything. I've had feelings for her for a little while now, but there is absolutely nothing I would do to jeopardize our relationship, just because it means so much to me.

All that being said, I just want to know so badly if she's into me. Personally, it seems like she is, but I could just be being bias out of hope/desire. That's what I'm hoping you guys could help me with.

A week ago, she went on vacation up north to visit family and some friends. One night, she took a couple bong rips, and started texting me. She was saying things like, I miss you (that in particular quite a bit), you're so cute, you know, stuff like that. And then she said something that made me feel great, but at the same time, confused. How come you have never made a move on me before? As I read it, I was overcome with joy, and felt great. But at the same time, I knew she was high, more or less, and I didn't want her to do/say anything she didn't mean or did not want to say. So I told her we should talk more in the morning.

Next morning, she admitted she had been pretty high (although I have a sneaking suspicion she may have just been saying that because she didn't know how I feel.) I don't know where to go from here. 

There have been tell-tale signs throughout her friendship of which you could make the argument that we're both into each other. That being said, I don't want to go about this the wrong way and screw up one of the most important friendships I have. So what does the community think? Does she have a thing for me? Should I act on my feelings? I would love any advice/words of wisdom, as I'm in such a confused place. Thanks :)

41284,Relationships,2a64x4,"I love my boyfriend. I really really do. He's not perfect, but I think he is wonderful. He knows about everything, but never makes me feel stupid. He's funny and makes me laugh. He's kind and listens to me. We have many of the same interests and always have something to talk about. We are on the same page for all major beliefs and life decisions. I've never felt this way about anyone before. I find him incredibly attractive, personality and looks, and even 2.5 years later he makes me weak in the knees. The only issue we really have is with our sex life - he only wants to have sex once a week, while I'd be ready to go anytime.

But at the same time I am so desperately unhappy. I work a shitty fast food job to pay for rent and school. I'm so depressed. I have few close friends and I don't really talk to my family any more. I used to self-harm and I worry about starting again. If my boyfriend didn't live with me I would. The only thing that is stopping me now is that he would see the cuts.

I feel so STUCK. It feels like I need to make this drastic change in my life. I tried looking for another job and I had a few interviews, but nothing worked out. I still have a year and a half left of school so I'm not qualified for a real job yet - although I don't think I want to even work in my field. I kind of want to start my own business - one of those Etsy shops selling indie make up and/or homemade cards. But I feel like it's lame and I won't succeed. 

I have such a hard time talking about stuff to people. I was verbally abused by my father and lead to believe that I am worthless. He didn't like me to talk and if I showed emotion it was weak. I have a hard time trusting people and I'm scared of being abandoned. 

I feel like my relationship needs more emotional intimacy (is that a real term?). I want to share things with my boyfriend, especially how I feel right now, because I think it would take away a lot of the stress. But I'm worried that he will think I am unhappy with him and I'm worried that he might not want me anymore. Sometimes he says he feels like I shut him out. I get upset when he doesn't want to have sex - not because of physical reasons - but because I really connect together sex and intimacy. Intellectually, know that he doesn't want to have sex because he's tired or whatever, but it feels like it is because he doesn't love me. I'm trying to work on this.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is almost perfect. I feel stuck and unhappy in my life. I have issues with communication because of a verbally abusive Dad. I don't know how to communicate my unhappiness to my boyfriend without him feeling like I am unhappy with him. I don't know how to communicate my unhappiness at all.

18076,Infidelity,2vtu2f,"Let me me blunt: I made some mistakes a while ago, years ago. I never slept with anyone else. I never engaged in any sort of sex act. But, I acted inappropriately, unfaithfully. In a sense, in a broad definition of the word, I cheated. And I've been trying to pick up the pieces ever since. 

Well, you all say, you don't just FALL onto someone's dick by accident. I never fell on anyone's dick, but let me tell you, I came close. I stumbled onto some lips. I bumped into some hands. (I think - I've repressed it for so long, and I was so drunk during some of these episodes, that I'm not sure anymore of the details of what transpired.) How is this possible, you ask? Well, for one thing, I was raised with no model of a relationship and no concept of the proper way for a man to treat a woman. I equated sex with love, and my goal every time I went out was to get laid because to me, that meant acceptance. That meant someone cared. Years of this bred a sort of autopilot function where I pretty much went along with any attention I was given because I craved it. If I felt he was interested, my brain would shut off, and I'd just roll with it. I didn't know how to say no, because I didn't know how to value myself. Add alcohol to this mix, and the autopilot function takes over. Did I have free will? Was I capable of making decisions? Yes, I was. But those muscles atrophied, or rather, they never fully developed. My Pavlovian response was yes. 

It took a very long time, and a very understanding man to help me get over this warped way of thinking and destructive behavior pattern. I had to learn how to respect myself. I had to learn how to command that respect. I had to learn that a man worthy of my time will want me for more than just sex. I had to learn to not be cheap, to not be impulsive. I had to teach my brain, and then my mouth, to say no. I am now careful to not do anything that would even give the appearance of, or put me in a position where I could consider messing around.

I want to say I've come a long way. I think it will never happen again. I even came clean to my partner (I did not give him details, just the general confession that I was inappropriate with other men; he did not want details). Somehow, coming clean felt worse. His willingness to work it out and forgive me made me feel even more worthless. I can't remember the last time I had a day where it didn't linger in the back of my mind, casting a dark shitty cloud over my otherwise wonderful life. I've gone to therapy. The therapist said I need to put it in the past. I'm trying. 

But ultimately, this idea that once a cheater always a cheater and that anyone who cheats does not deserve a second chance is engrained in my brain. I know what Reddit thinks of cheaters: assholes, sluts, horrible people. My boyfriend gave me a second chance and I can't fucking take it because I can't get over myself. Am I wrong to try to shake off this scarlet letter I've put on myself? Am I wrong for trying to hold on to the relationship I want to deserve? 

Is it possible that instead of being a monstrous slutty succubus, I'm a human being who made some mistakes, feels insanely remorseful, changed her ways, was forgiven, and can somehow move on and have a good life with the man I love?

31287,Breakups,3dg3a2,"I apologize ahead of time for the length. It's nothing earth shattering, it's probably really boring, I'm just feeling really shitty and need to write this down and get it out of my head.


I've been dating my (ex)gf for two years. We became a couple about a month after we met. For the first year things were amazing. We were happy whenever we were together (which was often) and could enjoy each other's company doing anything. My friends liked her, her friends liked me. The sex was great; she had more libido than me. We cuddled every night and woke up still cuddling in the morning. I was so happy. We were so happy. 


A little over a year ago we moved in together, and that's when things started to go downhill. We live in a big city, so rent is expensive. Some stuff happened that had both of us looking for apartments at the same time, so we moved in because it was cheap(er) and easy.


I've always had good relationships with roommates so wasn't worried, but things started to get worse slowly. 


We never had exactly the same interests, or opinions, but who does? Previously it was never an issue, but after moving in together we started to get in fights more often (we never used to fight). But everyone fights, so ok, whatever, I thought.


Our sex life started going down hill. First the kinky sex went away. Then the vanilla sex started dwindling. Any intimacy followed. Cuddling? No. Handholding? No. Hugs? No. I had to ask before hugging her, because she told me it felt like I was invading her personal space... she used to be genuinely happy to hug me. This hurt a lot. Holding her, hugging, cuddling, was the best part of my day/week/whatever. I felt whole. Now I felt empty. When we did have sex, or cuddle, or anything, it felt forced. It wasn't the same.


I was confused but just tried to give her space. She was stressed out at work (she started a new job a few months before we moved in together) and I thought she'd get through it. On a few occasions, she'd get really really mad at me. Screaming fits... over weird things she suddenly seemed to care intensely about but had never even mentioned before.


And things didn't get better. More fights. Sex once a month, maybe? In the last few months of the relationship. And it was just bad. If she asked me how she looked and I said an outfit she was wearing looked sexy, she would wince. Sometimes I'd try to hug her and she'd recoil.


A few months ago we tried going on a trip to a remote island get out of town and away from stress, and it was great. But once we were back in town everything was the same again. I could tell she wasn't happy but I didn't know what to do. Fighting died down a bit, but only because it seemed like she stopped caring.


The thing was, we still had lots of good times even with all this. We ate dinner together all the time, and she'd be disappointed if I had to work late and miss it. We watched TV together, went to events, concerts, museums, etc, and it was fun. We'd talk about moving across the country, about interior design and life goals years down the line. But at the same time it started to feel like we were just friends, not in a relationship.


I'm confused because this is my longest relationship, by far. I never had dated anyone for more than a few months. But I wasn't happy with 0 intimacy. It dragged on me, made me frustrated. She seemed perfectly content with the lack of intimacy. But there was unhappiness creeping into her more and more the past 6 months.


I'd try to figure out why she was unhappy. Try to cheer her up any way I could. Help her out with work stuff if I could, watch her dog, stop asking her to do things I wanted to do and did more of stuff she wanted. But she was still unhappy.


All this built up and we first broke up a month ago, and we were both devastated. Neither of us could stop crying for days, so we got back together. We said it was a shot in the arm and that we'd both work harder but really it only lasted a week until things went back to how they had been (though there were no fights, there was just a general unhappy vibe in the apartment).


On this past friday we had a great night. She had a good week at work. We went to a bar that reminded us of our island vacation. We laughed a lot. We only had a couple drinks, and came back to the apartment early. We were both wide awake. It had been a month since we were intimate... but she still didn't want to. I said if you don't want to now, when will you ever? She said it's not that she doesn't want to have sex, it's that she doesn't want to have sex with me... this hurt a lot to hear.


We broke up again on Monday night. She's not happy. She needs to be alone and work on herself right now. She can't give me everything I want in a relationship and she can see her unhappiness making me unhappy. She doesn't want a relationship, basically. it's not you, it's me stuff. She says she still loves me.


Now I sit here alone in our bedroom. I took the day off from work because I can't think straight. She did as well, so she could look for a new apartment. It's really happening this time.


I have so many emotions. I feel sad, because I still love her but I can't make her happy. 


I feel awful, because she knows me better than anyone and then just decides nope. And it's not like I did anything specific, or she did anything specific, or any big event happened. The person who knows me best in the world just doesn't want me anymore.


I feel like an ass, because I wonder if I'm over valuing intimacy? What is a relationship anyway? Am I wrong to want to cuddle, to hold hands, to kiss her or hug her when I leave for work or get home? Should I have just gotten past it?


I feel mad. Like she just used me and is done. One day she wants a boyfriend, the next she doesn't, goodbye.


But then she still wants to be friends. But I can't now. I'm not sure when I can. But I look at her and I still love her. I still want to hold her. I am crying just thinking about it. To be around her and know she doesn't want what I want hurts, and then makes me feel guilty.


I thought we were a team, together taking on the world. And now we're not.


I can rationally, logically, see that it doesn't really make sense for us to be in a relationship. She doesn't want to be intimate with me, and that doesn't seem to be changing. She wants to be alone. We just don't make good roommates, apparently. I always say you don't necessarily need a reason to break up, but you should always have a reason to stay together. And I guess we just ran out of good reasons to stay together.


But it hurts so much. All of that logic means nothing. We were best friends. She's such a part of my life. I remember how happy we were a year ago and I just want it back. Even more I'm crushed and I just want to hang out with my best friend and I can't because it just hurts to even look at her.


How do others deal with this?


I keep thinking about what is a relationship? is it just friendship with intimacy and commitment? I don't even know anymore.

I used to not get bothered by being rejected; but as I do more and more, I have started to wonder if I'm going to be one of those guys who is alone for his whole life. And at this point my confidence has hit rock bottom when it comes to relationships. After my last rejection its gotten to the point where I just look at a person I think is attractive and tell myself stupid stuff like Stop looking, you already know they aren't interested.. 

The thing is though; I like myself, I think I'm attractive, I go to clubs/groups (which I will admit these groups are almost all guys because of my interests), I run half-marathons, marathons and ultras  and excersize regularly, I'm satisfied with my school grades, I go to a psychologist and she tells me that I seem stable (except that I have bad anxiety), I have several good friends and I have a set of hobbies.

  This bothered my current girlfriend when we started dating so I told my friend who understood where my girlfriend was coming from so we stopped talking. A year and a half later my friend texts me happy birthday and we text and catch up a bit and she mentions she might be in town and would like to meet my girlfriend. I pitch the idea to my girlfriend (thinking a year and a half gained me some trust and she would be willing to meet my friend to get to know her and understand there's nothing romantic between us) but she shut down. She asked to look through my phone and got mad about how I text my friend versus how I text my girlfriend, which I understood because it feels like a routine with her just telling me about her job. 



The main problem is my girlfriend can't deal with me having a female friend and I don't see why I should have to cut off one of the few friends I talk to. I've never given my girlfriend a reason to not trust me but she's been cheated on in the past which doesn't help. I Just don't think its heathy for me to cut off friends because she's a girl.

Summer 2013, started my current equally boring admin job and my quality assessor was this blonde 30-something year old that seemed, initially, in a whole different pond to this small fish. 

But a few months passed and we found ourselves talking about shared interests and such - she studied film at university and I'm a huge film snob/junkie (delete as you feel appropriate) and we'd both work late and talk about new releases, classic films and generally shoot the shit about a whole load of other stuff, including her string of dysfunctional exes, my casual, half-arsed attempts at dating etc.

So a few months pass and it's *CLICHE ALERT* one of the four work Christmas parties we had that year (shit gets complicated in an office with two different kinds of temp staff spread over 9 departments) and at one of them we were the last two stop-outs, grooving away on a sticky dancefloor. We step outside for a cigarette and she starts telling me how I'm the only person she can connect to at work and how she wished she'd met me years ago and all the sort of shit I've learned, over the years, to file under ""stuff drunk, horny people say to each other on a semi-regular basis"" and we sort of make out for a while out of boredom before calling it a night.

That Christmas her long-term live-in boyfriend proposes to her, so I'm like, ""Nothing's on the cards from here on out,"" but in late February we wind up last two on the dancefloor in the same place at a different work event (I guess we just both handle our liquor pretty well) and she starts talking about all the stuff she said before Christmas and how she actually meant it and all she thinks about is how she should have said no to her boyfriend and yadda, yadda, yadda. So we make out some more and there's a bit of handsy nonsense too, but nothing more. This time I was a lot more drunk than the first. Again, we both go home.

Skip to July. She's now my manager. She's getting married in 2 weeks' time and I've just moved house for about the billionth time this year. I get a text from her like, ""Hey, you live kind of close to me now, you have to get to know the local watering holes, blah blah"" so we meet up at some awful halfway-refurbished place where all the shots taste watered-down. It's either a Tuesday or Wednesday night but we're drinking pretty hard anyway. It's her setting the pace, not me and in hindsight I suppose she was drinking to build up courage or some shit, but at the time I didn't really think too much about it. We were just talking usual random bullshit about whatever and then she starts talking about what she'd said that second time and I'm nodding and sort of three-quarters listening to what she has to say.

She turns to me in this absolute shithole of a bar and goes, ""I want you to be my last. I want you to be the last person I fuck before I get married."" I start having palpitations and my whole upper body goes numb and cold, that super-nervous reaction I've only ever known before going on stage to perform. And I'm sitting there, trying to digest this shit, and she's just looking at me with this half-horny, half-scared expression that I've never seen before or since, and well, we did it that night, at her place, while her boyfriend was in some ski resort in France.

And then two weeks later she marries the guy. Fine. I get that. I should probably mention here that he's got a really well-paid stable job and stuff and offers her security that I won't get close to for years without some major lucky break. 

But ever since she got back from their honeymoon she's been calling me whenever he's out of town for work (which is roughly twice a month) and, mostly against my better judgment, I've been going over or inviting her round because honestly, it's the best sex I've ever had and while the guilt doesn't make it better, it doesn't seem to make it any worse either. I told my housemate what was going on and ever since he found out he's been putting a lot of pressure on me to stop seeing her. What really scares me more than anything is the possibility of getting her pregnant, to be honest.

Is my moral compass completely fucked? Should I listen to my housemate? Is it my problem if she wants to fuck up her marriage? I need help, reddit, and please give reasons and examples and stuff, I get enough of the 'THIS IS WRONG, THIS IS JUST PLAIN WRONG' from my housemate.

Also, I know females doing the proposing isn't a frequent thing, but we have talked about marriage, and though he said he has no problem proposing to me, he has mentioned how lovely it would be if I popped the question instead.

The only issue is that about a month ago I told my boyfriend I loved him in a moment of giddinness.

He is very affectionate and has said he really likes me but never those three magic words.

I've had emotionally abusive relationships in the past so it's important to me to have some kind of security in my relationships.

I want to bring it up but I don't want him to say it because he feels he has to.

97687,Relationships,3513r1,"Hi, I've never posted to Reddit before! My boyfriend lives in a pretty heavily populated city on the northeast and I've been considering moving in with him after being long-distance for a few months (since January). Our relationship has been rocky but I really love him.

In March my boyfriend half revealed to me that he made out with a good friend of his in June of last year (practically in the middle of our relationship). We've been struggling with being monogamous lately. I've given my opinion that I think an open relationship would be better for both of us. Since we started dating I've had times when I drunkenly make out with other people (mainly girls) and have thoughts about being with others, which has convoluted our conversations and turned our relationship bitter. He won't let us be in an open relationship because he said ""you'll just hook up with more people than me."" Because he hasn't made many friends in the new area where he lives. He's even gone to the point of getting sick and not eating for a couple of days when he found out that I knew he cheated. I felt emotionally betrayed, humiliated and utterly disgusted so I didn't want to care.

I also feel like I must admit that his friends here (he used to live here and moved recently) have been making moves on me. I don't necessarily push them away, but my boyfriend found that one of our mutual friends has been trying to sleep with me. We haven't slept together, but my boyfriend has been getting really pushy and tense because of this. He asks me where I am all the time, he asks me who I sit next to when we go out to bars, and even who I talk to. It's gotten a little ridiculous, but I get where he is coming from.

Our relationship has really been amazing though. He has opened me up emotionally and I've never met someone like him in my life. I really want things to work and I can see him being with me in the future, but the way this is going is making me uneasy. What I'm really looking for is advice on what to do. My boyfriend seems insecure about the way our relationship is. How can I fix this?
