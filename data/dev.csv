23026,Dating,1y4qly,"Tonight the girl of my dreams broke it off because she doesn't see her feelings ever growing. I needed time to heal so I kicked her out tonight because she's been practically living with me. But when she was getting all her things I took it back and told her to stay until the morning and then she can go home then. As I'm typing this I'm tearing up and it hits me hard knowing that she's not going to be there when I come home from work anymore, and that she's not going to be a part of my life.

We had everything in common and I felt like I had finally found the one after a long history of unhappy relationships. My heart is breaking and I could really use your guys' support.

14813,Relationships,1kmenz,"My gf and I have been in this relationship for a little over 10 months, we both soon turn 18 (13, and 16'th of october), things are fine for the most part, at least she says it is. We are both in (not sure what it's called in english) in a school for 16-19 year olds. I live a lot closer to the school than she does, and up untill now I didn't think it was bugging her that we spent most of our time together at my house. To me it is simply easier since I live close to school, to just go to my place instead of going to hers and having to get up a lot earlier, to get to school.


She just called me and we had an hour of talk, where she was crying for the most part. I had a tough time dealing with this because she kept repeating herself, and basically the only thing she kept saying was that I should come over to her place. I am over at her place in the weekends, if I can, because I get headaches if I have to exercise  an hour after I get up (she bike 10 km to school, and I live 300 meters from school).


TL;DR: Am I being unfair, for saying that I only want to be at her place in the weekends/ days where I can meet late at school? I really want to do good in school, and I really can't focus for the most part of the day, if I exersise early in the morning. (I do exersise regurlaly)

EDIT: She was constantly hinting at me not caring about her. Example, she said that if she was me she would knock off the homework I was doing prior to the phone call, and go to her place.

Her: Okay then. bye

15597,Breakups,22fmpv,"I have found myself trying to find a reason to break up with my boyfriend of 3 years.  I really want to break up with him but am having a hard time finding the courage to do so.  I know that I need to do what I need to do for myself to be happy, but I still don't want to hurt him because he is just such a nice guy and we've lived with each other for 2+ years.

He makes me dinners, treats me with respect, is an all-around very very nice and loving family guy.  However, we've had some fights in the past because we don't have that much in common.  To the point we have a hard time finding the right movie or music to watch/listen to because our likes are so different. We've gotten used to it, but I feel like this has ruined some of my attraction to him, while he's learned to adjust. I've also felt weird about the way we communicate -- it's hard to explain, but I just feel like the vibe we have together doesn't feel right when we communicate.  I don't think he notices this (which would make breaking up even harder to explain).  I think one thing that attracted me to him in the first place was that he was such a downright nice guy, loyal, faithful, family man, etc.  He really doesn't want to hurt a fly.  Contrast that to my last relationship where my bf cheated on me continuously and you might see how we ended up together.

Lately, I've been so (uninterested?) that I've been turning down his advances for sex.. I'll sometimes avoid the bedroom until he goes to sleep just because I don't want to have sex with him.  It hurts me to do this to him, but at the same time I just don't feel that interested. I find him physically attractive but my mind seems to have a disconnect.

7053,Non-Romantic,2jzc40,"Ok, I live in a shared house with two other housemates, we aren't close, we all have our own lives but get along ok. We split the rent three ways, the bills three ways, each buy our own groceries, alternate buying toilet paper and washing powder, etc.

I come from an abusive household, I moved across the country to try and get my life together, and it's been going ok. Recently I heard that my younger brother (18) who since I left has been the target of my parents emotional abuse wanted to leave, but he was broke and had no chance of moving out. I wanted to let him move in with me to give him a chance of rebuilding his life. We were never really close, our parents used to purposely set us against each other, but I'm going to push him to find a job and find his own place, and living with me will give him a place to start doing that without being harrassed by our parents. I run this past my housemates, and they agree, and so I send my brother some money to buy a plane ticket over here.

Here's where the conflict starts - I don't earn a lot of money, just enough to get by, I can pay the rent and bills on time and afford groceries, but I don't have a lot left over afterwards. I knew that when my brother comes things were going to be more tight.

He was moving into my room so I assumed that the rent would still be split 3 ways, since he isn't taking up a room, and that the power and water bills would now be split 4 ways, since he is going to be using another person's worth of power and water, and I'd have to pay both his share and mine while he got on his feet. I thought this was reasonable.

However, he's flying in next week, and my apparently my housemates assumed that the rent was now going to be split 4 ways since there's four people in the house. I said no, because he wasn't taking up a whole room, we were sharing the room, so it should still be split 3 ways, and they both disagreed. 

We should have talked about it before, but it didn't even cross my mind, and I honestly don't have the money to pay for half the rent (since if we split it into 4, I'll be paying 2 of them, mine and my brothers, 50% as opposed to 33% like I thought).

Could I get some advice from a non-bias source on who's right here? Like I said, I think it's reasonable to now split the power and water bills into 4 since he's going to be using power and water, but not the rent since he's not taking up extra room? 

(We have a two car garage, both my housemates have cars, neither my brother or I can drive so it's not an issue, and my housemates are usually happy to give me a ride if I desperately need one, I usually take public transport though.)

6752,Infidelity,2fikyf,"I don't even know where's the best place to start to be honest with you. Apologies in advance for the rambling.

I'm 22 and a nurse, been at my job for a year. A guy I work with (my bosses boss) was a good friend of mine since around Christmas time. He taught me alot, gave me advice about being a newly qualified nurse and generally just was a nice guy to talk to. A couple of months ago things turned more than friends. He told me he was single and had two children who he saw regularly but he'd separated from their mother a while ago. He told me he really liked me and that despite the age different (he's 39) he wanted to give things a go between us as long as it stayed outside of work.

I loved spending time with him, talking to him for hours and hours, finding out about what a wonderful person he was ... hell I loved him! We went away for the weekend and despite using a condom, I got pregnant. My world started to crumble but he was there to support me, saying he would stand by me regardless of what decision I made. I booked a termination for 2 weeks time to give me time to think about what I really wanted to do. The weekend before the termination he left me saying he couldn't deal with it all and that I shouldn't keep the baby. I was distraught.

I stayed at my friends house for the week as I couldn't bare to be on my own, crying most of the time. He contacted me, apologised and said he would be there for me. I let him back in again. I needed him, he was going through what I was going through.

On the day of the termination he picked me up and we headed over to the clinic together. I went in and asked him one last time what he wanted me to do, he said to get rid of it. I didn't want to do that but knew I was in no position to bring a child into this world on my own. I had the termination. It was the most traumatic thing I've ever been through in my life. I was sedated and can't really remember it but being in agony and so frightened.

After the termination we booked into a hotel and he cuddled me the whole night. Wiped away my tears, made me feel safe and that it was the right decision to make. The next day I went home and attempted to get my life back on track. I went to counselling and despite the unbelievable guilt I felt, I tried to move on.

Two weeks later I'm at work on a night shift and I get a text from him saying that he can't see me anymore. I ask why and he said 'sorry for doing this while you're at work but I have a wife and she knows about you.' To cut a long story short it turns out he was in fact still very much married and his wife is 7 months pregnant. I had no idea. He told me he wanted nothing more to do with me and to not contact him anymore. I was just dumped and left to deal with the aftermath of everything. To live with the fact that I haven't just ruined one life (killing my unborn child) but in fact 3 other lives in the process.

I don't know how my life turned out in this mess. I wasn't planning on falling in love, especially with a married man. I didn't plan to get pregnant nor having to abort my child. I'm just full of guilt and don't know how much more I can live with this all going around in my head.
No one knows, I went through this alone and I know people would judge me if they knew.

I don't know how I can ever live with the fact I'm 'the other woman' How I could ever love or trust anyone again. I didn't even get a proper explanation from him and can't even scream at him for doing this to me because he's blocked my number. How can someone do this? How could I allow this to happen? I'm so disappointed and angry with myself for even getting myself into this situation.

8212,Dating,3i7be9,"I was on Tinder around January when I matched with this girl. Didn't really talk to her until a few months ago (April). Anyways, we got to talking, and she suddenly told me, Let's fuck. I was a little taken aback as I've never done hookups or anything (in fact I've never had sex), and so I played along with her on the phone for that night. We just kind of talk for a little while, she shows interest in coming to my house, and I had a lot going on so I was never available. 

Anyways, I meet some other girl that I would like to start dating (didn't come on as strong as girl 1, liked her more at the time), and so while I invited girl 1 over, I told her that I'm basically seeing that other girl, so she shouldn't get her hopes up for a relationship with me just yet. She said that she was cool with it, we had a few laughs and talked, and then she left. 

Okay, so the whole time I'm trying to talk to girl 2 (turned out to be a bunch of blue balls), girl 1 started sending me nudes of herself, like a lot. I always responded positively to them, and I still retained friendly banter with her. Eventually I call things off with girl 2 (because she acted too busy for me), and unfortunately around this time, girl 1 stops giving me attention. I talk to her some, she responds, but she just stopped talking to me as much. I kind of grew fond for her over this time that I talked to that other girl and, I hate to sound sleazy like this, but I kind of just want to get laid (which seems like what she wanted as well).

21253,Relationships,1p62mo,"My boyfriend and I are both seniors in high school and we've been together for about three or months or so. He's a wonderful boyfriend, and exhibits great qualities that I've otherwise yet to encounter among teenage guys. Basically, he's a keeper. 

We're very close and affectionate and spend a ton of time together; we've met each other's parents, we have the same friends, we live near each other, et cetera. We got to know each other throughout our junior year in a class that we had together--I'd say we have a strong intellectual bond as well. Since we officially became a couple, we have definitely fallen for each other and are both super happy and excited for the months to come.

The only apparent issue is that we're both looking to leave our city for college next fall. It's still early on, and I'm not a strong believer in high school sweethearts. Even though we're great together, I don't think the stress of maintaining a long distance relationship would be worth it in the long run. I can see us getting more attached to each other and considering it down the line, but at this juncture I can't get my mind off of the idea that our entire relationship is for naught, pointless, because it essentially has an expiration date: August (which I know is almost a whole year away... but still).

I know there's a possibility that we'll break up naturally before the end of the academic year but assuming that we don't, the question remains. How do I stop feeling anxious about the future? I'm trying to grasp the whole living in the moment thing, but I'm one to plan and analyze everything.

We've talked about this a few times and he has similar feelings, but we've agreed to try and not worry about it until it's actually time to make any decisions. I don't want to keep bringing it up and be a downer, but it still stresses me out. Any advice? Thanks in advance.

21639,Relationships,33nhlz,"For starters, let me give you an introduction to my girlfriends parents. 

Alice is my girlfriends mom, and Alex is my girlfriends stepdad. Alice divorced with her ex husband and hooked up with her ex husbands cousin (Alex). 
Alice and Alex both net a combined income of somewhere around 150k-170k. They are well off, but they still take child support from ex husband, who is forced to lived in an apartment because of this and has a baby of his own. My girlfriends child support from her dad recently ended because she turned 18, my girlfriend has a brother who is 16 and he actually moved across the country to live with his dad a bout two months ago because he couldn't take his mom Alice anymore. Ex husband still has to pay child support but his son is indecisive about staying or not, that's why he hasn't gone to court to stop paying. 

My girlfriend and her brother have never seen a dime of the child support, they're not even sure where it goes. My theory is that it's wedding money because Alice and Alex are getting married. Anyways, recently senior ball for my girlfriend is coming up (I already graduated). Originally Alice told my girlfriend she would help her pay half for everything, great! Except she hasn't kept her promise, at all. She didn't go half on the dress, she doesn't want to pay half my girlfriends ticket to go but eventually paid for half the ticket. We're not mad that her mom doesn't want to pay for half of the things, we're mad that she lied about going half on EVERYTHING and now pretends like she never said anything. My girlfriend, could have saved money to pay for everything herself if her mom would have just told her that she didn't want to pay any of her prom stuff from the very beginning instead of saying no to paying last minute.
Alice is starting to bring up things like, I kid you not, remember when I paid $80 for your doctors appointment? all I hear is remember when I did things mom are supposed to do? Where's the child support money? She's making my girlfriend pay for her eye appointments, contact lenses, and food sometimes. Again, where is the child support money that is supposed to be going towards all these things? 

Alice is pissed that she has to keep her word so now she's taking aim at me. I told my girlfriend from the very beginning I did not want to go to senior ball, I hated high school and I hated my peers, I do not want to be in a room for 5 hours with people I hate. She finally convinced me to go because I feel bad, she actually cares for this sort of stuff. I still do not want to go at all. My girlfriend told me she'll pay for my $95 ticket to go, okay cool, I'm driving for over 8 hours combined to get to the damn senior ball location. Her mom is pissed that she's paying for my ticket and is saying I need to pay for it, I am invited, I am not going to pay for something I do not give a shit about. I have a trip coming up in 2 months that I need to save for because it's going to be over $1200. Her mom told my girlfriend it's time to move on (break up with me) because I can not afford to pay for the ticket. Mind you, my girlfriend and I added up how much we've spent on each other not too long ago. Over the course of a year she's spent about $250 and I've spent $950. Her mom is essentially calling me a cheap deadbeat, I quit my 40 hour a week job because I'm going to school in August and I want to travel places before starting college. She says I need to get a job or go to school, which is exactly what I am doing. 

My girlfriends real dad is pissed, saying he doesn't pay 80% of his pay checks for her mom to be forcing my girlfriend to pay for her eye prescription, doctor appointment, food. 

I have agreed to pay for my ticket just because I am so angry, I even want to offer to pay for my girlfriends ticket to her mom just so she doesn't have to stress about a $65 ticket. 

Her step dad says my girlfriend shouldn't be mad because Alice has a huge heart, and that she should ask her real dad for money, not her mom, who is receiving child support. Where is the logic? Step dad says my girlfriend shouldn't be angry because she ONLY has her mom to pay for her stuff. Dude, when you fucked over your cousin to date his ex mom you KNEW you were going to have to take responsibly of her two kids, you were going to have to become their father figure and help them with expenses.

5377,Dating,2nr0m8,"So, I got out of a complicated polyamorous relationship a few months ago, and I'm just now starting to get back on my feet.  For fun, I revived my old OKC account and have been talking to a few people.  One of the guys texted me last night and asked me if I wanted to go out tonight.

I'm wary of accepting for a couple of reasons.  One, I don't know this guy.  I don't know if it would even be safe.  Two, I'm not sure I'm actually ready for dating or relationships or anything right now aside from harmless flirting.  Three, I have generalized anxiety disorder and meeting new people is sort of terrifying.

But my therapist has been urging me to get out of my shell and meet new people, so I am wondering if I am being too paranoid.  Should I go out (obviously meeting in a public location and letting my friends know where I am) and try to meet this guy?  Or should I play it safe for now?

13505,Relationships,1q0r00,"I'm currently dating an amazing girl who is a wonderful person. She's ambitious and hard working and has been a solid rock to me throughout a surprisingly rocky year. But recently, I've felt myself putting a wall up in the relationship and it's come to somewhat of a head. We've discussed it and basically I'm going to try and go into this relationship as an open, active, and committed participant.  The one problem that I can't bring up with her is that I still have thoughts of my ex.


A brief history of me and my ex: She and I met in HS and dated for about a year and a half. We broke up because she was moving away after she graduated (she was a year under me but the same age) and it completely devastated me. We stopped talking for a while, but then resumed talking and that eventually led us to getting back together about a year later. She moved back to me and for a summer we were together. But, I put up a wall as the summer went along largely out of fear that this relationship was it and what was I missing out on. She dumped me at the end of that summer because of this and I didn't really fight it. I went abroad, had a blast, came back and immediately missed her and everything was awful. We talked for a bit, including some teary confessions, and then she moved away again.


We talked every once in a while for the next year and a half to two years, with it picking up again after I graduated college and went to law school. We came to the conclusion that we missed each other and visited each other over spring break and summer break. Those two visits are probably among the highlights of my entire life up to this point and I was completely open, committed, vulnerable, and in love. We kept talking but she started to put up a wall and then decided to break things off. I tried to ask why but couldn't really get an answer and put up a small fight, but in retrospect I probably should have fought more. A year and a half later she sent me an email trying to explain why she did what she did, blaming distance and her need to push away good things and being scared. We talked, I said I still had feelings for her and wanted to be with her and would be if she would just choose me. She said she would choose me on the phone, but the next day I got an email from her basically saying otherwise and terminating all relationships and communication with her because it was unhealthy (a point I find hard to argue against).  I was very angry, hated her, and then cooled off. Shortly after that I began to pursue my current gf.


So here is the crux of the problem. My ex is the first person, and for now the only person, that I've ever loved in a romantic relationship. There was an ease to how we were together and I was always happy, which was partially why I was so scared. Everything we did worked perfectly with each other when we were both fully open and the feelings were high and very intense. When I was with her, the longings I had for her physically ached. And I fear these feelings and thoughts are leading me to self-sabotage my new relationship.


My new gf is the first serious gf since my ex and I want to try and see if this is going to go somewhere. At the very least I want to be able to be open and committed in this relationship. But every so often my mind brings up my ex, where things felt and fit so perfectly, and makes stupid impossible comparisons. The feelings I have with my gf have not been as strong, as intense, or as high as they were with my ex. But I know it's unfair to compare two different people and two different time periods.


To some extent, my ex represents the great what if. The path that I did not travel but so often wish I did. Because of how we broke up, usually with distance being a factor, I never really got a lot of closure. I feel like I never got to really ride out that relationship to see if it worked or not. And that kind of incompleteness compared with it being my first time in love and the incredible intensity of it all leads me to constantly have doubts about who I'm with now. The thought that I found the person I was meant to be with or that I worked supremely well with and that I let it slip through my grasp because I didn't try hard enough.


So how do I get rid of this ghost of my ex so that I can focus on who I'm with now? Will that intensity and ease return or is it possible in a new relationship? Or is all of that just sort of what emerges from the first person you love and I'm simply chasing the dragon, so to speak. I know there are tons of these asking how do I know if s/he's the one? and this is somewhat related, but ultimately I want those intense feelings again and I'm curious if I can regain them.



Thanks for any input received, and the flair will probably be confusing because this could be relationships, personal issues, or breakups.

In the past weeks, my ex and I were fighting a lot. In addition, we hardly had time to talk because I have class at 8am, and then I go to work and come home at 10pm. He works from 3-11pm. This means that by the time he gets home, I'm already tired and sleepy. We hardly talked, and he always seemed to be angry or in a bad mood. He would tell me that he would randomly get upset at work for no reason. I was getting sick of being tired, and then feeling I have to walk on eggshells whenever we talk. The smallest thing could make him mad. He also started complaining that I was never happy when I see him, and I never sound happy on the phone. I always tell him it's not true. It's just that I'm always tired. I never get more than 6 hours of sleep anymore. Finally, we have another small fight, and it suddenly blows up into something bigger. He decides he wants to break up and go back to his old life. At this point I was crying and telling him to stop and work things out with me. He refuses and for the whole day, he ignores me as he decides to sleep. When I see him online later that night, I decided to call his phone and drive to his house, hoping that he would be in a better mood. He refuses to come out and meet me and says that he has already gone back to his old life, and we're over. He said a lot of things just to hurt me, and then he deletes me everywhere. I take this as a sign to give up, and I decide to get over him by blocking his phone number and email. 

---

The next day he sends me a message through google saying that he's dropping off his stuff at my front door. I say Thank you and nothing else. He proceeds to text one of my friends to tell me to pick up my stuff because it's very expensive, and he doesn't want someone else to take it. Apparently, he waited for a couple hours before leaving, and I sent my brother to get my stuff.

---

The day after that, he shows up at my workplace after I get off work. He talked to his boss, someone who he considers as his own father, about what had happened. His boss told him he could finish all his work and leave early if he wants to talk to me, but he suggests giving me space. He comes by and says that he wants to apologize. I accept his apology, but I don't want to get back together. He then tells me that he lied about everything he said it's because he was just mad. He was angry and upset about the state of our relationship and all the fighting and that I didn't seem to care. He said he went crazy because he was so angry about our fighting and my lack of caring, but he regretted it. He tried to contact me a few hours after the breakup conversation but I had already blocked him. He also said that he wants to improve everything about our relationship and lack of communication. He promised to be better and all that. This all sounds like typical things people say to get what they want, and I don't know if it's gonna be better if we do get back together. We're always gonna be that couple that fights and then gets back together, and I hate it. 

---

I don't really know what to do at this point. He isn't at the best spot in his life. Do I go back to No Contact? I'm pretty secure in my decision that I want to be alone for now. I actually kinda liked going to bed whenever I felt like it and being rested for work, instead of staying up and waiting for him and then talking on the phone for a couple hours. I do still care for him, and I will always miss how nice it made me feel whenever he held me. But, that could just be my graduation goggles. My bestfriend pretty much thinks he's a scumbag for what he did. She thinks I should ignore him, and get a restraining order if he shows up to my house/work again. I don't know what to do. Please help me.

14819,Relationships,2qsvvv,"To be clear- I have nothing wrong with people that like other dudes/gals. My best friend growing up is gay. He's coming to the wedding with his parents. We're hosting the reception in my home state at his parents home. My uncle is gay. So, I guess you could say that I'm very friendly with the LGBT community. I have no problem with the lifestyle- it's just not for me. However, I drink. A lot. Sometimes I go on adventures. Meaning, I'll go out for a drink at a bar at 4:00PM and won't come home until 3:00AM when the cab drops me off. 

This story begins at the start at one of those adventures. I went out to a wine bar that's part of my apartment community. I met a dude at the bar who was chill (mind you, I was already drunk at this point), and we got to chatting. He's a staff member of the apartment complex there for a going away party for one of his co-workers. I've lived here for 3 years, so I've known the staff and the woman they're saying goodbye to, and met this dude by proxy. He's a cool guy. We drank some more at the bar and I got the bright idea that since I have a new drinking buddy, we should Uber it to a whiskey bar up the street since I love drinking there too. They have a great selection!

We first go grab me a pack of smokes, then go up to his place so he can grab his jacket. Everything seems normal at this point. I stood on his balcony in the single apartment and smoked a cig, everything was chill.

We Uber it to this whiskey bar and I order two of my favorite shots of whiskey (middleton and glenfiddich 18). This guy, we'll call him G, doesn't like whiskey, but I told him I'd buy, so I drink both of them. I snag G a beer since no one likes drinking alone, and he drinks it.

Then, (this is where things start getting hazy), apparently we Uber it to a very well known gay club in my city. Again, I've been to gay clubs before (with other gay friends only) and I'm okay with being around folks of the opposite sexual persuasion. I'm even joking with the dude that I hope he picks up someone and leaves me there so I can cab it home by myself. 

The next thing I remember is that he's shoving his tongue into my face. I'm blackout at this point. I'm not okay with this. I'm also pretty sure I wasn't coherent enough to push him away quick enough for him to really think that it was **not** okay. Although, he tried to kiss me again and I pushed him away. He tried repeatedly to kiss me again and I said no. Did I kiss him back initially in my blackout state? I don't remember. The next thing I know, he's super offended and leaves me at this gay bar (outside the place where I can smoke), by myself. I remember him saying that we kissed, isn't that okay? as an attempt to get me to kiss him again. I kept pushing him away and saying no, that it wasn't.

The only thing I remember from standing outside after he left is that I was swaying and could barely stand and every guy that walked into the club/their partner asked me if I was okay. I wasn't.

I eventually stumbled up the street and caught a cab home. 

I couldn't sleep the entire night because I felt like I cheated on my fiancee. 

I feel like I gave this guy the wrong signals all night by being someone he could talk to and being nice to him, but that he took it as me flirting with him and that the kiss would be okay. It wasn't. 

I don't want to tell her this happened because:
a.) It'd be admitting I have a drinking problem
b.) I was so drunk I got into an Uber with a dude I just met and he took me to a gay club
c.) I also feel really taken advantage of and super uncomfortable

30737,Relationships,1vmmxr,"Hi everyone,

So as the title says, I am not sure whether I want to continue dating my current girlfriend Ellie. I am going to start off with some background on us and our relationship and then go on to explain why I am feeling this way. Then hopefully you all can help me out and give me some advice or tell me how your past experiences dealing with this type of issue played out in your lives.

Ellie and I began dating when we were in high school and when it came time to move to go to university we moved in together. We are both currently in school and have very busy schedules (her more than I as she works almost full time while going to school) and as a result have very limited time to go out together to events and other date night activities. Our relationship, like many of this length I would imagine, has had it's ups and downs, but we have always been able to work as a team and get through the low points.

Okay, so a couple months ago I began to feel unhappy in my relationship. I guess the best way to put it is I began to feel indifferent to the whole thing. I began to think of not having Ellie in my life anymore and what would happen if we broke up, and every time I do I don't think I would be that upset about it, like it didn't matter if she was around or not. I tried to in point what was making me feel this way. Sure Ellie works way more than she needs to and doesn't try to take time off for events even with prior notice, but that's nothing a conversation couldn't address right?

So I talk to Ellie and explain that I am unhappy with the lack of time we have together and that I would appreciate it if she was able to make more time for us instead of always about work (which I feel bad about because she is really passionate about her work) and she agrees that something needs to change and she does. We have much more time now then we ever had since she started her job. Thing is I still don't feel any better. I'm still unhappy, and I've started shying away from being close and intimate with her. 

So this continues on until Christmas break and I blame a lot of it on being stressed out for finals. So we go home for the holidays and things haven't got better, haven't got worse and I'm thinking this is just something I will get over soon enough. During the break I see some of my old friends that I have not seen since high school, Sawyer and Kayla. Now I have kept in touch with Sawyer but have not talked to Kayla in almost 2 years. We all go out for supper and drinks and they talk about how they have been traveling and doing all these super cool things and learning new instruments and all that fun stuff, and I start thinking that is so cool! Why am I not doing these types of things? I used to love all of this stuff but I haven't done any of it since being with Ellie.

The night continues and I am catching up with Kayla and we are flirting quite a bit, and the entire time I am having a blast. The night comes to an end and I can't stop thinking about the great time I had with Kayla, and why me and Ellie never flirt like that. I think I just don't want to flirt with Ellie, I know she tries to do the same things Kayla was doing, and yet I shy away from her but welcome Kayla's. I don't even think it is just Kayla so much as Kayla making me realize I want all these things but just not from Ellie maybe?

I continued to meet up with Kayla and catch up and on New Years Eve Ellie chose to work instead of come out with us and did not want to meet up after she was done. So Kayla, Sawyer and I go out and again me and Kayla flirt the whole time to the point where she is holding my hand. I know Ellie would not be comfortable with me doing that and it would cross a boundary, but I did not care at the time as it just made me feel so happy (I know that is very selfish and I did tell Ellie when I saw her the next day).

Now we are back to today, Kayla has gone home, and I think about her often. I know this is just a stupid crush and that it will fade but am I not just going to want this same thing with someone else? Why don't I want this with Ellie? Aside from her overworking, our relationship has been pretty good. Is it because I am bored? Content? Too comfortable? Or am I just changing and growing out of this relationship? My fear is that I end things and wake up one day and go Way to go, she was perfect and you left her. Many of my friends have told me that I just want to experience different things while other have told me I just want to be with other girls and have hook ups, but that is not what I am after. I never hooked up with Kayla, I just loved the flirting and subtle touches on the shoulder and holding hands, and just being with someone who shares the same interests and makes you want to do more with yourself. Then again that used to be Ellie too though.

I guess I just don't even know where my own head is at right now, and I just need to know if I can stick through this and things will get better and I will want to flirt with my girlfriend again, want to seek out adventure and travel with my girlfriend again. Or is everything likely to just get worse and it would be better to tear the bandage off now quickly than to slowly let it pull away at my skin over time and fall off.

That's all good and well and I plan on doing so, but I need to know if I'm crazy here or if she's just selfish. This girl was an ex-girlfriend of a buddy of mine and we started liking each other shortly after they had broken up. He went away to Europe of 2 months and while he was gone we got really close but never did anything because we didn't want to go behind anyones back. After a couple months of just talking we finally hung out one night and decided that we wanted to be together. We told him and he said he never wanted to talk to either of us ever again and has not since. In turn I ended up losing a lot of friends and a lot of respect for myself, but I didn't care because I had found what I described to my dad as a game-changer (I swore to God I was going to marry this girl). The first few months were bliss, our honeymoon phase I guess, but we lived an hour apart and she's a nurse and in nurse practitioner school so we didn't see each other as much as we should've and it resulted in arguments. I didn't care about the space or time but she did I guess. She told me a couple days ago that it was a mistake for her to get into a relationship right after she broke it off with her old boyfriend and just wants to be single for a while. I pretty much broke down but in the end was respectful of her decision. The reality is is I'm not sure how something that was so real and so perfect could've ended this way and the thought of never getting to be with her ever again makes my self-worth sink to something I have never felt before. She didn't really seem to care that I had given up almost ALL of my friends to be with her and I didn't hang it over her head because I know it was ultimately my decision, but still, it just feels wrong to me. I'm not sure if any of this is going to make much sense, I'm just lost right now and trying to hold it together but I keep bouncing from fuck her, you're better off to how the fuck could you be so stupid. I don't know, this is the first time this has ever happened to me so I'm just looking for any guidance or anything to maybe make me feel a little better. Not trying to feel sorry for myself but it's really hard not to, because honestly I don't think anyone (my friends, that I have left, or hers) really cares.

A few months into our friendship, I began to like my friend. I didn't want to admit it, but another friend of mine, who has known him for long, noticed. I admitted it, but I still felt unsure.

I thought he might actually feel something for me when he gave me an iPod he had saved up for for Christmas this past year (2012). He confused me even more when this past February he took a girl at our school on a few dates, and even when he took another friend to Prom in April. During the school year it was hard for me to try to figure out what he felt for me because I didn't see him often. People started to ask me if we were dating and all I could say was no. However, once summer started we began to see each other more. Usually it is for the school club we founded together, but we mostly end up talking about our futures and what we want to do, as well as basic teenager stuff.


I have realized that my feelings for my friend grow stronger and stronger and I can't get rid of them. I ache to tell him how I feel, but I am scared that he will reject me. I know the worst he can do is say he doesn't feel the same way. However, I am extremely shy when it comes to relationships, which is why I have never had a boyfriend. I really want to tell my friend how I feel about him because we are starting our senior year of high school in August and I don't want to live with the regret of not telling him. Also, I have NEVER felt this way about anyone before.

16814,Relationships,1m89i6,"First of all, I'm not sure what to call my SO right now. We are currently putting things on hold indefinitely.

The backstory:
I met SO three months ago at a bar. He claims it was love at first sight. I thought he was a douche bag when I first saw him. He asked me out, and I figured one date couldn't hurt. We ended up hitting it off. The story of how we met is really adorable and I wish I could share, but I know he's on reddit. Even though he is probably not on this subreddit, I'll omit it just incase he stumbles across it. 

Things went really fast emotionally. We just connected on a whole other level I have never gotten from anyone else. He says it's the same for him. He claims he has told me more about himself than he has to anyone else. 

We both have issues that we recognize and have to deal with. He wanted/wants to be in marines. It is something he has felt he has to do. He put it on hold a few times because of past girlfriends, and his mother not being okay with him going. And then there is the abandonment issues and family issues, but I won't go into detail on those. I have no problem proving to him that I want to stay. I care about him more than anything. I have never once told him not to go into the marines. If it makes him happy and a better person I fully support it and will stand by his side. 

The problem:
I go to a college that is in a different city than he lives in. We got to spend a lot of time together during the summer, but now we can't see each other as much. 

On top of this, he works three jobs and is a full time student. The pressure and workload is a lot for anyone to handle. I know I couldn't handle it. I think he feels like he has to prove himself as a man. He also is obligated to keep this up in order to make it week-to-week. His parents could help, but they refuse. He is going to crash and burn from the work load. 

Lately he has been sensitive to me bringing up any possibility of a relationship. He feels hurt that he can't be the man I need right now. He told me not to get my hopes up on anything. He refused to see me one time, because he felt like he failed me. Which in turn hurt me, because I was in town for a limited time. It also felt selfish.

Every time I bring up the possibility of us dating he gets frustrated, because he can't be there for me. 

I really want him to be happy. He deserves to be happy more than any person I have met, after all he's gone through. I truly admire him. But I don't want to watch him crash and burn with his workload. I know he needs time to figure out who he is as a man and what it takes to be happy, especially before we can be in a happy functional relationship. And I don't want to hurt him anymore. I think we have stumbled on something great and I'm not willing to give up hope.

24307,Relationships,2hwyqp,"Pardon my rambling - there's a lot here I'm leaving out for the sake of brevity, but feel free to ask me anything.  My girlfriend (I'll call her Vera) and I have been together about two years this month. A few years ago (before we met) she decided to change careers and go into medicine and has been studying for the MCAT for most of our relationship. In the past month she has ramped up the intensity of her studying regimen and spends 6-7 days a week in the library.

Over the past few months she's felt she's been having to drag me to make progress in the relationship and has noticed some patterns in my behavior that have caused her some pain - primarily prioritizing things over her, me not reciprocating communication as often, and there being an imbalance of flexibility (she would come up to my place more often than I would go down to hers, etc.) these actions were unconscious but ultimately led to her feeling like she wasn't getting the level of support she needed while she goes through this critical and difficult time leading up to her exam - it also signaled to her that I wasn't serious about the future with her and highlighted we may have different goals. After meeting with her therapist together we decided to take some time to de-intensify the relationship so that I could address some of my behavior with a therapist of my own and work on myself, and so that she could focus on her studies without the confusion of her feelings towards me weighing on her and distracting her.  

After a few weeks of this it felt like we were making good progress - we were seeing eachother once a week, a pace we were comfortable with… but had set up boundaries (no sex or spending the night) During this time we discussed the future and confirmed we do want the same things in life, and we do want to move in together in the next few months, and get married and have children in the next few years. These conversations and our time together left me feeling very optimistic about the immediate future. 

However, this past Saturday she blindsided me…  I went to go visit her at the library (it didn't help that she was very stressed out and felt behind on her studies.)  Vera said that things still felt weird... that it's too difficult to maintain this de-intensified relationship and feel emotionally confused, and that she didn't want to be intimate with me - not due to lack of attraction, but because she is so scared of slipping back into my old patterns. I told her that while I understood and acknowledge lasting change takes lots of time and effort, I promised her I wouldn't let that happen and that the steps I've taken such as going to therapy and addressing the origins of the behavior, as well as being hyper-communicative, etc... it all sounded like I was trying to convince her to keep seeing me, but I truly believe in my ability to be loving and supportive in the ways she needs. She asked, Why can't you just give me what I want and let me focus on the exam? ...so I agreed to. She asked we go no contact and pick things up again after her test date, which is November 7th.

This is so difficult, I am counting down the days til November 7th (about 5 weeks from now), and planning to contact her on the 8th.  It's scary to go through this time without access to her and no way to know what it will be like when we see each other in a month - she may harden her heart to me out of habit in self-preservation but the romantic in me holds hope she'll be open to spend some time together and make a decision about me based on that.  I know lasting changes take a lot of time so I'm using this as an opportunity to continue to work on myself and be the best version of myself but it's very scary knowing there's a potential to lose this very important relationship.  I don't have expectations for her decision though I know she loves me very much. Vera's fears are valid and I am trying to be respectful of her wish of no contact even though I am saddened. Hopefully she’ll be open to allow me to show her how I’ve matured.

As far as why I’m posting here, I guess I’m wondering if anyone’s been in a similar situation - how did it work out? in what ways was the relationship new and different when you re-established contact after a separation? any advice? Hopefully a bit of time will make this easier and give us more clarity.

19467,Relationships,2umi7f,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year. When we first met he was making minimum wage at a coffee shop. He quit that job, and recently found a new one as a developer for a well backed startup. I tried to be as supportive as I could when he was in the process of being interviewed. I helped him shop for clothes and went with him to get a haircut because I know he loathes doing those things. I understood that transitioning jobs is one of the most stressful events a person can go through. 


However, here comes the first issue: our dwindling sex life. We used to do the dirty almost every day, and sometimes multiple times a day if we spent the whole day together. Now, he wakes up at 7 and stays at work until 8. It's understandable that he's too tired to hang out or make love on the weekdays, but we barely have sex on the weekends anymore. I usually try to initiate a few times when we are together, but I get rejected. This is taking a toll on my self esteem. I talked to him about it, and told him that I felt unwanted and unloved. He told me that he was just too tired and the last thing on his mind is sex.

I suppose I can deal with not having as much sex as I want because I can satisfy myself, but I can't deal with the gap in intimacy. We rarely get to talk, and even more rarely get to spend quality time together. I honestly feel a bit jealous of his coworkers because they get to spend almost 10 hours a day with him, whereas I only get a few hours a week.

I haven't been sitting at home pining for him. I have been keeping myself busy by immersing myself in my schoolwork and delving into hobbies such as mycology, growing carnivorous plants, sculpture, cooking, creating jewelry, yoga, cooking (there's more but I won't bore you by listing it all). I just want a companion that I can share my life with. 


Another issue that has arisen is money. This past weekend we went to a bar that is a out of my budget. I am a full time student and am not currently working. I told him that I couldn't split the bill, and he seemed fine with it. However, the next day he said Funny thing, the girls at work were talking about the bar we went to last night. Apparently they go there all the time. Maybe you should study business and apply for a job at my company so you can go to that bar too. 


I felt really inadequate and upset when he made that comment. I am happy with the major that I chose, and will be graduating with a degree in physics in May. When I told him that I felt upset he got annoyed and claimed that he was just joking. He said that I really seemed to enjoy the food and beer at the bar, so wouldn't it be great if I could go there all the time. I told him that I felt like he was comparing me to the girls that he works with, and that made me feel bad. He then said that he was super tired and stopped talking to me. 


**Questions:** How do I communicate my needs to my boyfriend, and how do I get them fulfilled? How do I deal with the lack of intimacy and quality time? Was I being too sensitive about the bar comment that my boyfriend made?

563,Breakups,2bc2d2,"This started Thursday night,  I came home after work and she proceeded break up saying she was not happy and that she thinks I'm not happy as well and we would both be better in a different relationship.  I think things have been very challenging in our relationship, we have struggled with spending habits, housing and steady work.


We finally moved into a new house about 4 months ago on a 2 year lease, We both found stable equal paying careers.  We have 2 puppies that are just about a year each that we both love to death.  We are more entwined then some married couples I know, Car loans, Student loans, Lease agreements, Joint bank accounts,  Everything has both our names on it.  We were looking at rings 6 months ago.  We have had some ups and down but overall we have had a great relationship and we both know that we care about each other.


Since I was so distraught about the break up I called off work Friday to talk to her about it.


I suggested that we live as friends and try to grow personally and see if we can reignite our old flame.  She agreed to try.  I have moved into the spare bedroom and into the 2nd bathroom.  I am not allowed to tell her I love her anymore.  We are allowed to hug, as friends.  Not sure if that is helping or hurting but it is a temporarily physical relief from all the tension.  We have been getting along, She knows this is the hardest thing I have ever done.  


Today she starts working nights, So I will barely see her during the week maybe 1-2 nights that she is off if she stays home.  


She recently has gone through a sort of depression and has found great personal success joining a market affiliate company and running her own social business.  I can't help but think that because of this venture she is viewing me as the big negative aspect in her life and she has to make a change. They promote empowering independent woman.  I have always been there to save her either financially or physically with obligations and responsibilities. 


I really want to better myself: Hit the Gym, Ride my Motorcycle more, Start reading more.  It will be hard but I still want to believe that this is what our relationship needs to grow into what it can be.  It's hard because she can be very hard to read right now.  I don't know if she has no faith and is just using this position as an excuse to keep the house and animals together with me off to the side to clean and cook for her.  


We have worked outside together last night installing a new fence for our dogs and it was enjoyable.  She ordered pizza and we sat together for some time.  I only get relief when she is around and I don't know if that is holding me back from letting her go but in my heart I don't want to let her go.  But I know I have to accept that as it is the reality right now.

21735,Relationships,1j0lgl,"I've been dating my boyfriend for a year now and it's all been really amazing. Lately, though, after graduating from university, I've been having some esteem issues that I'm trying to work out - I don't feel pretty enough, smart enough, and I'm generally not very confident about my future in the real world. This has caused me to have a general emotion of being depresses (I can't say if I'm actually depressed because I haven't been diagnosed, but I've been experiencing some of the typical sentiments, although I've mostly been able to keep them under control). 

My boyfriend knows about all of this and is being really supportive. However, it seems like he's sometimes beating himself up over it because he can't do more, and I understand him because I'd probably be feeling the same in his situation. Generally, though, I like to think that I'm managing to keep things in check well enough so they don't become an ever present cloud over our relationship. It's just a talk about it here and there. 

A while ago, however, after one of our talks, he confided to a female friend about these issues, saying stuff like he wishes there was a way to help me. This is a friend whom I also know and like, but am not very close to. I didn't find this out from him, though. I knew they were hanging out and after that, I get a Facebook message from her about how she feels for me, how it must be tough, but if successful, beautiful women like me don't think they're good enough, what hope is there for the rest, how I should snap out of it and realize I'm great, etc. 

Now, I get that she could have been trying to help, but I feel this was completely out of line; not only do I now feel guilty for feeling the way I do, but I feel very disappointed and betrayed by my boyfriend. I get that being around someone who feels like I do can probably be tough, but I confided in him something I haven't ever shared with anyone else. I only let him in on this and I didn't want everyone and their circle of friends to know. Furthermore, I know it's not his fault, but the fact that I found out about him sharing this via this Facebook message whose tone was seemingly helpful but not all that compassionate, from someone I don't deem close enough to share this with, really devastated me. I'm sure she thinks she helped a lot and put things in perspective for me, though. I haven't had any discussion about it with her since and I don't plan to. 

I've talked to him about it and he's apologized many times over, saying he vented and he realizes that it got out of control. I accepted his apology because he really meant it and I know there is little else he could do in this situation to make up for it, but I still feel like my trust has been broken and like I've been betrayed. I'm also incredibly embarrassed and don't know how I'll look this girl in the eye now that she knows so much about me that I didn't want to share. 

How do I get over this? What can I do to stop feeling this badly about this?

2020,Relationships,2vd3xp,"So, my boyfriend and I have a recurring argument that we're never able to solve, and it leads to a lot of unpleasantness between us.  I was hoping y'all could help us out.

We've been dating for about 3 years, since we started college (we go to the same school).  Today's version of the ongoing argument came up when I casually asked him what he wanted to do for Valentine's Day.  I usually plan our dates, so I asked him to plan V-day.  He said oh, I thought we could go to Potbelly (sandwich place) and then take a long walk.  I could feel my face falling, but I tried my best to hide my reaction; I didn't want to be the high-maintenance girlfriend.  I told him we could just cancel the holiday and have a normal Saturday night (studying and watching TV).  He knew I was looking forward to the holiday and asked why I was backtracking.  I tried deflecting the question, but eventually the Dream came out.

My Dream Valentine's day is to go to the grocery store with him, buy ingredients, cook a nice dinner together, and watch old movies in our pajamas.  Sounds simple, right?  Well, we don't go off campus or cook ever, so this is something new and exciting for us, and something I've always wanted to do.  I told BF about it, but I said something along the lines of No, it's just the Dream, I don't want to spoil it by trying it out.

This pissed my boyfriend off.  You see, he's the kind of guy that, when he has a dream, tries really really hard to achieve it.  He'll stay up all night, work himself to the bone, that sort of thing.  Me, I have these little fanciful dreams--writing a novel, having a nice wedding, designing clothes, celebrating V-day, etc--little dreams that get me through the dullness of everyday life.  Boyfriend always tells me to go out and pursue them, but to me that defeats the purpose of having these dreams.  They're meant to be perfect and untouched, just to keep myself happy and hopeful.  I never intend to do any of them.  This doesn't make me a lump that doesn't do anything.  I have goals, boring practical ones, but these dreams are fun and exciting and close to my heart.  I don't want them ruined by reality.

My boyfriend doesn't understand this mindset.  He thinks mishaps along the way are part of what makes the experience memorable.  To me, they're just worrying and they spoil the experience.  I prefer never trying things to trying and failing.  The dreams keep me happy, you know?  And why shouldn't I be happy?

Who's in the wrong here?  I personally don't understand his mindset, and he doesn't understand mine.  If I'm wrong, what should I do?  If he's wrong, how can I communicate this to him?

(In the construction business.) 10 months ago he moved away to another state, he was going through a lot and he and his wife were close to getting divorced, I think moving was them trying to work on their marriage, at least that is what I heard.

He is still married and his family returns in June.) I now have a new position and we will see each other/work together often.



The other day we were talking about his return and how he's doing. He was sort of whispering, so I said are you nervous? Why are you whispering? He said yes, he's nervous and he motioned/started walking further in the warehouse until he reached a spot and he continued talking. He told me he's lonely and is going through a tough time. I felt kind of bad for him, so the following day I texted him and asked if he would like to go out to lunch tomorrow. He texted back saying he would love to.


The next day arrives and I'm in the warehouse picking up my order and I walk past him (I didn't stop and talk, no big deal right? I'm busy.) He starts saying you just gunna walk by? not say anything? you just gunna walk past me? he then walked over to me and tried talking about my order, but I saw what I needed to see and I walked away.



He called me later that afternoon and asked if I still wanted to go to lunch. And for some reason I said no I can't. He asked what's wrong and I just said I don't understand you. He told me he tried to talk me in the warehouse and I kept walking and he figured he would follow me over to my order, but then I walked away there too. He said he wants to get together and talk, and asked what I was doing Saturday I told him I have plans and he said okay, he will call me soon and we will get together some other time.

He agreed, but he keeps popping up.

First it was on Skype, just trying to chat and offer me help (I have an SSDI case pending and I'm anxious over it) and then bailing (or as I call it 'ostriching' - sticking his head in the sand and waiting it out) when I'd tell him this was hurting me, and causing me false hope.

Suddenly he has a  FB (after telling me during our 18 month relationship he'd NEVER have one, I'm on mine a lot of contact with old friends) and he's friends with a mutual friend. I asked friend how they met, and he said 'a party'. I shook my head as it was odd, but tried to push on, despite FB telling me 'you should be friends!' with it's stupid crap.

Next, OKC. I have had a profile for several months, as a way to push myself out there and to get over him. He looked at my profile several times, and it logs it. This is well known, so of course he'd known I saw him.

After a few 'visits' to my profile, I sent a message of 'why are you looking at my profile? and was met with 'you're still lovely to look at, and I wanted to say hi but wasn't sure'

Prior to this, I had told him to never contact me unless he wanted reconciliation of our relationship. That I couldn't and wouldn't ever be able to be 'pals' and that would never change. That he had to keep the NC or deal with his feelings, this was dragging on too long.

Of course, he's 'ostriched' again, and I'm so damned tired of it.  I do still love him, and if feels like everytime I get a hold on my feelings, he 'pops up' in some way, and I'm really tired of it.

Why would he keep doing this, knowing how I feel? Does he just not give a crap? Does he have feelings and won't deal with them?

I've been blunt the last times we've 'talked' and I've told him to stop doing this...but he doesn't. It's hurting me and prolonging my ability to get over his 'hope' that he still cares.

I get that the story is nothing all that special, and I know we all go through hideous breakups. I also know that I'm better off without someone who could behave with so little empathy or respect. 

I know that. Rationally.


I think what I'm trying to ask is how can I help my heart catch up with my mind? Rationally, I get it. But I feel like my world is ending. I'm having better and longer up times every day now, I know there's light at the end, somewhere. But these dark moments are horrendous.

How do I stop feeling as though her treating me like trash means I am trash? That my being less interesting than her ex is a direct reflection of my worth? That I'm going to be miserable and alone forever? This all sounds even more pathetic written here than in my head. I apologise for the utter lack of eloquence.

887,Relationships,3bd00b,"Hello. Me and my boyfriend, 22 and 24, have been together for a year and a half. When I first met him, I knew that he enjoyed games like League, Dota, Counter Strike, etc. He would play them quite often but it never really bugged me at the time because it never conflicted with anything and he always made time for me. Also when I met him, he was working over night at a gas station, taking bong rips twice every hour that Snoop himself would approve, and smoking cigarettes out the wazoo. He was also incredibly depressed and used this as a means to cope. He is insanely smart, so I didn't understand why he was working the graveyard shift at a gas station, but I didn't care because I really liked him.

Long story short, I helped him quit his job, and basically wrote up a great resume for him and applied for jobs for him day and night. At the same time, he quit smoking weed and cigarettes. I did everything I could for him. A thing that irked me during that time though was that instead of helping me apply for his jobs, he played games. And when I would ask him at the end of the day if he had applied to anything, he would get defensive and tell me that he had looked at a few Craigslist ads and whatnot. I kind of dismissed it because I just figured it was him still trying to acclimate to all the changes and that was his way of managing the stress, and I liked him enough to keep helping him through it. 

Fast forward a few months - he has a great normal job and everything is going great. Then he decides it's a good idea to bring back the weed. I have absolutely no qualms with weed at all, but due to the unhealthy history he's had with it, I was a bit nervous. He started a pretty mild routine and stuck with it, which I was happy about. But as soon as he started picking up again, I noticed some behaviors start to kick back up. He hasn't stopped playing League of Legends throughout all of this, but now he starts to start taking it really seriously. He plays hours on end, yelling at the screen, and it's ALL he talks about now a days. Every aspect of that game bleeds into his conversations with me, every other word is about it, and he makes references to it like it's his religion. It seems like unless it's about League, we have nothing to talk about anymore. It got to one point that he started crying after a game and he constantly stormed out of the apartment after games. He smoked the weed in the bathroom and the smell started to seep out into the bedroom which stuck to everything and gave me a headache, so I asked him to take some steps to maybe lessen the smell when he comes out like wash his hands or something, and he acted like it was such an inconvenience to him. 

Well fast forward to a month and a half ago. His job got suddenly cut short. Because he needed to get a new job, he quit smoking the weed in order to pass the upcoming drug tests. Well it's been hell. Because he can't smoke weed, he now smokes cigarettes to supplement the cravings. If it's not one thing, it's something else. He keeps telling me that it'll only be for 1 more week, but he's making no effort to stop. The smell is awful, it gets on everything, and I don't even want to go near him anymore. I've supported him so much through all of this and once again, I've made up his resume and have done so much for him, but he refuses to take initiative and do anything for himself. If I ask him to wash his hands after he smokes or if I spray air freshener, he gets this disgusted look on his face and acts like I'm insulting him. I've gotten to the point where I've broken down and cried and told him how much I hated the smoke and constant headaches I get, and he says oh I'll try to change, but yet, nothing has. He talks about League of Legends and Dota constantly now. Everything revolves around it.

I just don't know what to do anymore. On one side of him, he's this loving, caring boyfriend who is sweet and devoted, but this other side of him is addictive and terse. I feel guilty because the words pathetic and disgusting and repulsive have started to penetrate my thoughts when I think about him. I don't want to hug him or kiss him anymore because he refuses to brush his teeth after he smokes and he reeks of smoke, I feel like I can't have a conversation with him anymore because I feel like it'll either be about League of Legends or him getting terse with me because he doesn't want to deal with things going on in reality, and most of all, I'm feeling like I'm getting apathetic about our relationship because I feel like if anything needs to get done, I have to be the one to do it and it just feels like I'm carrying him on my back. I love him but I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm nearing the end of my rope and I don't want to get to that point...

8423,Infidelity,1q6tpy,"As a single person, I obviously hang out with many friends that are coupled. Over the past few months I have been spending a lot of time with one couple - Admittedly in part because I was attracted to my friend Rob. Also because we all have fun together.

Rob and Katie's relationship seems relatively dysfunctional. Lots of nagging, and berating that reminds me why I am happy to be out of MY old relationship of 5 years. Additionally, Katie has some serious issues with substance abuse. Whereas Rob and I certainly like to drink, party, and have fun.. Katie takes it to concerning extremes.

Over the past few months Rob and I have become closer solely out of the time we've spent together, but also because we started texting a lot. I didn't want to admit it was flirtatious at first.. Even though I knew it was. We ended up exchanging naked pictures, and having pretty frank, sexual conversations. This was obviously crossing lines, and I knew it - But I like Rob. And admittedly I haven't felt such sexual tension with anyone in my life. We ended up secretly hooking up one night while Katie was gone.. Since then our texting has definitely dwindled, and hanging out obviously feels really weird. Katie confides in me that she gets so frustrated with Rob, and tells me some of the extremely asshole things he does to her, but in all he's really good lately.. It's uncomfortable for me to watch when she drunkenly snuggles up to him, and kisses him. And it's hard for me to hear what a good guy he's been lately making her dinner, or having movie marathons - And I actually find myself weirdly jealous because again, I like Rob, and I guess I miss the perks of a relationship

30645,Relationships,33y7hc,"So my boyfriend of 1 year is going to start graduate school this June, and once his program ends (1year) he will most likely move out of state for work (this is what he wants). I fully support his career and educational goals and believe this is the best path for him to take.

We haven't seriously discussed about how our relationship fits into these plans. 

What we have discussed very briefly (2min maybe) went along the lines of me telling him that I think it will be best to stop seeing each other once June (his graduate program) begins. He assumed on the other hand we would continue dating each other, up until when, I'm not exactly sure. We dropped this conversation since it was right before a big trip together and decided to talk about it later.

Where I am in my life is that  I still need to finish two years of undergraduate, so I can not move away or do anything like that. I also don't know where my educational and career goals may lead me.

I really enjoy spending time with my boyfriend and it's the most serious relationship I ever had. However, I was quite surprised he still wanted to continue dating since he knows he will probably move away. He also expressed to me that he had a long distance relationship in the past which did not end well, and he doesn't think long distance works. 

So reddit, I'm really conflicted about where our relationship is and what to do about it. I do have some commitment issues and am pretty sure it plays a role in my decision staying with him or not. I don't want to get hurt or become a person who will resent him, because it is likely he will move away and it is likely there will be very little time for us to spend together once he starts graduate school.

I was all set to move on I had been gradually not calling her anymore not texting anymore and removed her from all social media. She has been relentless with not letting me do no contact. which is why I opted for limited contact. I just let her do all the conversation initiation I never reached out on my own.

After about two months of this i caved in and said maybe i'm being childish about this. 

Because honestly we used to be so close as friends before we were something more. So we decided to meet at a bar at a local college town. She was so happy that I decided to meet her but that's when the tension started. We made plans on tuesday to meet on Friday which was yesterday. 

On Wednesday she called and asked if us meeting means we're friends and she's unsure where I am in her life. I said i dunno lets just take it one thing at a time and try to meet. she agreed. 

A friend of ours was promoting a band and i said maybe we should go to the gig and listen to them play. She had huge reservations she said I dunno if I want to go. Because I want to have good quality time with you alone just you and me. She asked if we could just goto the local town bar to our old spot I had reservations about that and i sorta convinced her to go to the college town. 

We hit the first bar. Its good wasn't awkward. she lied about some things which i knew was her way to prevent an argument. Then i said lets go to the gig and we'll have a good time. 

We get there. I make some instant friends i'm the center of attention she meets some new people she's having fun. It felt like old times where we just mix with different people and enjoy the social nature of life. its a good vibe UNTIL i hear her talking about her boyfriend (the guy she left me for).

She comes back to the bar where i'm at with my people and she's all smiles and asks if i want to share a drink. I said sure, then i told her listen After this drink i'm just going to take you back home to your guy and call it a night.

She immediately got upset and asked me why i'm being a jerk. I said listen. You can do all these things meet different people and go out and have fun with your dude. You don't need me to do it.

And she's like do you have any idea how suffocating it is to be around someone all day every day? (she lives with him, he hates going out and is pretty much dependent on her for any social life). 

I said no because the people I date or are interested in have the same interest I do so We always have fun TOGETHER. I'm like don't you think that's a fucking problem with your relationship?

She agreed that it was and that's why she was out with me because me and her are one in the same with our interest and she's like i have so much fun with you.

Anyway it fell apart after that. Our much larger group combined and decided to go to another bar. she rode in another car and at the new bar we ignored each other completely. In fact I struck up a conversation with a really cute girl on purpose right in front of her and she flipped and vanished. To which i apologized to the cute girl and told her to enjoy her night. 

Outside the bar later in the night I told everybody i was going home. I looked to her and she said she was going to our friends party at his house. At this point she's drinking heavily and is pretty drunk.

I just say ok and with no hesitation turn around and walk to my car. Didn't look back and left her at the college town to find another ride home.

In my eyes we are to far gone. I'm to invested in my emotions towards her and I want more. and she wants to stay safe and be with a man she's not even happy with. its obvious. But for her its an easy choice. Be with a guy who's outgoing and has lots of attention or stay safe and be with a guy who doesn't even have any male friends let alone get attention.

How should i play this? i feel that I should go STRICT no contact and just allow myself to overcome these emotions I have for her. And then MAYBE approach friendship. But as of right now I can't deal with being friends just hearing his name is a trigger that burns me from the inside out until there's nothing but negativity in my heart.

So basically I've always been a fan of this famous cosplayer called Jessica Nigri (blonde, skinny, toned, big breast, ..), I always found her a very attractive lady and you can say I have a celebrity crush on her. I have no desire to meet her whatsoever though, just enjoy looking at her pictures and videos. Recently my girlfriend (who is short, brunette, chubby, smaller breast)  who I've been with for 4 months, noticed that I often visit Jessica Nigri's facebook page to look at images (like once a day to see what's new). I explained to her how Jessica Nigri is the woman I would have posters of on my wall (I dont actually have any) but that her picture is the one on my night stand, on my office desk and that she's the one I love and that I wanna spend my life with.

She has been dealing with insecurity issues for many years, she has general low self-esteem and told me that for every relationship she's always felt that she wasnt good enough. Now because she knows about my celebrity crush she is basically very unhappy because she wants to be my celebrity crush, she wants to be the girl who I put posters of on my wall, she does not want me to have eyes for anyone else (even celebrities) and she wants to be my everything.

Now she is currently worrying so much that she is dying her hair blonde, going on a diet to become skinny and she wants to start wearing the same makeup as my celebrity crush. I keep telling her every day that I love her exactly how she is and that no matter what she looks like I will always love her. She tells me I broke her by telling her I find Jessica Nigri hotter and that she will not be happy until she looks exactly like Jessica Nigri now, even if it makes her uncomfortable to change.

What do I do? Am I a dick for admitting my celebrity crush? Am I wrong for thinking it's ok to have a celebrity crush and that my gf should stop trying to be exactly like her? How can I make her feel happy about herself when she never has been able to? Does anyone have a similar situation and how did you fix it?

**EDIT**: In an attempt to try and stop her from trying to be someone else, I said that she'll never be able to take the celebrity crushes place and that really upset her more. I love her a lot, I think shes gorgeous, but I just dont want to lie to her about me thinking that some famous half naked model has more sex appeal than her. I guess this made the situation worse though :/

**EDIT 2**: Thank you for making me realise my mistake. I told my story with both my fuckups and my good intentions, so I accept that my fuckups outweight my good intentions and that I just did something really horrible to my girlfriend by making her feel that way. My girlfriend did admit that she does hate herself (even before) and have no self-esteem, we will try and get that fixed together. However, none of that makes what I said any better and it definitely made it worse, so I have some making up to do.

For those of you who wonder how someone can feel that way about someone they love; she always says I'm like Spock (and I agree), I'm very logical and whenever I do something I do it by reasoning and using logical thinking (to me atleast), feelings dont influence the things I do or say a lot. Thankfully my girlfriend is a sweetheart and she assured me that she knows I have good intentions with her and that she wouldn't want to trade me for anyone, so this Reddit thread definitely helped both of us.

**Thank you reddit! Even though the truth was hard to take, it did help the both of us**

So I understand that I don't have the experience of raising kids to really have authority on the subject, but I am still very concerned.

I would not describe my friend's marriage as a happy one. They are always fighting about every little thing that comes up, and his wife is particularly offensive in how she treats him, what with name calling and constant put-downs. The big problem is that they do all this right in front of the kids, and as someone who has been involved in the lives of their entire family since it began, I can see a very obvious mimicking by the kids of their parents. The oldest, who is a girl, will yell at her brothers in the exact same way that she sees her mom dealing with my friend. The middle one who is a boy is very shy and timid, which is what he sees in his dad. The youngest is 2 years old so he doesn't have a particular personality formed yet, but I am concerned for the future.

My friend and his wife yell at each other in front of the kids, name-call, and even air their disagreements on how to raise their kids right there in front of them as they are listening. A particular instance happened yesterday when my friend was telling two of his kids that they had had enough screen time for the day, at which point his wife started yelling from the other room, eventually coming into the room we were in and yelling at him about how she had told them already that they could play on screens for the evening, and he was not to get in the way of her raising her kids. 

Here's the deal. The last time I interjected about something of this nature, I got slammed down as not understanding relationships, and the result was my friend no longer telling me the issues that bother him about his relationship (this also happened in conjunction with them beginning therapy, so it is likely the therapist told him to stop). I don't want to get further cut off or overstep my bounds, but this really bothers me that their kids are going to grow up thinking this type of relationship is normal, and will then continue to perpetuate this toxic style.

The last words he ever said were, You don't have to ever contact me again. I hope you're happy, I'm out of your life. This is what he texted me, because he couldn't be bothered to call me on the phone.


The last conversation I had with my mom, (Deanna) I was bummed out about my boyfriend. Tried to confide in her, and she simply went on and on about how she's so in love with her new fiancee, Lisa. How they're so happy, so in love and she loves Lisa's 2 year-old daughter. Isn't Lisa's daughter perfect? Isn't she beautiful? She's my new sister, (I'm an only child) do I know that?


I hung up on her.


My dad and I have always had our issues. I was an *unplanned blessing* when my mom was 19, and my dad in his mid-20's. Deanna has told me stories of Dave hitting her with me in her arms. Or, how he threatened to take me away from her, and simply drop the subject when she'd call his bluff and hand me over.


Before, during, and even after the divorce, I was always a weapon to Dave. Sometimes it felt like Deanna did the same, keeping custody of me until I was 18, even though I moved in with Dave at 13. They would always put me in the middle, forcing me to choose between them. 


Dave got married when I was about 14/15. Instantly, New Wife was his everything. 


We had to go to church because New Wife was Lutheran, despite my dad being Atheist for much of his life. 


New Wife had pets, and even though Dave hated animals, he suddenly loved her spoiled, annoying dogs. 


She was one of those, These are my kids people. No offense to those who love their pets, but she took it to *extremes.* They would whine if they couldn't be in the same room as her, and would whine at their bedroom door ALL NIGHT LONG. Guess who had the ground-floor bedroom? Guess who slept upstairs, at the top of a long hallway and didn't have to listen to it?


New Wife is a cigarette smoker, and a drinker. My dad is a recovering alcoholic who hates cigarettes, and I have asthma. But, New Wife can smoke in the house, and so can her entirely family!


New Wife and her dogs became my dad's life. He would do nothing but post pictures on MySpace of her dogs, and soon I fell to the wayside. When her old dogs died, he bought her a new one, and that soon became the /u/Kahluka replacement.


Seriously, my dad would post about 5-10 pictures a day of the dog. He still does it, according to my cousin. He even made the dog a Facebook page, so he could post even more pictures. My mom started asking why the dog is his daughter, as that's what he would call her. He even changed his relationships on Facebook to list the dog as his kid.


So, I told him how I felt. We sat down, had some lunch. Said things would get better.


Months later, nothing has happened. I try to call, and he never answers. Text him and tell him I'm done being his kid if he doesn't want to be my dad. Long argument later, he sends me that fateful text.


My mom is a different story. She never dated when I was young, and until recently she never talked about anyone like this. At first, I was truly happy for her. Lisa is only a few years older than myself, and she hasn't come out of the closet yet, (She admits to close friends to being bi-sexual, but that's about it. To her parents, my mom is her roommate.) but she makes my mom happy. They're been together for *barely* a year, and they're already engaged.


My mom lives states and states away, but I finally got to see her after two long years this spring. She brought out Lisa and her 2 year-old, along with my grandma. I dragged along Boyfriend, who got to meet her for the first time.


Every conversation turned to Lisa. Isn't she beautiful? Isn't she amazing? I'm so happy, 'Luka. I really am. Isn't her daughter amazing? She's your new sister. Lisa's going to be like a mom to you, isn't she beautiful?


Seriously, if it wasn't about Lisa, it was about her daughter. I'd try to talk to her about something, ANYTHING, and it would all turn into, Isn't she *beautiful?*


I couldn't talk to her about my old home state, or how my life is going. I couldn't get through to her to talk about how she is, or when will she quit smoking? How about quitting drinking? Oh, Lisa's beautiful? Sure. Yeah.


Boyfriend pointed this out not too long ago. He told me that if we ever broke up, he would be afraid of what would happen to me. He told me he didn't really think anyone gave a shit about me. (Believe it or not, he said this in the nicest way possible.)


He pointed out that my mom wanted nothing to do with me, just Lisa. Did Lisa want something? Where did she want to go? Isn't she beautiful? (Seriously, every other sentence was that.)


I tried talking to her two days ago about the Boyfriend. Said I was sad, and she spouted off about Lisa. The incredible, amazing Lisa with an amazing daughter who is now also her daughter. She can do no wrong, she's never done any wrong. She can't believe she got so lucky. They set a date, did she tell me that? (She's told me nearly every conversation.)


After Lisa appeared, my mom just blew up and forgot all about me. I waited a minute, and then hung up. She tried calling the next day, but I ignored her call. I didn't want to hear about Lisa anymore.


Am I being a jealous little brat? Seriously. For years, Deanna chalked up my hatred of New Wife to simple, catty jealousy. But now, as I examine their behavior... I just feel replaced.

30527,Relationships,3bn0dz,"We have been together almost 5 years and married just over a year. We have lived together for 3 years. Previously, he was soley in charge of cleaning the bathrooms at our former residence and I dealt with laundry - washing/drying/folding/hanging/putting away. We split our rent and utilities and everything was fine. We  recently bought a house and we are both responsible for cleaning the bathrooms since there are now more of them. One week someone cleans the master (and most used bathroom) and the other person cleans the guest bathroom and the powder room. We switch off each week so its fair. 

The past few times that I have cleaned the master bathroom, my husband has started going in after I am done and  taking pictures of all the things he feels I didn't do right. A few water spots on the shower glass, some cleaner on the bottom corner of shower wall I missed when I was simultaneously showering and cleaning, water spots on the sink faucet from where I had brushed my teeth and accidently flung some water from the toothbrush onto the spout... 

I am not a messy person. Disorganized, yes. But I am not disgusting nor do I live in filth. I struggle with ADD so sometimes I miss the small things because I was distracted by something else at the time. 

I told him I hadn't finished cleaning before he ever looked at the bathroom. I only did part of it because I was waiting for the color in my hair to set. I cleaned the toilet, the counters, the sink, and the shower. I sprayed the shower stall down with cleaner while I scrubbed the toilet. I then jumped into the shower and got down on my knees to scrub the floor of the shower and the tile on the walls. I felt confident in my cleaning ability. I was also pretty distracted by our dog, who was whining and asking to be let out to potty. My plan was to do the tub, the floors, and the mirror today and be done with that chore for the week. 

He entered the bathroom after I was asleep and begun his investigation. He sent me a series of messages to my phone, along with the pictures, detailing how I did a half-assed job. You did a terrible job spot cleaning. If I didn't put in effort, it'd never get cleaned.  I took pictures because I knew you would pull this. When I clean, I move everything. I get down on my hands and scrubbed. You clearly just spot cleaned and missed 90% of what needed to be clean. I'm on strike. I'm not doing this until you own up and admit it and fix it. Its not fair to me and I'm not going to pick up slack

WHAT?  Why does he think this is how a husband should speak to his wife? Why is this a battle worth fighting? I love my husband but when he speaks to me this way, I feel so small and inferior. I do not feel like his equal. I have tried telling him this and he tells me that if I would do my part he wouldn't have to act like this towards me or take pictures. I am at a loss. I do not do this to him. If I see that he did a less than adequate job at cleaning something, I fix it without saying something if it bothers me too much to just leave it be. I don't critique his cleaning skills. And honestly, I am NOT half ass cleaning or trying to shuck my responsibilities on to him. I understand that I do not always possess the greatest attention to detail and that I make a lot of mistakes, but I feel like there is a better way to bring this to my attention. I want to feel like I have a husband, not a daddy or a boss. 

I also worry about what his overly critical behavior will mean once we have a child. Will our child grow up thinking they can never please their father and that nothing they do is ever good enough?


I would like some insight/suggestions as to how to handle the situation but please don't bash my husband. I love him. I feel like this behavior is not going to do us any relationship favors, but he feels totally justified. He takes very good care of me otherwise, I just feel like I cannot make him happy dispite my best efforts. He isn't a bad guy, he's just... set in his ways, I guess...

I will be using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.
Sorry for the long paragraphs, but I have a lot to say, and I want you guys to help me out decide what to do.
So, I am a 21 year old Male, and have NEVER had a girlfriend in the past or a kiss from a girl. I consider myself very shy, so although I have had a lot of crushes along the years, I have never had the guts to approach girls. Given this, the story I will tell you will sound a bit abnormal, which is why I am experiencing depression right now.


Let’s start! I am a junior in college and met a senior (22F) last semester in August, but did not talk to her until like October. We are both part of a program in school for engineering students (close knit community), and that is where I met her. Since day 1, I had a crush on her! One day, our program had a panel about racial topics, and at the end of the panel/debate, she felt a bit sad/depressed, and needed someone to talk to. So, we both talked around campus for 3 hours!!!! We talked about our feelings, our families, school, future goals, etc. She emailed me when I got home, and told me that she was impressed with the conversation we had. I continued seeing her around campus or in the program, and would say hi to each other. One day, I invited her to dinner. At first, she was a bit hesitant, but we ended up going. Again, we spent 3 hours together!!!! We talked a out so much stuff!!!



Then we had winter break, and she went back home (10 hours away), and I live near campus. I would email her, but she would ignore me. She returned back to school a week earlier than classes started (this January 2015) because she did not want to be back home. Once she was in the area, she text me and told me that she was in the area, and asked me if I wanted to hang out! Of course I said yes! We went hiking and spent the entire day together (9am-10pm!!!). She told me that she had a boyfriend of 2 years, and this was the first time hearing about it since having met her back last semester. Of course, those news made me a bit sad because I was planning on asking her out in a couple of weeks.
That day that we went hiking, she asked me if we could go hiking again the next day to a different trail!! We spent all of the next day together (9am-10pm!!) We would have some very DEEP conversations, and she would ask me to describe my perfect match, which was a question that took me by surprise. We would talk about relationships, etc. That day, I stayed at her apartment (we did not do anything). To speed this up, we went on more adventures together for 2 more days again, and each time I would sleep over at her place. So, I spent an entire week with her, and on our last day of adventures, she told me that we “were going to have a serious conversation” the next day. I immediately knew what she was talking about.



The next day, she asked me if I was ready to have the conversation…I told her that I loved her, but I did not want to break up any relationships. She told me that she also liked me, and that she never did truly love her boyfriend. She told me that I made her feel different/better in the one week that we spent together than her entire 2 years with her bf.


On the weekend, we spent more time together. We would kiss each other everywhere!, touch each other, undressed each other, almost had sex, etc. After I told her that I loved her, she called her bf, and broke up with him. She called her mom and told her about the situation, and the mom got fucking mad at her, and told her, “Are you sure you are making the right decision?!”


The mom’s comment made her doubt our relationship. Even though we had A LOT of places that we were going to go together, activities that we were going to do, etc, she started to doubt our connection. The next day in school, she decided to “break up” with me before even being a couple because she needed some time off (asked me for 1-2b months!), forget about her boyfriend, needed to be at peace with herself instead of feeling guilty about cheating on her boyfriend.


Fast forward to now, whenever I see her, she just says hi (now looks depressed and sad), does not give me a hug, and ignores my texts because “she needs her space”. Do you guys think I should forget about her and move on? Does she really like me? How long should I wait?! She told me that our break up was “for the best of us” and that she does not like to start new relationships with “old baggage” from the previous relationship. Should I wait for her to text me or should I text her in a month?
Thank you a lot!

15544,Relationships,2notaz,"This may be a little on the long side, I'm not so good at explaining in great detail and I don't really know what's relevant to say.. But I would love some advice! So I met this guy, lets call him, George, about 6 1/2 months ago. We met on an online dating site, my first time I've tried the online dating thing. We talked on the site for a week or so and he asked for me number, I gave it to him and we texted for a couple of days and we really hit it off. I had been on one date prior to all this and we had hit it off but as soon as we met in person I knew that it would never work out and never saw the guy again. George asked me out on a date and I agreed and I was very nervous about it. We went out and it went so GREAT! We really hit it off even more and I was excited to see him again soon. We went out a few times and it just kept getting better. After about 2 months we had an exclusivity talk, he had been off the dating website for a few weeks and I was still on, but wasn't checking it anymore as I was investing my time in George. 

To preface this next part, I just have to say I really enjoy being with people (in both romantic and friendship like relationships) that have views that are not all the same as my own. Its far more interesting and I like to learn new things whether we agree or not on the topic we're discussing. So, anyway, George and I had disagreed on a few things already. And I hadn't thought it was a big deal because they were not deal breaking life altering things. But some things now, 6 months later, I'm not sure that I can deal with them. For example, I have a 9 year old daughter who has yet to meet George. I am scared for a few reasons, one being that I don't want her to be attached to him if things don't work out and I'm very inexperienced as to when is a good time to introduce them to each other anyway. I had my daughter when I was 16 and immediately adulthood was thrust upon me. I no longer hung out with my friends. I worked and went to school and took care of my daughter on my own. So I did not get to expiernece my golden years so I have always planned to not have more children so that my 30s-40s could be about me, or me and my partner if thats how it went. I know it may be selfish of me to want that, but that's how I always saw my older years to be. George wants children badly. But I made this clear from the very beggining that I never wanted more children. And He never said anything about it. But now he mentions quite often that he would love to have a family and his own children. And I ALWAYS say, 'well, you know I don't want more kids' and he says he knows. It makes me uncomfortable because I feel like I'm investing time and emotions into this man who may end up being unhappy because he wont have children or our relationship wont work out because of that reason. 

We also disagree on a lot of minor things, but when all added together they are kind of important to me. I try to live my life being kind and trying to understand why people are in bad situations, why someone might be in a bad mood or do things they do. But he is not like that, he is impatient and he doesnt think people deserve second chances, but at the same time he said to me If I found out you ever cheated on me I would probably forgive you, and I asked why he would ever say that to me, and if I found out that he cheated on me I wouldn't forgive him and our relationship would be over. He said that he knows things can happen and if they ever did he loves me and it would take time, but he would forgive me. I would never cheat on him, I have never cheated on anyone I have been in a relation ship with and he told me that he has, but it had been years and years ago and he was a different person then. I told him that that made me really nervous and he said he wouldn't have brought it up if he was going to cheat on me. 

There's just a lot of weird things like that, that I'm not sure about and that put doubts in my mind. The whole reason that this is a difficult decision for me to make is because the way he makes me feel when we are together is just simply amazing. He makes me feel loved and cared about and we have great conversations for hours and never run out of things to say. Our love life is amazing and he makes me feel like no one has ever made me feel before. I just don't know if these things are something I should be worried about or not. I have tried to talk to him a few times now about certain things, and we did talk it out. But he is very uncomfortable talking about his feelings and expressing the way he feels about a LOT of things. He had told me things about his childhood that make me think he was never able to express himself and when he did he was beaten down mentally and physically for that. But I am a very open person and when I feel worried upset or happy and excited about something I want to talk about it to my partner. And that is not the case with him.. I just don't know if I should stick it out longer and see if he opens up or if these issues are too big all together and I should cut it off before I become even more emotionally invested.. Thanks in advance!

This is a throwaway, because I would like to keep this private and a friend of mine occasionally checks my history on my main account.

My girlfriend [22/F] and I [22/M] have been together for 3 years at this point. We have never had any sort of major issue in the past.

About 2 months ago, she asked what I thought about her, and 3 of her friends (two of which are 22, one is 21) going to...a popular city in the US that is famous for casinos(sorry for vagueness, just really don't want anyone finding this). I told her I thought it was a terrible idea, especially since they planned to spend the day tanning by the pool and then go out to the clubs at night. If you could guess what city I was talking about, you may be able to understand why I wasn't ok with that.

She also told me the timeframe that they wanted to go (this week), which made me even more against the idea because it happened to be the week that my work is going through a major conversion to a new infomatics core system (I work in IT), and I would already be under severe stress due to that. That was the end of the conversation for that time.

About a month and a half ago she brought it up again, and I asked her to please, not go with just three other girls, all of which have never been to that city. She promised me she wouldn't and maybe next year.

Then, 2 weeks ago, out of the blue after being told the plans were cancelled. She tells me she booked her flight. I asked what happened to not going, and she told me that her three friends said that she should go anyway even though I asked her not to. She told me this while I was at work, so I didn't really have a chance to argue about it.

She left Sunday morning. Everything was fine Sunday. They checked into the hotel, and went to the casino that is attached to it. But then today, I texted her to ask how her day was going. She responded with, My boobs are sunburned. I asked how they got sunburned, and she said they had been tanning by the pool. I told her that at least it would only be the top of her chest that got burned, and she said no, her entire breasts were burned. I asked how that happened, and she said the pool wasn't that busy so we decided to tan topless so we wouldn't have tan lines. Going off the words wasn't that busy I think its safe to assume that there were other people there who saw her, and her friends.

She was in a hurry to get to the casino so I wasn't able to tell her I had a problem with it at that time. She texted me later to tell me they were going out for the night and would be back to the hotel room in the morning. I asked what the hell they were thinking, going out to bars and clubs all night in **that** city. She told me that I worry too much. I then told her I wasn't happy about her tanning topless at a public pool, which she has since ignored.

I'm not sure if I'm in the right here, being upset that she would take her top off in a public setting, where other men would be able to clearly see her breasts. I'm very upset by the fact that she would do that, and then ignore me when I say I'm not comfortable with that. I'm under a lot of stress this week, and probably don't even have the time to spare to be typing this, but I honestly don't know what I should do at this point. I'm both worried about her safety, and angry that she would do something like this. Any advice would truly be appreciated because I don't know what to do.

Some back story is required pretty much everyone at my small IT takes an irreverent approach to humor (Cards against Humanity is a common game at company events).  My girlfriend is what I would describe as a feminist but I've never actually seen her get offended about a joke.

Anyway, just as a pro-cation, I warn her that things could get beyond her taste at said party and we establish safe word for if she wants to leave.  We go to the party where everyone else had been drinking a bit and were playing a fairly non-politically correct card game (Lots of jokes about sex, dirty things, one guy I didn't know said something about rape ounce or twice that I did not find funny).

She pretends to have a good time, looks at her phone a lot plays along with the game... all is well with the world... or so I think.   We leave around 2am and she informs me that she felt extremely uncomfortable the entire time and was extremely offended and doesn't talk to me the entire ride home.  Once we get home, she tells me she can't believe I was laughing at some of the jokes that were told during the game and she can't believe I couldn't tell she was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.  She also brought up that she broke up with a past boyfriend for doing something similar... she brought this up six times.

She never once informed me that she wanted to leave nor brought up the safe word we established.  She came over and apologized profusely the next day but I still can't help feeling crushed.  I'm not sure where to go from here.  I feel like the bringing up of her past break up was very threatening and I can't get some of the incredibly hurtful things she said out of my head.

(I think she thinks the age of consent is 21.) And she definitely wouldn't approve of me staying overnight with him (she is a devout Catholic) or going on a trip with him.

The problem is, I don't know how long I can hide it. I talk to her pretty much every day and it's getting difficult and frustrating to constantly make up lies about what I'm actually doing. I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong, so I don't know why it has to be such a shady thing. But, again, like I said, I know she would freak out if she knew the truth.

Just as an example of how she acts, when she found out my sister moved in with her boyfriend of 3 years, she cried for several days and was extremely upset. And there was no age difference there to complicate matters more. 


What should I do?

14494,Relationships,3i4luh,"I [19 F] have been dating my 22 year old boyfriend for about nine months. In most aspects, our relationship is pretty perfect. We are both private people. Most times we would both rather stay home and watch movies or cuddle than go on dates. We really only go on dates if it is a special occasion or if there is a movie out that we really would like to see. This is how I prefer things, I'm pretty home-bodied.

We are also both pretty guarded, I knew I loved him pretty early on in our relationship but we never even said the words I love you until pretty recently. I love him a lot, and I know he loves me a lot. However I am having a hard time coping with the fact that he seems to not want me involved or a part of other aspects of his life.

I'm very close with my (immediate) family. I've always dealt with depression and eating disorders so my parents became my best friends in the times that I couldn't go out and have normal friendships. He, on the other hand, doesn't seem to have a close relationship with his family. I am always telling him stories about my family and about my life before him, but he never really ever talks about his unless I ask questions--and even then he is very vague. I know his parents divorced when he was very young, and his father is remarried, and I know he has two siblings--but other than that I do not know much at all. I know nothing of his mother. 

My parents have been wanting to meet him because of how highly I speak of him. They know how important he is to me and they want to see for themselves the great guy I have been talking non stop about for this whole year. Every other relationship I have had, I have been close with the families of my boyfriend. I dated two guys, both for a couple years, in highschool and I was very close with their families. It felt like I was one of the family. 

I recently have been hinting that I want to meet his family, and that I would like for him to meet mine, but he always brushes it off and gets weirded out at my suggestions. Today he made a comment about not wanting his sister's boyfriend to come around and I said Babe how would you feel if she said that about me? And he said If you really want to meet my family we can go out to dinner or something but I really like to keep the two things separate. I think its weird that you want to meet my family, and I get uncomfortable around other people's families.

I would never want him to feel uncomfortable, and I would never want to pressure him into something, but I can't help that it really hurts me that he doesn't want me to be a full part of his life or him to be a full part of mine. I feel kind of expendable, like maybe he has the mentality that if I meet his family I've become too close to him. But like I said, he is a very guarded person (even more so than I) and he has whole heartedly professed his love to me and I know for a fact how much he cares for me.

It just really hurts my feelings that it seems he does not want to meet my family, who are a big part of my life, and does not want me around his family. 




TL;DR: Boyfriend and I are in committed relationship, but he does not want to meet my family or have me meet his. This hurts me pretty badly.

10482,Breakups,2eno7c,"I'd been with this girl for three years. She lives 300 miles away from me and we met online. Things were great for the first year. We missed each other a lot and couldn't wait for the next time to see each other. The next year was much the same, except we got more comfortable in not seeing each other so often. The third year is where I guess it goes downhill. 

We see each other every 1-2 months for around 10 days at a time. She's going to University just as I go into my final year, so we're still going to be distant even after I graduate (September 2013). We question whether it'll be a good idea for us to be together. At this time we still love each other and decide to continue on and hope for the best.

Of course, much of our relationships is based online. We'd Skype and play a lot of different games together, watch movies, etc all online. Up until recently we could tell things were a little stale. Last week or so we had a huge talk about whether it'll be right for us to continue our relationship. I personally was willing to do anything to try and mend our relationship. For the past 6 months or so I haven't been bothered to Webcam with her or anything, instead just playing games using other voice software. I guess this made the distance thing even worse and I didn't realise it. I was comfortable in the relationship, she wasn't. 

Now the last straw is that she doesn't feel she can deal with the distance anymore. She said she'd give it some more time and we pretty much arranged for her to come down to see me for her birthday (15th September). However, she was just doing this not to hurt my feelings, knowing that she in fact never really wanted that. She was too miserable to carry on and only today told me that her feelings for me aren't as strong as they were. I take this as she doesn't love me anymore, as she's not willing to give it a chance or try fix it.

As well as this, she recently started speaking to a guy that almost ended our relationship. I found out she was overly flirty with him and even said the words I felt like I wanted to kiss you before we left each other to him. This was about 2 years ago and the relationship almost ended right there. She is adamant she's not interested in this guy, but it seems coincidental that she'd start talking to him within the last few days again.

Now, this is the part that I can't deal with. All I'm going to think is that she's going to run off with this guy and it pains me more than anything right now. I'll never see her again considering she lives over 300 miles away and she'll quite simply vanish from my life. I really don't want this as I do still love her. Everything I do online reminds me of her, because that's pretty much where our relationship lies. I really don't know what to do now. I can't do anything online without feeling sick or almost breaking down.

20588,Breakups,2cxj1t,"Hello everyone,

So I met my best friend about a year and a half ago and we became close instantly. She at the time had a 33 year old boyfriend. However, we always had a close bond. See each other about 4 times a week, more than she would see her boyfriend, and we became so close to each other. More like family. 

About 5 months in I developed feelings for her, but loved her as a friend enough to respect her and not bring it up. Until she broke up. I feel horrible about doing this because I took her best friend away from her when she needed it the most and tried to replace him with another prospect. I was sure to comfort her in the time and add no pressure to the situation, but it was so hard to keep quiet as she was already going out to coffee with guys, and I didnt want to miss out so I followed my heart.

She eventually tells me she has had feelings the hole time, but cant get into a relationship. I say thats okay. We begin cuddling and getting close anyways but not too close, she would often flirt then deny me further physical expression.  I tell her that I get it, but if we are to do this, its all or nothing, no weird flirty phase. She eventually wanted to stop fighting her feelings and we hooked up the next night. For the next month I was extremely happy. Except for one small fallout in the middle where she got insecure about satisfying me sexually, which I was able to fix and move on from a couple of days later. Cut back to last Sunday, everything is great. Than I find out on Monday she had a conversation from an older friend. Said friend tell her to be careful, that she married her best friend, now has a kid and regrets it. At first she says it didn't bother her but as she thought about it more and more she got scared. So we talk that night and I encourage her to say we shouldn't do this anymore, and she is balling her eyes out. She said she wanted to make sure I wasn't her safety blanket. She said after all she went through (mother cancer, grandfather who was close to her died, father left family for other family, father came back a couple months before this but was gone for 2 years, bad ex boyfriend) so she said she managed to turn off all of her feelings. Completely. Didnt even bother her when she broke up with the ex, cried for 5 minutes than stopped. But she said I was the only one who made her feel anything this last month, the only person she cares about, and that she never cries. I hug her, but cant help but show how hurt and crushed I am. She tells me to take time. The entire relationship, I promised her we would maintain our friendship if it didn't work out. She also frequently expressed how she didn't want to hurt me. She was completely into out relationship, than the next poof. She also expressed how she didn't want me to become dependent on her for my happiness. I say some stupid stuff on the way home.

Cut to 2 Am she retweets maybe 50 tweets from this twitter account that go from I miss you to I only care about you. Then come few tweets that say they will only miss you when they see how well you are doing i don't like it when people rely on people for their happiness. Get your own lives and make yourself happy!. Over the past couple of days she has been normal on social media otherwise. In the morning I also texted her that I think she made the right decision (I do) that I feel better now that I have slept,and that taking time is a good idea.  talk to you in a while. She tells me im glad you feel better and slept well. I'm glad you understand. take care. and it has been a day and a bit since.

But I don't want the relationship back. I just want my friend back. I want the person I would hang out with all the time. I want an older sister to my little sister. I want to go back to being friends and truly appreciate her for what she has done for me. I am ready to see her move on to other guys and I to girls. I realize this entire time that I care for her like a sister, that I want her o be happy, and that She can do the same for me. 

Is this possible? How long should I wait? I fear if I wait to long she will associate me with the pain she if feeling and not want to be friends. I am lost and heart broken, in a way I never expected to be.

As a side not I know I can move on from this. That i can live my life, keep busy and eventually not be hurt anymore. But I feel its worth a shot. She can only improve my life. Its not incomplete without her, but I just want my friend back.

I was supposed to be out of town from Monday to the following Tuesday for a trip and my sister's birthday. My boyfriend cheated on me after one day of me being gone. This isn't the first time I've let this summer as schools out and he can't get off work as easily as I can. He called me the night of the same day it happened and I really do feel like we can move past this but I also have this feeling that I should punish him. Like make him sleep on the couch for awhile and definitely no sex because I'm hurt and I don't want things to go back to normal too quickly and he sees his actions as okay.

7003,Non-Romantic,2d1sru,"My best friend, let's call her Mandy, and I have been best friends since first grade. But the thing is, after third grade she moved away but we still somewhat kept in touch, and around middle school we became really good friends again. We still lived about an hour away, but through MSN, Facebook, Skype, texting, etc we managed to stay in good touch with each other. We wouldn't see each other in person very often but enough that I would visit her or she would visit during school breaks or we would go to each other's birthdays and stuff like that. 


The thing is, in this time, we've kind of grown up to be very different people. And this isn't really a big deal to me, I'm friends with lots of different kinds of people, but she doesn't really seem like she's grown at all... Mandy has become immature, attention seeking, rude, unforgiving, and worst of all, she tries to appear open minded but she really isn't. 


A lot of my friends that have met her at birthday parties or gatherings don't really like Mandy because she makes no effort to get to know them. Which is okay, I get it, she has a lot of social anxiety. I tell my friends that, but they do have a point. My last birthday I just invited a few friends over to just hang out and she just lay down on my couch and played with her DS and covered herself up with a blanket. If someone tried to talk to her she wouldn't talk to them and instead shoot them down. When we playing cards against humanity she wouldn't talk, but would instead make animal noises occasionally. Which is kind of endearing when you're 7, but 17? 


She doesn't even give my friends a chance. My birthday party before that some of my friends said they tried to talk to her but she would be rude and they were hurt. They were just trying to be nice and make conversation, and instead now they just ignore her and said they had a much better time. 


Even this guy I became really close friends with that she had introduced me to, I invited him to hang out with me and he was glad to, until he learned she was going... He said she makes him uncomfortable and didn't want to go. 


Instead, I spent today hanging out with her and her friend visiting from another country and her cousin who just moved here from another country. I played tour guide. When we met up she told me she didn't eat breakfast (it was almost 1 at that point) and I told her okay, there's this really good area that we're going to that'll have tons of food, you should wait until then. But first we're going to go to this big mall to show your friends (tourist attraction) so if you want to eat here you can. I remind her this multiple times, I even ask her if she wants to eat street meat, and she says no, she'll wait.


Well, I tell her it's going to take some time, like 20 minutes walking, and she says it's okay. So we walk there, and she's sighing and complaining about being hungry, and we get to Chinatown (passing through, but a great tourist sight). She doesn't eat Chinese food, she says it doesn't agree with her, but she's never liked it because she thinks its gross. Whatever, I knew that, I figure we could continue on, the market we're going to has tons of unique restaurants and culture that I'm sure we can find something everyone can enjoy...


No dice. We walk around the market, and she's getting more and more agitated because she's hungry. The thing is, she's the reason we aren't eating at any restaurant. I look at the menu outside and I say that it might be a vegetarian restaurant. No, she needs to eat meat. She loves meat. She thinks vegetarian/vegan food is gross. Okay, that's not her thing, I get it, I know her, she likes meat. But she's not even willing to try anything new? It's not like vegetarian food is all salad. It's pretty diverse, even vegan food. I wasn't forcing anything on her, I just suggested places as we passed them, and she would say no to every one of them. I would ask her what she wanted to eat, but she said she didn't know. I would ask her if there was anything specific she felt like, and she said there wasn't. Like what do you expect me to do? 


Okay, well I know there's tons of food options past that restaurant so we keep walking. She said she feels like meat. We walk in front of a really popular and good Jerk Chicken place, and I suggest here. She says no, doesn't even give a good reason why (she likes spicy food, so that's not it), and I suspect it's because she's never had it and isn't willing to tr anything new. There's Indian food, Jamaican food, Thai food, Tex Mex, Mexican, Portuguese, fusion foods, etc... Tons of different kinds of restaurants with tons of really great food, and she says no to all of them. And shes getting mad at ME for not being able to find her something to eat. She acts like she's so open minded because she's gay and I hate to call her one but sometimes she reminds me of the stereotype of a Tumblr Social Justice Warrior. She's NEVER willing to try anything new and she's so stubborn. She wanted to go to a steak house to eat. Looking at where we were, there are no steakhouses because that's not the kind of demographic this market is. We end up standing on the sidewalk, I'm looking up restaurants in the area on my phone, and she's angry because she's hungry. It's all about her. I ask everyone else what they feel like and they don't really know. We had to spend like 15 minutes surrounding her and babying her because she was grumpy and upset she couldn't eat anything.


We ended up going to this dive bar kind of place, that serves pretty american food. Sandwiches, breakfast, wings, soup, etc. She gets chicken wings and a grilled cheese. I get a brie and avocado sandwich, and her cousin and friend get wings too. It was really nice of her though, she picked up the bill, for us as a treat. 


I just feel like today was really immature of her and there are many other times where she's acted childish but I've never really minded. Today it bugged me though, especially since the close friend of mine said he didn't want to hang out with me since she was coming. 


Honestly, we don't even talk that much anymore, but I do love her and care about her because we've been friends for so long. We don't even have anything really in common. Our mutual best friend tells me stuff that she can't tell her because she knows she'll get preachy and judgemental. She was afraid to introduce her to her ex-boyfriend when they first started dating because Mandy never approves and is always rude to the guys.


Honestly, we're going to different universities, and we're probably not going to see each other much. Our schools are in the same city though so it's not like it's impossible, but I don't know if I'm overreacting about today or not. I mean she's been a good friend to me, but this is just one example of the things that she does. It's something I feel like she should know better than by now. What do I do? 
---   
**tl;dr**: My friend Mandy since first grade hasn't really grown up much since then. She says she has social anxiety but whenever my friends try to talk to her she doesn't put any effort or she is rude to them. My friends don't like her.


Today I played tour guide for her friend visiting from another country and her cousin who just moved here from another country and her. She acted very immaturely when I brought her to a market with TONS of different restaurants and she got mad at me because she was hungry and couldn't eat anything because she 'didn't want it'. I tried asking what she felt like and she just said she wanted to eat meat and I suggested restaurants that would have meat (ie the jerk chicken place) and she would turn them all down. Then she would get angry at me and grumpy because I couldn't find her anything to eat. 


She remains closed minded and immature, and I don't know how to deal with this. I love her a lot, so am I overreacting or do I need to separate myself from her? Or should I talk to her about this? What do I do?

28643,Relationships,3ckjjf,"Hi reddit, I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm sorry if this isn't the most coherent post, I'm sort of just spilling my feelings here. 

I started dating my current SO in high school (he was 14 and I was 15) We are each others first everything (kiss, first time etc.) So over the last 8 years we have become very close.

I am a somewhat bicurious girl, I sometimes masturbate to lesbian porn and become aroused when I see an attractive female, but I personally never saw myself in a long term relationship with one. 

My SO came out to me around 3 years ago now, and I am accepting of her situation. She has not begun hormones but she has amassed quite the female wardrobe and I'm helping her to learn how to put on makeup and other girly behaviors. She does not dress as a woman full time because she is having trouble coming out to her parents, but some of our mutual friends know about her circumstance.

When my SO first came out to me, I felt very angry and betrayed. Then after a feeling of loss and grieving started...which is still present today. I am not able to find much information on partners of people who come out as transgender in a relationship so I'm not sure if my feelings are normal. 

I don't have a problem with transgenderism or anyone who feels that they are, if my SO and I were to be just platonic friends this wouldn't be a problem. The relationship side of this is what is getting at me. I have always wanted to take pride in being a good girlfriend/wife etc. for a man. I find women attractive, but I personally have never wanted to date one (an outwardly presented one anyway). With my SO coming out, I feel like I've lost my identity as 'the woman' in the relationship. I love my SO dearly, I'm closer to her than anyone else in my life and that makes everything hurt so bad. I feel bad for desiring being with a man, my SO tells me that I shouldn't feel bad for that, but I do. 

Now about 5 months ago, I became introduced to a group of friends from my SO and there is this one man who I particularly click very well with. He is 21 and is recently divorced (he married his girlfriend of 7 years at the time to give her citizenship) and he is out and dating again. We are good friends and we understand each other on many different topics. My SO told me before introducing us that this man and I would be great friends because we are so similar. Once I met him I just felt this attraction; he is good looking, funny, smart and kind. We also both have social anxiety (to differing degrees) so we are very much in sync with our feelings and reactions when we are out in person together. 

Now, I have been dealing with these feelings about my situation with my SO for a while now, and I have encountered many single men in that time and have not noticed them in 'that way'. This guy is the first that I am feeling this way towards. 

My SO and I are very open and honest with each other, we try to not have any secrets. I have told her about these feelings and we have talked things through in great lengths. My SO says that, although it hurts to hear, she understands my feelings and just wants me to be happy. She has told me that if I had to be with any man, she would rather it be this guy because she has known him for a while and knows he would be good to me.

Another issue in my relationship is that my SO's libido has always been lower than mine. Once she came out it made sense, she is not happy with her body therefore she doesn't want to have sex/be intimate as often as I do. This was also always difficult to deal with because I always put more emphasis on physical intimacy because it is something I need in a relationship to feel desired and sexy. This is a problem now more than before because it feels like my SO and I are after the same thing in the bedroom (being 'taken' / needing to know that we are desired) and I feel like it leaves us feeling frustrated. I have also read that sometimes taking estrogen can decrease the libido even more, which is something that I worry about as well. 

I'm very confused and I don't have any people to go to except my SO to sort through this. I don't want to invade on any friendships and ruin anything for my SO and her friend and for me and this guy, he doesn't know my feelings for him. At the same time I don't know what it is like being in a relationship with a transgendered person, I am worried that I will start to feel worse if and when my SO starts her hormones. I am trying to consider my own happiness because if my SO encounters any bad reactions I have to keep my mental health in check because I want to be able to defend her, as I am very protective of her. My SO and I are very much the best of friends, and I love her dearly. Every time that I think of either just not being in a relationship with her or being with another person it kills me to think about her being relationship-less and by herself. It also hurts me to think about not being able to hug her and cuddle with her anymore. But at the same time, I know it sounds shallow, but her appearance is changing (and will continue to do so) and I feel like the person I was physically attracted to is dead, and I am left with an excellent, dear friend...but just that, only a friend. I am attracted to my SO when she is dressed in her girl clothes, she is very attractive, I guess maybe I'm desiring more of a male demeanor in a partner.

(Part of it was because she was leaving, the rest because we still had a lot of childish personality flaws. (We were only 17 when we started dating.))

So we separated and, because of the time differences, we didn't really talk while she was there. In the meantime, I headed off to college and we did our own things.

Now she's back and we met to catch up a bit. It seems like she has gotten over me (even having a small romance while she was away), and I've learned I'm still not over her.

Here's the thing that prevents me from just dropping all contact with her. She is also my best friend (I know, kinda weird to say that about your ex.). We shared secrets and struggles with each other that we'd never shared with anyone else. (Her father was abusive.....and I'm gonna leave it at that. My father was a selfish narcissist.) We'd became incredibly close friends while we dated and that friendship is still there.

My only issue with our relationship now is that I still have feelings for her, while she is over me in a romantic sense. I don't want this to cause problems in either of our lives, but I also refuse to break all ties with her for something as small as this.

 We all went to uni together and Tim and I become best friends from day one. Kerry lived next door and inmediatley fell for Tim even though he had a girlfriend- they ended up together after Tim left his girlfriend.


This didn't make me so keen on Kerry and along with a few personality clashes and the fact she used to stay over at our house a little too much for my comfort, we had a tense friendship for the first year or so. Here we are 4 years on and we are all very close, along with the rest of our friendship group.



Tim is...a writer and has a very dramatic, romanticised, struggling artist kind of personality to go along with it. He is always searching for himself which can make him slightly patronising and pedantic sometimes. In confidence, he talks about his relationship to me and has on occasion, made it clear that while he cares for Kerry, he's not sure she's the one and he finds himself disappointed that she's not as smart/thin/ exotic as the kind of future wife he's always imagined. 

Kerry ,however, is extremely dedicated to him and has been very supportive throughout their relationship.


Enter Emma, another close friend of mine. She is beautiful, smart and interesting but is a little damaged- she's currently in an on/off again abusive relationship with another woman (she is bi) and she has a pretty bad drinking problem. Her and Tim have always gotten on very well and there's always been a spark (lots of in another life- us two would be soul mates conversations) which has bordered on inappropriate when their respective partners aren't around.


I have always warned them both individually about keeping things above board and while I have been privy to their interactions, I've never seen anything that would make me have to step in.

Que last night; it's my birthday party and everyone is gathered at mine. A few hours into the party, Emma makes a surprise appearance (she initially was double booked) and I'm thrilled to have her there. The night goes well but I notice she seems to be getting drunk a little too quickly. She chats away to everyone and I see her and Kerry having a good chin wag. An hour or so later, I walk past my hall way and I see her and Tim standing very closely while she is drunkly confessing her feelings to him.



I get my so to subtly break it up, get Emma in a taxi and give Tim the eye whilst distracting Kerry from what's quietly happening. Tim then corners me and goes on a rant about Emma is messing with his head and she is the devil before admitting that 6 months before they had secretly met up for drinks and had ended up kissing and discussing potentially running away together. I tell him he's just as bad as her- tell him to sort his head out and I go and try and enjoy the rest of my birthday.


By now, Kerry has noticed all the private conversations arising and asks me and a mutual friend (who Tim has also told) what's happening. She tells me she saw Tim and Emma and was concerned. I make an excuse to go to the bathroom and run into Tim. I tell him that he needs to tell Kerry what's happened because I feel I am lying by omission. I make it VERY CLEAR that that conversation should happen ANOTHER DAY when everyone is sober and NOT tonight.


I'm sure you can guess the rest. Tim goes straight outside and tells Kerry at 3am in my back garden that he cheated on her with Emily. She becomes hysterical- us girls look after her and Tim goes to the men. Kerry tearfully tells us that this is the 3rd girl he's kissed and she knows he's messaged countless others. 
I have heard about all of these girls by Tim has dumbed it down A LOT to me and I must admit that two of these occasions happened around the time I didn't care so much for Kerry so I hadn't really cared At the time.
Hearing all the details and seeing how heart broken Kerry was really hit me- I now realise that my very best friend is actually a skeezy fuck. 



I get Kerry settled in the spare room and comfort her. Tim goes to talk to her before going in a taxi home. As he's leaving, we have the following conversation:

T- sorry about tonight. I know it's ruined your birthday. Me and K kissed goodbye so I think we will be ok
ME- you don't deserve to be forgiven
T- well, I don't know what she's told you- you know how insecure she is.
ME- she told me every story and I know that it's all true.
T- ok..I'm no angel but hey, the amount I cheated on her isn't as bad as on my last ex.




I told him to go home and spent the rest of the night holding Kerry. Same again this morning before she went home to him.
I contacted Emma and told her how disappointed I am in her behaviour and she needs to seek help with her drinking. She is upset and has agreed/apologised but I think I'll be taking a break from our friendship.



Tim keeps trying to contact me because naturally, as his best friend, normally it's me he comes to with his problems. I can't get my head around the fact that he could be so selfish, disgusting and cruel to his girlfriend and I'm not sure that I can remain friends with someone like that. But i know Kerry will probably go back to him and he will expect me to forgive him too.



In the past, I have been bad and Tim has reprimanded me for the drama I've brought to the table so I have feeling he will expect me to forgive him the way he's forgiven me but I'm not sure I can. 


Reddit, how do you act when you find out  that not one but two of your closest friends are morally despicable people? How do I behave around this if T and K get back together and E gets help? Is it any of my business to be upset by this or do I just go with the flow? Also, I know it's petty but this all fucking ruined my birthday.

Shes had a best friend for just as long and they have had more falling outs in their 2.5 years of living together than me and my girlfriend have had rough patches. (we have worked through it with communication).

This year she claimed that her roommate has really improved (less promiscuous, manipulative, and talking behind her back), and I tend to agree with this. Because of this though, my girlfriend has been spending almost all of her free time, time studying, time working out, and time eating with her roommate. They are best friends, nothing wrong with that. 

This year I noticed a trend of asking my girlfriend if she wanted to spend time together on relatively short notice and she would already have small plans with her roommate. It's a crap shoot if our schedules will allow us to see each other on the weekends, so I realized in order to spend time with her I would have to make real plans to do so. I asked her if she liked the idea of a date night (one night on a weekday that we have the night to ourselves).That way we can plan ahead even if we will have an exam or paper due the next day. She loved it and we agreed on a day that worked best for us. 

The first one was coming up and it was the weekend of her roommate's birthday so she made plans to be with her Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night (conflicting with date night). I was invited to the party Saturday but couldn't make it, because of work.

I wasn't angry about this and figured it was a special occasion and understandable.

Now she has made plans to go to an event with the same roommate during date night this week. I'm hurt and feel like I'm the only one trying to make time for us in the relationship. I want to talk to her about it but want your guys opinion on the situation.

My girlfriend is only the third girl I've ever been with sexually and the first honestly serious relationship I've had, and it's beginning to scare me that it may be the only relationship I'll have. Over the past year, with college and meeting people outside of the depths of high school, I've had a confidence boost and a little bit of a sexual awakening.


And I think that is causing me to want to try new things, and meet new people, because I'm not sure my current girlfriend is my exact type, and while we are fairly sexually compatible, I find myself feeling more and more unsatisfied and more and more attracted to other types of women.

More specifically, I find myself more on the sexually... submissive side, and my girlfriend is also more submissive and is barely comfortable taking charge while on top. Without getting into too graphic of sexual fetish detail, it's stressful and unsatisfying to me to be in charge in everything we do.

Whereas we used to talk about spending forever together and marriage and kids and whatever after college, everything feels so terrifying to me now and I'm even uncertain about my personal future, let alone one with someone else.

My boyfriend, Michael, and I met and got together when we were both 18. He was not my first long term boyfriend and I was not his first girlfriend, though I have reason to believe this is the first relationship that has held any real meaning to him. At the time we met, I was working as a trainee hairdresser and he was unemployed. This didn't seem very strange to me then because we were both so young and obviously still figuring out what we wanted to do. Even though I had a very clear direction in which to sink my efforts (hairdressing) and a solid sense of what I wanted to achieve, it didn't concern or worry me that Michael did not. I didn't expect him to know exactly what he wanted to do at that point in time and neither did anyone else.



Even back then, though, when we were 18, I noticed that Michael had a very stand-offish attitude towards anything that didn't quite adhere to his private agenda and lifestyle choices. Michael is heavily into metal music-- death metal-- and has always played and written that kind of music for as long as I've known him. He also has very long hair. Luckily that's no big deal. I'm very into long hair on guys and love a man who's passionate about his interests, even if they in no way align with my own (and trust me, there are very few people who are as into their shit as metal guitarists). Michael is also loyal, generous, patient, incredibly clever, honorable, hilarious and unfalteringly kind to everyone he knows. I love and admire him, get on famously with his parents and three brothers, and generally have never really seen any of his flaws as deal breakers  at all until now, when life has put some pressure on and Michael can't seem to grow up.


The problem is, when we first got together, it quickly became clear that metal music was Michael's one and **only** interest. Where as back then it seemed fantastic to me that he was so determined, this is now quite  literally his only choice when it comes to picking a future. Michael is very vocal about his disdain for other career paths and quite snobbish about common jobs like working in a supermarket and working in an office 9 till 5. From what I can tell, part of this is because he genuinely believes he can do better than that (and certainly can, if you ask me) but also because Michael has essentially written himself off as unemployable due to his extreme social anxiety and other mental health problems. 


Michael can get up and play in front of a screaming crowd for hours on end  no problem, but stick him in a small room with other people and he begins to crumble. He has also had severe bouts of OCD throughout his life, which, though they fade away for a time, never quite disappear. Food shopping is a torturous process for him (and me) because he struggles so much being out and spending money-- another anxiety of his. He can whittle away hours agonising over minor purchases (this cheese or that) and simple things like writing applications and filling out forms can literally take days and many, many frustrated outbursts. From what I've learned and heard from his family, I believe  they and Micaheal are all somewhat autistic. He certainly shows the signs of autism and dyslexia, though he has adamantly refused to seek help or be diagnosed despite admitting it's almost certainly true-- and it's not like I want it labelled either, I just think he'd benefit from getting some help.


The bottom line is, Michael isn't particularly well suited to working with or around other people and, as such, is generally quite unemployable. On top of this, his relative success with his music seems to have cemented his decision to simply do what he always wanted--to chase his dreams of becoming a famous metal guitarist. Now I have always, **always** supported Michael in his dream. I attend his concerts, I spread news about his successes, help him buy equipment, set up his gigs, encourage and listen to him in any way I can-- as he does me with my hobbies- but his dreams are now driving  a wedge between us because, now, our priorities seem completely different. 


You see, I've never experienced any of the same problems Michael has. I've always worked anywhere I could-- worked in supermarkets, cafes, as a volunteer, dog's body, literally anything-- and Michael has often expressed frustration on my behalf when I've taken jobs he thinks aren't good enough for me or in places where I am undervalued and unappreciated. Even the job I have now he thinks is shit, and when I brought up in conversation that could seem myself working there for at least 5 years he was really upset and dismayed. He himself also works at the moment, but only out of desperation and only with family. He did have a job sixth months ago working as a pot washer in a cafe and it nearly killed him, his anxiety and stress levels were so bad. Later, he got work with his brother logging and maintaining landscapes in the woods of a mountainous region a few hours away from where we live, and though this is pretty ideal for him as far as a job is concerned (no people, fresh air, hard labor) and is the best thing to happen to us in a while, it in no way suits our plans.


I work full time in a store two hours from where Michael's bro works. Michael's work is only contract based. My job has prospects in management and I thoroughly enjoy what I do, where as Michael (while fit) doesn't think he can see himself pursuing the landscape work long-term because he's simply too anxious. Being a hypochondriac he gets worked up over the slightest injury (to anyone, including me), and so working in that environment like the one he's currently in is wearing him down. He also maintains two bands closer to where we live (one minor, the other quite successful) and so us moving away, me quitting my job, and him working for his brother long-term makes absolutely no sense. 


It's been months now, and I'm still working where I was and Michael is still struggling to figure out what he wants to do. He knows he can't stay logging but seems to be using his brother's work to delay finding a different job closer to home, and his contract is rapidly coming to an end. When Michael does buck up and look for work nearby, it's only for similar out-door work to that he's already doing, which, frankly, isn't easy to come by in our area and wouldn't suit him anyway as he's already decided he doesn't want to do it. 


Meanwhile, over the last sixth months, I've tried to compromise. First by making suggestions for how he can make his musical career actually feasible (he doesn't like twitter, won't self-promote, has no online presence, won't advertise, won't finish projects, won't publish anything unless it's exquisite) and next by making reasonable suggestions towards jobs that are a little more stable. I've tried to coax him into applying for things that make sense, things he agrees would work and he could do, but and each time he finds a reason not to pursue them, be it because they impede his musical dreams or because he simply doesn't like the idea of them after all. While frustrated, I adore this man and that last thing I want is to hurt him or stress him out more than he already is. That said, I've tried everything I can think off to put some fire under him. I've made jokes, suggestions, made plans with him, berated him, cried, been cold, been loving, been indifferent and so far nothing has made the slightest bit of difference. Michael is well aware of his problems and sees himself as nothing but a dead-weight in my life (as do my entire family and they make no attempt to hide it) and though I constantly tell him I love him and support him, that I'm proud of him and want him to be happy, the truth is that my heart is breaking. 



The women in my family have a genetic predisposition for breast cancer and because of this, we must all have undergo a double mastectomy at the age of thirty. The one woman in my family who did not do this is now terminally ill, and with this tragedy looming over our heads my future has became all the more precious to me. Not only do I feel the need to have and hopefully breastfeed my children before thirty-- before I loose the chance-- my cousins and sisters are all fast-forwarding their own relationships while the family is still alive and together. People are getting married, buying houses, and having children left right and centre, and though I've never, EVER pressured Michael into any of these things (and have both heartily agreed that these ARE all things we want some day) it breaks my heart that I am 25, have been with my boyfriend for 6 years, and we are no closer to having a family and life of our own than we were at 18. 


Of course I've spoken to Michael about this, and his response is that ideally he doesn't want kids until his musical career is over.  Likewise, the thought of a mortgage makes him want to gag and the idea of even holding down a job for more than five years is laughable. He isn't heartless about it, though. He understands my wants and frustrations, tells me he wants to same things, but whenever I try and breech the subject of careers and futures it's like talking to a brick wall. I think Michael might be depressed. He's told me he's paralyzed by fear about the future and doesn't know what to do, where to turn, or how to help himself. I've tried to help, been ignored, been shouted at and blamed, and at the same time my family are constantly on my back asking me when I'm going to realize that Michael *isn't* going to help me get where I want to go or achieve the life I want, and *why* I insist on being blindly loyal to someone who won't put even put his pipe dreams aside to build a life with me. Worst of all, recently, instead of biting back as I always do, their words have begun to sink in. I don't hate Michael. I don't blame him. I just feel so, so sad. 

What's going to happen to us?  What the hell do I do? I love this man so much, and he loves me too, to the ends of the earth-- but are my family right? All my instincts tell me to stick with Michael and toil together whatever happens. If we're poor, we're poor. If I have to be the breadwinner, I'll do it. If we can't afford much, I don't care, so long as it's me and him working as a team. But are we even a team any more? If we do this can I ever expect to be supported?

TLDR; I love my boyfriend more than anything, but he's chasing a dream and has many, many issues stopping him wanting/finding a stable job. I'm running out of time and willpower to help us.  I fear struggling through life and being unable to have a home/family of my own.

My friend and I have been going out for about a year, then I started to fall for her.  She said that she could not give me an answer right then and there, so I shrugged it off and thought that she just needed some time.  We still meet up for drinks after that, but around February, she then said that she got back with her ex.  I got upset and told her that I could not hang out with her like usual.  She said that we should still hang out as always, that I'm the only one she could talk to about movies and stuff, and that I'm one of her closest friend. I just told her that, that's not my role anymore. She has a boyfriend, and those stuff should taken up by him.  We did not talk for several months, until she texted me about a week ago.  She said that we should hang out.

The good people of /r/Relationships advised that I should just stay away and let her be, or if I do decide to meet up with her (which they are hesitant to suggest) I should man the fuck up and establish the boundaries of our relationship.  Unfortunately, I decided to meet up with her, but with your advice in mind.  After some light talk, she said that they broke it off since last March.  Apparently the guy is gay, and sleeps with other guys.  This caught me a bit off-guard.  I then asked how is it going to be with us, since she already knows that I like her.  She said that she only sees us as friends, and nothing more since I'm too sensitive. (Me, sensitive? I'm not the one who's been sleeping with a gay guy)  So I told her that I don't think I could be around her much since I still have feelings for her, and as reddit said, I'm just torturing myself when I'm with her. I guess I just lost another good friend there.

now back to reality, she has no real skills, has a kid from her ex-ex-bf who gets on my nerves constantly and shares no personality traits with me, she always talks about going back to finish school but we both know she'll never have the time or money to do it, and my family hates her because of her kid. they're a semi-religious type who definitely didn't see me in this situation, and constantly tell me to get out.

I know logically this isn't the right person for me, but I care about her and don't want to hurt her. I want her to be able to move on and find the right person for her and her kid.  but she will definitely fall apart if I break this news to her, and I'm not sure if she'll be able to put herself back together enough for her kid to have the parent he'll need.


another concern constantly nagging in my head is if I'll meet someone I like as much as her, maybe its worth getting over my dislike of raising someone else's kid who I don't get along with to have someone in my life. this is probably exacerbated by the fact that she's my first serious gf.

---
Backstory: my boyfriend Steve and I started dating in November of last year, and became “official” in January. So this will be our first Christmas as a couple. We've lived together since August, which has been awesome. Steve is in the process of getting his Ph.D and is a TA at the university where we both work. I work full-time, and I love my job. I make more than he does, but we split rent/bills/groceries as fairly as possible and do our best to live well within our means.

Steve’s family lives eight hours away, and he only gets to see them once or twice a year. For Christmas, the plan has always been that Steve and I will spend “real” Christmas with our families, but that we’ll do our own little Christmas with our own mini tree and gifts before going our separate ways for the holiday.

It might also be relevant that my birthday is next week. Per Steve’s request, I had sent him a list of gift suggestions, including a lot of things like “flowers” and “a homemade birthday cake” (he loves to cook/bake) and “a mix CD” and other cheap/free stuff. He’s also a photographer, and I suggested he frame one of his prints as my gift. We set a limit of $30 for each others’ Christmas gifts, which was his suggestion. We live within walking distance of like a million cool thrift shops so this is pretty doable.

Yesterday, we had what I thought was a really nice day. We went Christmas shopping, where Steve found a bunch of stuff for his family and for his two closest friends, which he was excited about. Then we went to the grocery store. It was Steve’s turn to get the groceries and they cost more than we usually spend (we hadn’t been shopping in awhile), so I offered to pay half or a part. He refused. I asked if he was okay with money for the month, since he’d just bought a lot of Christmas stuff, and he said he was fine.

We got home, and I had started feeling a little sick, so I went to lie down while Steve made dinner. After dinner we watched a movie, and then I started getting ready for bed as I had to get up for work in the morning and I still wasn’t feeling that well. When I came out of the bathroom, Steve was already in bed reading and seemed like he wasn’t in the best mood, so I got in next to him and started reading as well. After a few minutes we had this conversation

Steve: Can we not do Christmas together?

Me: What?

Steve: Do I have to get you a gift?

Me: Um...I guess not...but I already got your gift. (I had told him when I bought it. It was $15 so I was planning to get another something small.)

Steve: Well you can just return it. I don’t feel like doing Christmas.

Me: Why not?

Steve: I just don’t feel like spending the money.

Me: Are you worried about money?

Steve: No, I’m fine.

Me: Are you upset with me?

Steve: No, I just don’t feel like spending the money. I don’t like giving gifts.

Me: Well, I guess you don’t have to give me a gift, but I’d still like to give you yours.

Steve: Whatever, it’s fine, I’ll get you a gift.

Me: You don't have to if it's a problem.

Steve (obviously annoyed): No, I said it's fine.

Okay, I’ve done that stupid love languages test and gift-giving is one of the things that’s significant to me. I’ve told Steve this as well. Some of our past arguments have been about how I’d like him to do more “little things,” i.e., putting a love note in my work bag, bringing home flowers every so often, occasionally picking up little trinkets or things that make him think of me during the day. He always promises to do more of this, but it never happens. I love giving gifts, but I know not everyone feels the same way--I’d just like him to make more of an effort.

So I was thinking about this, and about how he was so excited about finding gifts for his friends and family earlier in the day. He’d also previously been bragging/teasing that he knew exactly what he was getting me for my birthday and I was going to love it so much and so on. So this whole conversation kind of felt like he was saying that he was excited about finding Christmas gifts for everyone else but he didn’t feel like spending any more money and I was the easiest one to cross off the list. Which makes some sense, since I do have a December birthday, but it hurt a lot, obviously, coming out of nowhere, and read to me like Hey scroogesgirlfriend, you are the *least* important person in my life. I was getting pretty upset on top of feeling sick, so I didn’t say anything else.

At this point, Steve got out of bed and muttered that he was going to go read in the living room.

He came back a few minutes later, complaining about how his day had been so unproductive and he hadn’t done anything. I pointed out that he’d graded a bunch of student papers and gotten most of his Christmas shopping done, plus grocery shopping for the next couple of weeks (I’m going to my parents’ for a few days around Christmas but I’ll be at our place most of the time, so we did need to get food), and he just rolled his eyes. Everything I said got shot down, so I finally just told him I didn’t want to talk about it anymore since he was obviously in a bad mood. Then he went out to the living room again and was out there until after I fell asleep.

This morning, he woke up right as I was leaving for work and tried to give me a hug. I kind of gave him a side hug. He asked if I was mad at him and I said “You were pretty unpleasant to me last night. We can talk about it when I get home.” He looked surprised, said “Okay” and I left. I haven't heard from him at all today.

So my question is: am I selfish for wanting a Christmas gift on top of my birthday gift? I've tried to make it clear to him that I'm happy with something homemade or super cheap. I definitely don't want a diamond necklace or a designer bag or a new iPad. I just want something small to show that he's thinking about me and loving me on two significant days of the year. 

And how do I talk about this with him? It's obvious that he's stressed about money, but the way he’s expressing it is super hurtful. I want to make it clear that it's not about whether he buys me something—it's about whether he treats me as an option while I'm making him a priority. Any advice is appreciated.

---   
**tl;dr**:  boyfriend of ~1 year told me he “doesn’t feel like spending the money” to buy me a Christmas gift as well as a birthday gift, even though I’ve told him that something cheap or homemade is totally fine.

(Edited for formatting)

---
**Update:** He texted me and apologized.

Steve: I'm sorry I was an asshole last night. We can talk more later but I am sorry.

Me: It's ok. I was hurt when you said you didn't feel like getting me a gift. I felt like you didn't understand what I was asking for or what I have been asking for. I want to talk later.

Steve: Are you breaking up with me?

Me: No!

Steve: Ok. I was afraid you were.

Me: I'm sorry if I gave that impression.

Steve: Not your fault. I would deserve it.

Me: You were in a bad mood and said some unpleasant things. It's not like you called me names or threatened me or anything. I'm not super happy about it but we can talk when I get home.

Steve: I called the cats names this morning, though. Horrible names.

Me: Then the cats can break up with you. :)

I hadn't realized he'd been fretting about it all day (although I did know he has a tendency to fret). I'm feeling a bit better now that he's apologized, but I definitely still want to talk things through and express why I was upset.

---
**Final update:** We had a long talk when I got home (I do a volunteer thing on Monday nights, so I get home a bit late). It was a really good talk and brought up a lot of things that I had no idea were connected to this.

So to make a long story short, Steve spent Thanksgiving with my family. He hasn't gone home for Thanksgiving since he started his Ph. D program, so he was excited for a family Thanksgiving. As a young woman in a young couple, I was faced with all the usual nosy aunts asking about whether we've talked about marriage, kids, etc., and I'm sure he got his share from the cousins/in-laws. I had expected this and warned Steve about it beforehand, and we laughed about it together afterwards.

However, in the car on the way home, somehow we struck up a discussion about if we had kids that I thought was purely hypothetical but apparently made him pretty stressed. I have no idea if or when I might ever want kids, but Steve, who is also pretty ambivalent on the subject, took it as me basically asking him to choose yes or no on the baby question and to give me his decision *right then*.

I'd also randomly started a conversation yesterday (which I had forgotten) about how we might do holidays if we got married. Obviously all of the nosy pestering over Thanksgiving had gotten into me more than I'd thought, because even though we've talked about marriage before, we're definitely not engaged or planning on becoming engaged anytime soon. It was a pointless conversation. So that was another moment where Steve felt like he was being rushed into this let's be a family and have our own traditions! kind of narrative, even though for me all of this was just idle what if type stuff.

So all of this, plus the fact that he spent so much on Christmas gifts yesterday, came to a head last night and made him lash out. He told me he felt guilty as soon as he started the conversation, but just couldn't seem to stop himself, which is why he left the room.

I told him how hurtful his behavior and been, and he nodded the entire time and apologized. I expressed how it seemed to come out of nowhere, like we'd had this nice day and then suddenly he was just so angry at me, and he agreed and said it felt like it came out of nowhere for him, too. He said that he hasn't been managing his stress well (he's a runner, but it's been fricking cold here lately, and he doesn't have a gym membership at the moment), and apologized again. I also told him, again, that I didn't want him to spend a ton of money on me, but I'd appreciate something small to commemorate our first Christmas together. He agreed and told me he hadn't really had any intention of not getting me a gift—it was just a lashing-out thing.

Now we're snuggled on the couch listening to *Serial* like an old-timey couple with their radio stories.

So this was a really good, eye-opening conversation. We're usually pretty good at communication, but this was definitely a conversation that needed to happen. We've both cleared up some major things for the other. Thanks to everyone for your advice!

Hey, so I've been going out with this girl for over a year now, we've been friends for over 4 years almost 5. The relationship started a over a year ago and she was living interstate, we used to talk almost every day and/or call each other as well. After the honeymoon phase as they called it was over at around the 4th month things were still going great, we wouldn't text or call as often but we'd still skype etc.
We visited each other a fare few times when she was still living interstate, each time it was great, no issues or anything. One night when she stayed over we did a few things sexual wise with each other, but not as far as sex.

Everything was still going great.
The start of this year she moved permanently to the same state as me so I was hoping we'd get to see each other a lot more. The day after she moved she came to my place and had dinner with the family, everything was peaches and cream.
The next week was Valentine's Day, took her on a date and it was wonderous.

Didn't talk to her much that following week, I would send her texts or facebook messages with little reply in return. Though on that weekend she sent me a few cute messages so I passed that week of not much contact as nothing.
After that the next two weeks I got minimal contact as she was starting uni so I passed that off as that. But it would really bug me when she had no time to message me back but still like and comment on all of her friends (her friends all live in this state too), the general way she would write those compared to me was quite different. Her messages to me were short, one word, contained no emoticons or exclamation marks. Then her posts to friends would be the complete opposite.

I saw her three weeks ago and it was all ok once again, she's flirty everything cute etc. but then once again after that day very very minimal contact, as well as viewing texts or messages and just not replying all together when they're things she'd usually jump at and be all excited. Just seems she has this new attitude towards me when I'm not near her. 

Texting her this morning about hanging out this weekend and got turned down, but it was for a good reason, she has a uni assignment due that day. But it's the overall way she's talking to me or lack of talking at all that's getting me worried.

I keep telling myself its because she's doing uni and its just the fact she's getting used to being in a different state, but then I'll see her comment on something with such enthusiasm that it gets to me. I haven't given her any hints that I'm feeling this way because the last thing I want is to cause issues, when we're together it's amazing and things just feel so normal, natural and comfortable. But when we aren't its when I feel things aren't right.
It could possibly be the fact I have a lot more spare time as my course at uni doesnt have as many hours as hers does. But the whole thing is getting to me. Sorry if i've repeated anything too. 

update: she replied to my text about hanging out, I then said let me know when you're not busy and we'll do something she replied with will do babe :) &lt;3 which is the first time in weeks she's messaged me like that. The more I look at this the I view it as me worrying over nothing :/

However, whenever he flirts with my sister (as a joke) or talks about girls he finds hot, it makes me really sad and uncomfortable. I've told him this **multipule** times. Recently, he went away for a campout, and instead of goodbye to me, he told my sister he'd miss her. I know it was a joke, because his sense of humor is more to amuse himself than others; but it still made me feel bad, and angry. 

Another instance was when we watched the movie To-Do List, just because it has a scene with Aubury Plaza masterbating, a female celebrity he admires.

**edit** explaination: He's told me he'd never want to do anything to disrespect me. But he takes his flirts/jokes really lightly, yet gets offended when I tell him that I don't want him to joke about something, as though I'm trying to restrain him from being himself.

He wants to feel comfortable saying whatever he wants to say, and while I'm on board with that.... it just seems like he doesn't understand what its like to feel disrespected like that.

Best friend - Dave

Best friend's gf - Claire

I have known Dave for about 10 years and for nearly all of those 10 years he has been probably the only person who I felt like I could speak to about anything and everything and confide whatever I wanted in. I know he thinks similarly about me given that he has told me things that he really shouldn't have told anyone. 

He secured a good job(for an unskilled student) at about 19. 2 years later he used savings and a loan from his grandparents to get a very good mortgage on an nice house at a good price. With help from myself, his dad, my dad and his grandfather he renovated it and added a loft conversion. He could rent out the other two rooms, live in the attic and the rent would pay the mortgage payments and then some. 

Before he got that job he had previously gotten another good job at the age of 17 which about 8 months later he lost for being an idiot and decided to carry on this streak of stupidity by taking up a new career of growing weed. Long story short he ended up having $10,000 worth of weed stolen from him by some junkies after a year of living like a complete no-hoper, missing a year of university that he had to lie to get a repeat of. He ended up having to move back in with his parents until he found the good job at age 19.

My point of telling you these two stories is to tell you that my friend has very positive qualities and very negative ones, he can be very enterprising, intelligent and forward thinking or can be completely stupid and self-destructive. 

Claire enters originally as a tenant of my friends new house. She goes to some weird dancing/acting/singing school and apparently hates everyone there. At this point I don't really see him much, talk to him every now and again but I am really busy and most of the time I spend socialising are with my girlfriend and her friends. This was about a year and a half ago and lasted for about a year of us not spending as much time as we would like with each other. 

Since about 6 months ago though I have had a lot more time to offer him, I broke up with my girlfriend, moved back in with my parents(walking distance from his house(2 minute drive) and started a business which was initially a part time income earner on the side but is now full time.  

Dave had recently quit his job(i am actually not too sure if he quit or he was fired) and came up with his own business, this was about 8 months ago that I first noticed that his Facebook status said 'CEO and founder of X', which to this day has no customers, no revenue - more on that soon.

Claire doesn't do anything any more, she quit the dancing school and now wants to go back to a real school to become a nurse, but colleges won't take anyone on for another 8 months and she doesn't have a job and I don't think has ever had one. She and him generally just sit in their converted attic watching TV shows, procrastinating on facebook, smoking weed or fucking. Somehow, some way, with two people not working and spending all day in that room, the room is still impossible to walk through with all kinds of garbage and unwashed clothes lying everywhere.

This is mainly why I can't stand her, she is a complete bum and that effects her attitude. For example whenever I go round to talk to him, it is never just him, it is always her, whenever he comes round or we both go out, she always has to come with him, why? because she has nothing else to do. Why is that a bad thing? well because she doesn't really do anything or know what she wants to do so all she does is talk about obnoxious stupid things - most often and particularly, bitching about, and in my mind quite perniciously, about people who were/are close friends of his and often mutual friends. 

The most teeth gritting example of this was on a Sunday I spent about 2 months ago at his place, from the afternoon till the evening. On the previous Friday she had gone out to a club with an old ex of mine. I had actually been with her for 3 years, 2 in high-school and 1 year after, she was my first serious relationship and though she had flaws I certainly still had a lot more nice things to say about her than bad. She had recently come back from abroad and was still a very close friend of Dave, I only spoke to her occasionally. 

My ex had been spending some time with Claire prior to the Friday night, but on that Friday my ex had supposedly said something which Claire claimed was encouraging her to cheat on Dave. She had said 'what happens in (the clubs name) stays in (the clubs name)'. Now to say that this was a 'wink, wink, fuck who you want he won't know' innuendo is to me spurious at best. I have since spoken to my ex about the allegation and she was like 'are you kidding me?', which was my thoughts exactly. She was obviously just trying to be humorous. However that Sunday I had to spend the whole day listening to this and a long litany of offences that were either half-truths or wilfully misinterpreted social slights all amped up and repeated to make my ex look like some evil manipulative slutty witch. Naturally my ex no longer visits or really even talks to Dave, every time her name is mentioned around Claire, even in my presence, it is immediately slandered by her. I would hate to imagine what she must say about her when they are in private.

My ex is only one of a few of what were once very close friends of Dave who now seemingly are too busy to spend time with him, coincidentally their names are also degraded by a swamping of cruel judgements whenever they are raised in Claire's presence.  The ratio of nasty things she has said about people I and Dave like relative to the nice things must be, honestly, 10-1. The only time I can get to talk with him one to one is either messaging him on Facebook or phoning but those conservations rarely last longer than 20 minutes because 'Claire wants to watch some TV show with me, will talk to you in a bit'.

Now to the real point that I want to get across, because my friends have had bad partners before and I have usually just weathered the storm until they see the light. Dave after what is at least 6 months is now actually starting his business, Monday he is going to try and find customers. Now the business itself is interesting and I am sure there is success to be had in the field in which he has chosen to adventure but his attitude to it is really pathetic. 6 months on, does he have a website, leaflets, logos, an office? nope, nope, nope, nope, he has registered the company, written some legal contracts(he actually plans to write some crucial ones himself today) and bought a raincoat. 

What I am about to write about happened last night and is why I am writing this. He asked that in the circumstance of his business going belly up if it would be al-right if he can join mine and we can work together. Ofc I immediately said 'yes that would be great'. We then talked about it, how I can take it out of my parents garage, let them use it again and run it from his house which would be far more convenient. Truth be told, we use to always talk about starting businesses together and how amazing it would be and I do still in many respects believe that, Dave is a talented guy with skills that he could bring to the business. BUT. The way he is living like a complete loser, failing to pay proper attention to his interests, not eating properly, sleeping during the day, smoking weed, and living with someone who does all those things and probably has done little else for all her adult life + a really bad personality is just something that I don't want to gamble my business and possibly my future on. I am also fairly confident that if he gets involved so will she by default.

What the hell do I do? I don't know how much he rates his relationship with me relative to hers and I am really terrible at telling friends blunt truths, I would hate to tell him what I really think about her and have it backfire on me, destroying one of my closest relationships. Should I just tell him straight and hope he adapts or just tell him that I am doing my business solo and keep both of them at arms length or just go into business with him regardless and hope it isn't turned to shit?

However, the past 6 months have been really rough.  He is an alcoholic and it is getting worse.  I'm a drinker too, but not what he is- blacking out every night, basing his life over drinking, etc.

He has also started drinking to the point where he blacks out, passes out, and then wakes up in a sort of sleep-walking way and does weird shit.  Specifically gross shit, like pee weird places and yell at me.  However he is really sorry in the morning.  Not sure why I put up with this.  Oh, and he won't get help.  He was sober for a month and it was actually more miserable then when he drinks.

I have tolerated this because 1.) I don't have a lot of friends, 2.) We split bills 50/50.  We need each other, financially.  The lease is in my name and I can't afford it on my own.  3.)  I love him and don't want to hurt him, despite how unhappy I am.  I tried to beak up with him once and omg, it was so painful.  He bawled like a baby for 6 hours.

Recently... I met someone else (40M), a friend of a friend.  I think about him all the time, though I doubt it's love- I probably just haven't felt happy about another person in a while!  

Anyway, I doubt this new person will be ~the one~ but, you know, I think the distraction from my relationship is telling.  

Oh, I made out (briefly) with this new guy.  I was surprised how not guilty I felt.  I felt guilty over my lack of guilt!  This is a terrible revelation because I don't want to be a cheater of course.

6429,Relationships,33pcl2,"I finally created a Reddit account simply to ask this question. I've attempted to research it for a long time now. I was diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar disorder (and OCD, technically) a couple of months ago and have been undergoing treatment. Finally having an understanding of my problems has brought me a lot of relief and peace, as I now have hope for improvement. Living with these undiagnosed for so long has been problematic to say the least. However, even with the knowledge of these conditions, I still do not know if what inexperience toward my partner is normal.

I spend several days believing that I love my girlfriend, and cannot wait to get married once we're out of college. I spend the next several days believing that I do not love her at all, and am merely afraid of leaving her/loneliness, etc. I have no idea during those items if I have ever felt true love or just silly highschool love. No matter how many times this occurs, I believe whatever state I am in to be accurate. The problem is, I genuinely do not know which to be true. Do I think I love her when I'm manic, or do I think I do not when I am depressed? I honesty don't know what to trust. 

I've tried reading about relationship problems with couples where one has my conditions, but no one seems to struggle from what I am describing. If anyone has ADHD and/or Bipolar Disorder or knows someone who does, I could really use some insight into if this is normal and how to deal with it. The stress of flipping every few days is immense, but I have no idea which one is the real me, so I cannot help it.

My now husband has been going on an annual end of season camping trip since before we got together. I started going with him after our first year of dating and have gone every year up until this one since we now have an infant. 

My problem is that this weekend involves drinking to excess and there are girls that camp in the area that have no boundaries (for lack of a better term). I have seen them climb into tents with my drunk guy friends that are in relationships. 

We have gotten in fights about these girls almost every year I am there. I have been 15 feet away from them and they have tried to drag him into their tent. My husband told me that one of the girls told him how she always had a thing for him and it was too bad he was taken (at the time I was again about 15 feet away). He told her she was dumb basically and told me about it as soon as we were alone together. He still talks to them when we go, which kind of bothers me because if the situation was reversed he would be completely pissed if I had any contact with guys that interacted with me this way. 

Early on in our relationship my husband went on this camping trip without me and made out with a girl there. He lied about it at the time but later told me the truth about it a few years into our relationship. He has never done anything since and has always been honest about anything I ask (that particular girl has never been back). 

For all of these reasons I think that a weekend of booze mixed with incessant come ons by drunk girls is just a bad idea. 

His side:
He has been going to this since before he met me. 
He is always honest with me. 
We are married and I should be able to trust him.
He is not going to do anything.
He rarely asks to do anything, doesn't go to the bar etc. so he should be allowed to go to this. 

Just curious what your perspectives are on this situation. I should point out that I am ok with him going camping to another place, or going for a golf weekend etc.

30458,Breakups,35irq0,"I began dating my ex in high school when I was 14 years old. There was teenage angst present at the beginning, but we worked through the childish things. We grew together and our relationship flourished when I joined her in college. We never moved in together due to her wanting to be married before we made such a large decision. Despite not living together, we were always staying over at each other's respective apartments.

Approximately 9 months ago, we began fighting regularly. It started off with practical disagreements and progressed into arguing about pointless things. Despite both of us attributing equally to the not-so-friendly banter, I had been taking a majority of the flack in hopes of repairing whatever I could. The past 3 months consisted of me stowing away any ill feelings I had so that I could talk my GF through her feelings instead. She grew upset over the smallest things (in my eyes) and it became a very exhaustive thing to try to fix. We are both musicians, full time students, and part-time workers. Outside of school, work, and down time with my GF, I required time to practice and time to study. These were things I couldn't do without making my GF upset. I tried reasoning with her about topics such as these and before I knew it, I was drastically depleting my practice and study time so that I could make her happy. We fought so much and tried everything we could to make the relationship work.

3 weekends ago we broke up on mutual terms. We spoke of all the stress we put each other through and I mentioned how much easier school and work could be for us if we just stopped subjecting ourselves to the fighting and stress accompanied with it. We also spoke of how we both have drastically changed. We are now functioning adults, nothing like we were 5 years ago when we first began dating. We are no longer on the same page as far as aspirations and beliefs go. There was nothing left that we could try to make our relationship work, so it seemed like a good move. 

The week following our break up was weird. I am not used to being single. I was not used to being away from my GF for longer than 8 hours. I felt much more free. I missed having someone to talk to about nonsense. One night during this week, I met up with my psychology group to work on a group essay. Only one of my group members showed up. My group member [24 F] is an International student and also very smart. By the end of the session, I felt like asking her [24 F] to go for a drive. So we did. We began doing this more often and we became close friends by the end of the week. The next week (one week ago), I decided I developed feelings for the International Girl (I will call her this for privacy's sake). We spoke about my feelings and I found out she also has feelings for me. She knows I just got out of a 5 year relationship and she is fine with taking things slow. 

It didn't take long for my EX to catch on. One afternoon, my EX confronted me about it and feared that we broke up because of the International Girl. She began by calling me an a**hole who never looks in the f***ing mirror.  I assured my EX we didn't, her and I broke up because of our own flaws with the relationship. She thinks I'm not taking enough time to mourn our relationship. I am not the type to want to spend a huge chunk of my time wasting away, I like to move on from strife quickly. We spoke of this for some time and eventually ended the discussion on a decent note. Later that evening, my EX's older sister sent me a rude text message. She basically said she can't believe what I did and I will never find a girl like her sister again (no, she's not in high school). I felt like the whole thing was rather elementary and I called my EX about it. She was embarrassed and told me her sister only knew we broke up, not Why we broke up. Life goes on.

Today I am feeling a bit torn. The decision to break up was not easy at all. I fought with myself many times over the thought of it before I actually went through with it. I have no intentions of getting back with my EX. I helped the International Girl pack up her dorm room yesterday morning and said goodbye to her. She left to catch a flight back to her Motherland and will be back in 3 months. We spoke of the distance and time apart and we are confident it will be a good thing for us. It will give both of us time to decide if the feelings are true and we will make the next step in our relationship when she comes back to the states. I have no immediate family or close friends near me, so I will be alone for a majority of this summer. I live in a small town. With college comes colleagues, so I am experiencing being the hot topic for now. All of my colleagues know of the break up and I guess my feelings for the International Girl are pretty obvious. I'm normally not the type of person to care much for what people have to say about me, but this is a situation I've never experienced. I feel happy and I feel I am moving in a great direction; however, it angers me that my colleagues feel as if they know how my relationship ended and how I should be coping. 

TL;DR; I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years, decided to make a new friend. I developed feelings quickly for new friend and now everyone sees me as some cad who is moving on too quickly.

Everything's been great. We understood and cared a lot about each other, and we never quarreled over anything. We just spent a vacation together last month and we were so overwhelmed with affection.

However there was an issue throughout the relationship that I find that she doesn't make too much time for me. We usually meet for an afternoon on Sunday after church, and just get a dinner 1-2 weeks. It was still a small issue (I thought), but for the first time I wanted to talk over something with her. Then she suddenly said she might not be ready for a relationship. She felt I love her too much and she felt being pushed. I was shocked and kind of wanted to talk it out, but we kept it short. We went no contact for a week.

I saw her posting a gift I gave her on fb, which she usually hardly updates. Then I texted her, and we have been texting for two weeks for now. We joke a lot with each other, always talk about the memories we shared, talk on bed every night with a good night. Very casual as if that night didn't happen, but we don't chat with the babe or dear or kisses anymore. Tried to date her a week after, she said she doesn't want to meet up for now.

Been two weeks since we resumed contact, but don't seem to be going anywhere. I felt her signals tell me she still needs me and cares about me, and I've been through break ups, usually it involves a lot of pushing and blaming, then goes separate ways immediately after. It's weird to remain close contact immediately.

Don't understand what to do now. Things are static now and we both seem to be comfortable with this state, but on my side, I am getting worse because she doesn't give me a definite answer.

Not sure if it is the right thing to do to try to move on and go no contact with her. But we have been next to each other since 3 years, and probably the only one that really knows every aspect of life about each other. Do not want to lose her forever, in whatever state.

I am a Middle Eastern Muslim and she is a White Christian. The first time I met her parents were at her graduation party and they were very kind and welcoming to me. They didn't know I was her boyfriend at the time. Fast forward a few months to September 2010 when she tells them that she is dating a Muslim. They freak out and she told me some of the hurtful things they said like calling me a terrorist and that I would take her back to the homeland and that they would never see her again, and they tell her to stop dating me. Of course we didn't,  and we just kind of did this whole out of sight out of mind thing with her parents until about March of 2011 when she called me bawling saying that her parents kicked her out of the house because they were fed up with her dating me and how they wanted her to date a good Christian guy. She came to my house and my parents allowed her to stay at our house a few days until things settled down. They ended up calling her and saying that she had to break up with me if she wanted to come back home, so she agreed to this just for them to let it go but we still continued dating on the super down low. Things were fine from there until about May 2012. We were madly in love at this point and I ended buying her a promise ring.  I still don't know if it was my smartest move, but she loved it. About 2 weeks later,  her parents randomly found her wearing a ring on her right ring finger. They threw her up against the wall and held her by her hair and started interrogating her. She spilled,  and they took her ring that I paid for away and hid it. She called me after all this and said that her parents found out about us again and that they were making her apply to colleges out of state to get her away from me and they told her that what we had was fake and that we didn't love each other. They went even as far as sending her to a therapist to help her get over me,  and her mom told her that the devil was making her date me. They sent her away in August to Boston and I didn't see her for 2 whole semesters but we kept up a long distance relationship. She came back in May 2013. We have still been dating unbeknownst to her parents. However we have been seriously talking about getting married soon and I have asked her what we were going to do as far as breaking the news to her parents that we were still together.  She wants them at the wedding,  but she knows that they are ignorant and would not change their ways, and would end up banishing her from the family.  Despite this,  she still plans on marrying me but has also acknowledged that she would be willing to give up her parents when she is ready to marry me. Of course,  I would feel totally guilty for the rest of my life if this were to happen.  I love her to death and despite our differences I would love to have her parents there at the wedding but I just know that would never happen. How do we proceed from here? Is it fair to my girlfriend if we tell them and have the wedding with or without them? Do I end things with my girlfriend so that she doesn't lose her family? Thank you

We didn't have enough space so I moved out.

I let them use my room while I borrowed her car...was gone half hour. I came back and he's standing over her (Shes curled into the fetal, sobbing loudly) threatening to beat the living daylights out of her. I step in, and somehow managed to get him to start balling by hugging him. 

From what I understand he's regressing towards a more childlike state whenever he's in trouble. He's caught several charges (None of them being violent crimes or drugs) and I'm worried that he's going to do something to someone he loves.

3802,Non-Romantic,2ydzw8,"My best friend and I have been close for about 6 years now and have always been there for each other. We've had our ups and downs, like anyone else. The biggest issue we ever faced was when I left Christianity and became an agnostic atheist, especially because I was sort of a spiritual mentor to her at certain points in high school. This has changed the dynamic of our relationship, but we've gotten through it.


Both of us have control issues that have manifested in different ways. We used to self-injure, although I stopped that habit a few years ago. 


About two months ago, she told me that she has been binging and purging on a daily basis since October of last year. I work in the mental health field, so I immediately knew that she was referring to bulimia. She was in an abusive relationship for several years and I think that a lot of this has to do with that, even though the relationship ended a year and a half ago and she doesn't have contact with him. She's also currently chasing after a guy who is leading her on, and that in itself is difficult to watch. 


Over the last few months, we've talked about this a good number of times. She has cut back to only having a episode once or twice every two weeks. This is still troubling, but we both take it as progress. I found her some resources online that are faith based because she refuses to go to counseling. She went to counseling for a brief period after the break up, but she said that she didn't like feeling like she was dwelling on the many, many issues that came from that relationship. I think that she has a lot to work through and that its extremely difficult to work through some of this stuff, so she's ignoring it and its coming out in her bulimia.


She has one older brother (22) who I'm friends with. She told me that she talked to him about it, so he and I have had a few talks about what to do. We didn't really come to any conclusions. It appears that she's stopped telling him when she has an episode though, because I spoke with him recently and he said that she's been doing fine (she hasn't). 


I feel like I can't talk to anyone else about this, except my own counselor. I'm worried about her and the ridiculous part is that a big part of my job is telling people that we have to wait for someone to hit a bottom before they want to change. And that the change is completely up to them. It's so much easier at work than it is to actually deal with this in my personal life.


So I know I can't make her do anything and that pushing is only going to make it worse. I am mostly looking for support and any other non-confrontational routes to approach this. Maybe some more information about eating disorders, although I am pretty well versed in this in my career field. I guess you never feel fully prepared to deal with this sort of stuff in your personal life. She means a lot to me, and even though we live in different cities, we've managed to stay close throughout all these years.

My boyfriend had a ring picked out for a while. I absolutely loved it. It was perfect for me and wasn't too expensive. We're not planning to get married anytime soon since neither of us have graduated and we want to be financially stable. But then his crazy, power-hungry dad and step mom found out he had bought a ring and guilted him into returning it and getting a ring from his grandmother. 


At first, this did not bother me. But there are a few circumstances that make me very upset.


1. I hate the ring. It's not my taste at all and I feel if I'm going to wear something for the rest of my life, I should at least like it.


2. His grandmother holds no emotional value towards this ring and neither does anyone else in the family. It was from her second or third marriage and she got married at least once after that. When my So went to get the ring he has a few to choose from. It feels weird taking a ring for a divorce. 


3. I think this is another way his parents are trying to control him. Since he was about 10, his dad and stepmother think of crazy ways to control him. (Example: when we were in high school, they threatened to throw all his stuff away if he didn't do little things like make it home for breakfast after staying at his mom's.)


I told him right off the bat I wasn't happy about the situation. He said he will buy me another ring and the ring he got from his grandmother will be my promise ring. But I don't feel comfortable keeping it as it cost twice as much as my first ring. He just doesn't want his family (mainly his dad and step mom), to know that I don't want the ring.

Boyfriend and I have been together almost 2 years. He moved into my house a year ago in February. The following month, he and I went to the bank together to open a joint account to pay the household bills from. I had a roommate who paid rent prior to him moving in, but I had her move out a few months before he moved in. Here's the thing- he has put money in that account twice in the year he has lived with me. He helps buy groceries, he pays for our family gym membership ($44/monthly) and he does buy pet supplies for the pets we've acquired together. 

I know, I know- have I told him that this bothered me? I wanted him to move in because I wanted him to live with me, not because I wanted his support. However, I do feel that he could be a little proactive in contributing to the household. We HAVE talked about his share of the bills and how he makes the same amount of money that I do. He overpays his child support by quite a bit. It's very important to me that he PAYS his child support, but I feel that the extra money isn't supporting his son. I've suggested that he pay the amount he is supposed to, and then he can pay for activities for his son directly (the boy isn't in any sports or activities as of now). I know I shouldn't, but I have a really hard time seeing all of that extra money go to his ex-wife when he isn't supporting himself. 

Boyfriend also drinks/smokes cigars/dips. He drinks nightly- either a 6-pack of tall beers or 2 25 ounce cans or a four loko. I don't know why he does it nightly other than my guess is its a habit or ritual for him? At this point, I'm feeling really butthurt about the amount of money hes pouring down his throat and the quality of time we spend together in the evenings. If he only drank every other day, he'd have enough money in a month to put a stupid little ring on my finger. 

He never initiates sex. Sex is mindblowing with him. I cannot get enough. He knows this. I never feel wanted by him or feel passion or that he has to have me. That's a pretty bummer way to feel for a pretty cute 26 year old girl. I've got a lot to offer and I'm all over him often and I wish I could have that feeling reciprocated. 

I am at a point where I have to figure out if I can accept these things, because goodness knows you cant/shouldn't change a person. However, he knows how important getting married is to me. He says, lets get married! but then nothing changes and plans arent being made. I feel like life is stagnant and I'm nervous about time passing while nothing is changing. I'm working myself on paying off debt, fixing up my home, and I'm working full time while still in school full time. 

There's TONS of great things about him. My daughter is so crazy attached to him and hes so great with her. He cooks for us. I love his company. He makes me laugh. He smells soo good. I'm just hanging onto threads here and don't know what to do.

19003,Infidelity,2td3u6,"I'm at a loss. I have had two serious relationships in my life and they've both been porn addicts. It's really hurting my self esteem and view of men/society at large.


The first guy was my first love, took my virginity, the whole shebang. We were together about two years. I was always okay with porn but i started to notice it was excessive and he kept asking me to do weirder and weirder stuff. He was the one who decided it was a problem and tried r/nofap  to no avail. It really started to hurt my confidence. Also, he looked at live cam porn and I decided that crossed a line for me. For that and many other reasons we broke things off. 


Move on to guy number two. Super vanilla, much lower sex drive, but it as kind of a breath of fresh air. He was so sweet and kind it all seemed fitting that he was so timid. Sex was good and frequent when we started dating. I establish that I don't care if he watches porn, but I don't want to hear about it and I don't want him to watch live cams, because that feels like cheating to me. Well, after 6 months we are madly in love, move in together and the sex plummets. It's infrequent and doesn't feel passionate. He tells me thats just how it is when you've been together for a while, and I know that's kind of true, but I keep getting turned down and we had to have a couple conversations about it. Everything else is going great. 

Then about a month ago i find live cam porn on his computer. I lose my shit, tell him it feels like he cheated on me, especially since I'd established that line. He apologizes and says it was only once or twice from a popup ad and he'll never do it again.

Here's where I kind of mess up - a couple weeks ago (a couple weeks after I found the cam porn) I go through some relapse things were I feel cheated on and worthless and unhappy. So I ask him to stop watching porn for a while - if he's horny he should save it for me cause I'm not getting any or feeling desired. He agrees. I tell him I will make him videos if he wants and I sent him nude pictures and sexts, but he never seems interested. 

So yesterday, I tell him I've been reading a lot of self-help articles (and reddit posts) and if he wants to watch porn that's not live cam or amateur that's fine. (amateur solo porn was still bothering me because I offered it to him multiple times and he didn't seem to want mine, so I'd feel bad if he was watching other girls). He tells me its such a relief because two weeks without porn is a long time. I ask him about cam porn and he looks me in the eyes and says I almost lost you once, you're the love of my life, you have to trust me I would never jeopardize us and I haven't and will not look at that again. 


WELP, GUESS WHO FOUND A BUNCH OF LIVE TEEN CAM PORN. Every day but one, while he said he wasn't looking, he was. All of it was amateur teen solo porn or live cams. One day there were 71 different links. He breaks down and tells me its an addiction (he knows the ex had one). I feel like its a scapegoat since he was caught in a lie, but I can't tell. 


I feel like absolute shit. I feel like I'm not good enough. I feel like all women are objects and men's sexual needs are put before our own. Why is it okay for men to look at other women all the time? Why is it the norm for a girl to give a blowjob and not expect anything, but the reverse is a rare find? Why are women encouraged to be sexy and provocative, but then demonized for being slutty. He said that he's attracted to girls in porn because it's different from me (ouch) and because it's hot. But that he'd never sleep with them because they're gross and have no self respect. THEY'RE DOING THAT FOR YOU. Especially for the teen shit they know that men are turned on by it and they get a lot of attention and it's encouraged, but then it will haunt them for the rest of their lives because if guys in their lives find out they will get jealous or think its gross. Not to mention if employers find out. Why encourage sexy behaviors and consume porn, but then condemn to women who make them? I mean of course I'd rather hear him say he doesn't imagine sleeping with them, and doesn't want to, but the alternative isn't settling either. 


**Tl;dr** - boyfriend claims to be a porn addict after being caught watching live cam porn which I had established as a form of cheating. Also, he has been lying to me about it for weeks (possibly much longer). Do I give him a second chance?

11499,Relationships,1uhydx,"I [19F] have been seeing my boyfriend [20M] for a little over a year now. Our relationship has developed very well and I can see us staying together for a very long time. I was in a relationship for 4 years before this one and I can honestly say that I love my current boyfriend in a way that I have never experienced. Really, he's everything that I ever could have asked for.

The problem lies in the fact that his mother is horrible. I mean, she's a generally nice person but she's a horrible mother. She's recently married this man who never wanted children. He's constantly being an asshole to my boyfriend and his two sisters [17 and 23]. He frequently expresses contempt for them and their liberal views. My boyfriend's not even liberal... To top it off, he's constantly reminding them that the house is his property, they're simply residing in it. I can understand it to an extent but he's set up cameras to monitor them and has even gone so far as to prevent them from decorating their rooms. He has a painting of a cat hanging over my boyfriend's bed. It's weird.

Anyway, my boyfriend's kind of stuck living at home now. He was at college for a year but ran out of funds (he's expected to pay his tuition completely) and had to move back in with his mother. He is expected to hold a full time job while he's at home and is not allowed to commute to school, even though it would save him so much money. The problem is, he's unable to save enough to move out and go back to school as she expects him to routinely feed both himself and his younger sister (they don't keep food in the house and she usually has dinner with her husband without them). Plus, she found him searching for apartments the other day and freaked out.

I guess this is coming off as being a bit ranty, I'm just trying to give an idea of how this woman is. Pretty much, my problem lies in the fact that she's pulling this whole throw my child into the pool and force him to swim act but she's not allowing him any freedom. She's become increasingly strict in everything that he does. He's not allowed to have anybody, including his older sister, visit. He's not allowed to go out unless he's working, essentially. She let's him go out to eat with me on occasion but he's absolutely not allowed back at my house. Really, she clearly doesn't take us seriously as a couple and is putting a real strain on our relationship. This was never a problem when he was attending school. He spent half his time with me over breaks, we went on trips, etc. 

The worst part is, whenever he tells her that he'd like to do something with me, she acts as if I'm a horrible girlfriend who is demanding all of his attention. She literally told him that he's been too nice to me and that any disappointment that I might feel is his fault for letting me get so comfortable.

Reddit, I'm going crazy. I can't stand the way that she and her husband treat her kids and I'm deeply hurt by her refusal to accept that I have a relationship with her son. I fantasize about storming into their house and telling her off. I just don't know what to do.

I suffer from depression and I depend on validation from others to feel good about myself- so whenever my boyfriend acts like he doesn't want to be affectionate with me or doesn't want to hang out with me, I tend to get depressed about it, thinking it has to do with a flaw of mine or being too needy.

I left the party early because I had to work early, but she stayed behind because a friend was in from out of town. We kissed goodnight and that was it. When I left, she hadn't even finished her first beer. She's not a big drinker. 

Two days later, I hadn't heard from her. I thought maybe she was having some alone time (she's very introverted, she and I text often but might go 3-4 days without seeing each other. It started to happen less and less, but it wouldn't be too uncommon. 

I got a text from a friend about her. It was information about her hooking up with someone at the party. I was absolutely shocked, horrified, etc. I was dumbfounded most of all. She's a very shy, reserved girl. Her wild moments include the time she spent $300 on books, test driving a car she wasn't going to buy, and one time she had 7 shots of espresso in like 2 hours. That's all I can think of. Really.

When I confronted her about it, she was shocked and she went non-verbal. She seemed extremely confused, hurt, etc. But the thing she didn't do was admit to anything, deny anything, or argue or anything. I broke up with her on the spot. She took it like a champ and exited from my life without another word.

I kept an eye on her because the whole mess seemed so out of character for her. Monitored some social media, her tumblr. She expressed some confusion and despair, but nothing attention-grabbing. I stopped after about a month, and we just disappeared from one another.

Fast forward to now. At a party, someone started talking about a guy who used to be a part of the social group, but was exiled. I didn't know why (I'm not too close, I am the throwaway friend) so I asked. It came up that a few months ago, he'd drugged a number of the girls at a party and slept with some of them at different times. One of the girls was the one who was visiting from out of town, and she spoke up about it loudly on social media. 

When I heard this, my blood ran cold. I asked them what party it was, and it was confirmed.

My ex was drugged.

In the back of my mind, I always knew something wasn't right with the whole story. You know how people say you never really know a person? That's a crock. I know her. I know her better than I know the socks in my drawer or the contents of my fridge after looking the 50th time. 

I was absolutely, undoubtedly in love with her. I don't know what I can do from here. Without the idea of infidelity or lack of trust, I would have NEVER broken it off with her.

When we would hang out, she would play with her hair a lot, we would just suddenly laugh at random things, we would talk to each a lot in very soft voices together (faces moving closer and closer - even when there are other people with us), wearing sometimes revealing/work clothes (blouse, tight skirt, etc; looks really nice in them btw), becomes really nervous and can't really string together whole sentences (I've never actually seen her do this until just recently), and some light touching to heavy hitting (played with my hair, touching my arm, playfully kicking my leg).

When I asked him why his class was listed as 1-3pm instead of 3-5pm he looked at me completely shocked and was really confused, he said he was going to speak to his school's registration office and a friend who is in his class about why his class showed up wrong on the time table. He said that when he checked his schedule in sept when school started, it was listed as 3-5pm and was weirded out about how it could change to 1-3pm. But to me, this makes no sense.

I confronted him and said that i feel like he lied, he asked me why would i lie about it and then print off my schedule to show you afterwards? i left it at that.

Normally, I like to give him the benefit of the doubt but it's hard this time around because:

1) two weeks ago he admitted to me that he lied repeatedly about sleeping with girls when he had only slept with one prior to me. he also repeated this stories to me more than once and elaborated on them, and made up a bunch of stuff about it. we have been dating for 9 months and he lied to me for about this same length of time

2) about a month ago, he was leaving my place and it was a monday and he said he had class from 3-5 and was going to meet up with his buddy at 5 after class. then he left his phone beside me and a text popped up that said can you be here for 3:30? he said it was his friend asking if he could meet up for 3:30, then he said to me oh shit, i have class at 3 and began to tell his friend to meet him around 5. i thought this was strange.

all in all, i feel like he lied to me about his class but i'm not sure what to think. i really need advice. he has lied before and that is what is tough.

**TLDR** bf has repeatedly told me that he has class at 3-5pm on mondays and has texted me during this time saying he's in class. i look at his schedule and find that he has no class listed for that time. not sure if i'm overreacting. he has lied before and is able to remember his lies.",I [f 20] think that my bf [m 21] may be lying and I need help,0.0,False,1.0,0.0,1386206726.0,/r/relationships/comments/1s4iej/i_f_20_think_that_my_bf_m_21_may_be_lying_and_i/,Romantic
26394,Infidelity,33wady,"I am 19 years old my boyfriend is 20. We have been dating for 3 years since I was 15. We live together in our roomates house. We are very close but lately I am beginning to have very strong feelings for my male friend (aged 19.) I try to be as faithful as possible so I rarely talk to my male friend but when I do all we talk about is how we want to be with each other. 

My boyfriend has cheated on me once and left me for 6 months to be with another girl from work but that didnt work out so we got back together. That was 2 years ago. I tried hard to forgive him but it is always in the back of my mind and I sometimes feel we are not meant to truly be together or that would have never happened. I made excuses for him that he was young and she was tempting but that does not make anything right. 

My male friend is extremely sweet and we have been like best friends since 7th grade. He always tells me how my boyfriend doesnt deserve me and how he would never hurt me. I would be his girlfriend in a heartbeat if I was single but I am scared to leave my boyfriend as we have been together and hes the only person Ive ever been with. 

I also am scared to sleep with my male friend because I have an embarrassing skin condition between my thighs on my leg. It is only acne but it looks pretty bad and I am scared he will be turned off. My current boyfriend doesnt mind it too much. But I am insecure about it. 

I know some of you are thinking if I loved my boyfriend I wouldnt be falling for my friend. I could agree with this, but I truly feel strongly about him. Its just that I have doubts since our break up and he cheated. A part of me wants to start fresh. Though I truly love my boyfriend.

What would you do if you were me? Thank you. I will choose best answer.

For example, he mails me handwritten letters when we're apart. Who does that these days??  He wants to have a future together, despite the iissues in our relationship. 


  
The problem is me. I am am extremely negative person. I have a supernatural ability to find something wrong with even the most perfect situations. And it has been really effecting our relationship. I am very good with finances, and instead of helping him with his problems (my original intent), I end up criticizing him and telling him how wrong he is with his decisions. He is more than capable of taking care of himself... so I don't know why I do this.  


  
I could go on and on with examples of me criticizing him for just about any thought or opinion or action of his. It's not healthy for either one of us, BUT I don't know how to stop. I want to be a healthy supportive girlfriend. I want to give back to him the love and support that he selflessly gives to me. Instead I show him hatefulness and toxic words... for no reason. I don't know why I say the things I sat and I don't know how to fix my toxicity in our relationship. I feel like there are times when I'm on the verge of being verbally abusive... but I don't want to be at all.
