23141,Dating,1q0a9p,"WARNING: INCOMING LONG POST

Apparently this girl I'm going to talk about was a rather active poster here. So hopefully I'm vague enough that she won't discover this post (then again she hasn't posted for six months), but not so vague that you guys won't be able to follow me.


**--MEETING HER--**

So I started talking to this (slightly older) girl on a dating site back in September. I remember not thinking much of her other than probably friendship material. She was snarky, fun, and we shared some common ground. The latter was really nice because the last person I was with... we had none of that (yeah not making that mistake of only going for super hot looks again). What's interesting about this girl was that she came  off as super confident person online, but apparently she isn't offline. Nevertheless, I liked the fact that she kind of already established base that she wanted to meet and do things with me.

Eventually she left the site(as did I) and we traded numbers at the end of the month. We started texting each other, and it was nice. I don't really have many people to text (or talk to for that matter) so it was mostly her. Again, her confidence was surprising because she directly stated that she thought I was cute, found my facial structure attractive, and complimented me on my body. Weirdest thing was her texting Sweet dreams, love on the first night I texted her. I thought she was one of those nickname using types, but she never use them with me again.

I did notice that one day she was very curt and short with her text messages like something was bothering her. It certainly will reemerge in the future...

**--SHENIGANS WITH MEETING SOMEONE ONLINE--**

So I went on my first date with her on 9/28. It was kind of an awkward first meeting.... I walked right past her not noticing who she was until she called me out. Truth of the matter was that when I initially saw her, I was like Wow, that girl's cute (even though I'm not a fan of her dredds) and continued on my way then realized Is she noticing me from my peripheral vision. Anyhow, there was an awkward silence as we stood in front of each other before we head inside. I thought about hugging or shaking her hand to greet her, but I felt embarrassed so told her to head inside.

During our dinner, I could sense that she was shy. That online confidence was certainly not there, but she gradually became more comfortable and relaxed throughout the night. I took care of the check because I told her she was the first person who I have ever met from the Internet. We talked after dinner for like 45 minutes outside before we left for the night. I remember her standing there awkwardly after we said our goodbyes until I told her to come over and we hugged. She was quick to suggest that we meet again at her place when I asked that maybe we'll do this again some time.

We continued texting each other until the next week. She was open with what she's up to for the most part. Still there was a day or two where she was very curt and short with messages, giving off this vibe like she's bothered by something.

**--IF YOU SERVE FROZEN PIZZA, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BAD TIME--**

10/6, I met her at her place. It was.... disappointing. She was unprepared. The place was a mess. She didn't exactly made anything other than frozen pizza. I also forgotten that she smokes (usually a deal killer for me) from the ash tray I saw in her room. To top it off, she fell asleep right next to me on her futon, while we were watching some cartoons. Oh and I ended up chasing her cat in front of her house when I left.

I almost didn't want to date her again after this. But when I think about it, I realized that the experience wasn't too bad. She was much more relaxed - much more talkative and was in touching distance when she fell asleep. In some ways, she kind of gave off a lonely cat lady vibe and I didn't want to see that happen to her. I decided a third date was needed to be more conclusive on where this will go with her.

I hand-wrote a letter to her before I left. Nothing big, just thanking her for dinner (even though it was subpar) and having me over. Surprisingly she kept it longer than I thought, asking me the next day if I was left-handed due to my handwriting.


**--FLIRTEXTING--**

So days past and we resumed our texting. We flirted a bit with each other sometimes. On a night where she had trouble sleeping, I teased her that maybe she needed a certain someone to lay right beside her and she went X3, that might help, lol. 

Her mind also apparently went to the gutter a bit more. For instance, when she said she preferred alternative methods of working out and then realized damned that sounded dirty, lol. Another time when she said she would teach me to drive stick, I mentioned if I had a stick, I certainly would let you show me how to use it. I didn't realize the innuendo until she pointed it out and she had some fun with it.


**--TELLING SOMEONE I CARE AND RUSTLED JIMMIES-**

At this point, I didn't really made any plans to meet her because I wanted her to take the initiative for once. Yet she never did, so midway in October I noticed that she was having one of those days where she seemed bothered. At this point, I told her that I care about her well-being and don't see her as just someone to fool around with (not in that way!). She replies with I'm not entirely certain how to respond to that :/.... WTF?

We resumed texting, but I was becoming aggravated with how she didn't seem to initiate plans for another meet despite her saying she wanted to see me again. I sent her a passive aggressive text and was blunt with her - I felt that the effort has been one sided and that it was hard to make plans with her sometimes because she didn't want to be bothered at times.

Guess she thought I was mad at her because she became a little bit more relaxed after I apologized. She resumed texting me a lot (just to note she's phone phobic). I started talking about how I've been seeing this one blonde. She immediately kept on asking who it was even though I thought she would realize I was talking about her. Once I told her that she was the only girl I'm interested in. She went *blush. I don't know what to say.

She's starting to have more days where she was bothered by something. But on other days, we were talking like the good old times. Things take quite a turn when 10/23 rolled along....


**--NOT SURE IF I SHOULD TRY DATING, BUT I REALLY LIKE YOU--**

One night I asked how she was doing and she responded with same as usual. She went on to elaborate without giving any details except that it's bad usually. I inquired why and she said just personal stuff. All of a sudden she told me she doesn't think she should be dating and don't think the two of us will work out on the long term, but she really likes me so it's weird. Moreover, she told me not to make her feel guilty for being honest and that she felt like an ass.

She told me she wanted to spend time with me once more and say stuff in person if she still felt that way. She divulged that she really likes knowing me and will be sad if I don't want her to. I question why I wouldn't want to see her, and she told me most people don't want to see her if she's not interested in dating. I replied I still want to and she was happy. 


**--SHE'S STILL FEELING THE COLD.... MOSTLY ON HER FEET--**

We made plans earlier on seeing each other on 10/27. On the night before the 27th, I asked how much better she felt compared to the last time we talked (in reference to her health because of a cold earlier in the week) and she told me, Different. I just don't want you to waste your time. I told her I was referring to her health and that I'm certainly not wasting time. She went Aww.

Sunday came around and she mentioned, I don't think today is good. Becoming aggravated, I told her I'm not going to ask why, but will instead say that I'm free every night for the rest of the week. She responded saying she will shoot me a message when she gets things settled. 

Didn't get any messages so four days later I texted that I hope she was doing okay and that she was within my thoughts. She told me she was so-so and thanked me. Also told me that the month has been rough on her and she appreciated me. Surprisingly, she responded well when I told her I would hug her right now if I could.


**--FROM HONESTY TO FRUSTRATION TO FRUSTRATED HONESTY--**

I made some chit-chat this past weeken. At the end of the night, I revealed to her that I felt like she has been trying to avoid me and have been more shy and reluctant lately. She replied telling me she wasn't avoiding me and said some of the things I say make her feel awkward.

I mentioned I felt like I'm possibly being played and whether or not she has been true to her words. She told me she will never be dishonest with me and wasn't playing around. Apparently she was trying to get to know me and figuring out how we interact together. However, she was uncertain about some things.

I told her I've been trying to figure things out as well and feel that a live meeting is best since things of this importance shouldn't be done over text. I once again stated that I can open up my schedule easily and it all depends on her, but professed that's where I feel uncertain.


**--EPILOGUE: SHERLOCK HOLMES MODE ENGAGED--**

The biggest question I'm pondering is what are these personal issues and things that need to be settled? I imagine that they're related to the days where she is bothered by something, but won't tell me. An ex she can't get over with? Another guy? Depression? 

I recall seeing a picture of her draping her arms around a guy that was in her bedroom. Perhaps she was in a long term relationship with this guy, but he died or she still loves this guy? I do wonder what caused her to sell off her car five years ago and then moved completely in September (selling a bunch of her stuff). The love for scotch plus smoking, trouble with sleeping, inability to be open, sleeping issues, feelings of loneliness despite seemingly having a lot of friends.

Her social anxiety... apparently she tries to close the elevator doors when she gets into an elevator as soon as possible to avoid being with people. She waits a couple of weeks to see a movie to avoid crowds. When she goes to social gatherings she tend to cilng real close to her friends. Apparently she does most of her clothes shopping online. She admitted to me that she's not good at handling arguments, often taking a more passive route. In her childhood, she felt like an outsider and was possibly bullied. Guys who make cat calls to her (on the site) made her comfortable along with sexual remarks. 

I wonder if this can all be related in some way.

But yeah, I'm not really sure what to make of this girl or if I should bother caring about her. She's one of the few girls who I become attracted to from personality first. If anything, caring about her seemed like the wrong way to go about it in the first place despite how she has grown on me. A shame though because I really do feel like this girl may has potential. Besides, she introduced me to Attack on Titan.

23142,Dating,2r9pf0,"TL;dr: I’m an honest idiot. Got hit on by a girl on OkCupid when I wasn’t ready for a relationship, realized she was wicked awesome and decided to give it a shot, but made that decision too late since she’s now in a relationship. Pursue or don’t pursue?

&amp;nbsp;

I’m still in college after taking some time off, and while at school I’m typically ridiculously busy. Because it’s a small New England school in the middle of nowhere, it can be difficult to meet people outside of weekend party settings (which can be awesome, but tend to produce, uh, short term results). Anyway, I keep active Tinder and OkCupid accounts for research haha

&amp;nbsp;

I broke up with my now ex a few weeks ago right before winter break. I’m home on break now. It was entirely due to circumstance and completely mutual. Turns out amicable breakups are uniquely awful. Go figure. I was still pretty down about the whole thing when a girl from a nearby college messaged me on OkCupid. She seemed intelligent and articulate with a crazy cool artistic streak. She was recently out of a difficult relationship herself and was interested in starting something new. I thought she was interesting, but I was honest with her about my situation and I let her know that I wasn’t interested in jumping right back into anything more serious than casual. Mistake #1, in retrospect, despite being completely true. She was disappointed, but understood and gave me her digits, telling me to text her anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

We continued talking as friends and I started crushing, hard. And stupid quickly. Turns out she’s an impossible combination of smart, crafty, and creatively talented. I guess I already knew that, objectively, but somehow just texting her and receiving recordings of her voice pushed me over the edge. I decided that I would pursue something more serious with this girl when I return to school in a few days. I made this decision by myself, inside my own dumb head, without telling her about it haha. Mistake #2.

&amp;nbsp;

During one of our friendly conversations yesterday, she casually mentioned that she was seeing someone. I was surprised, then crestfallen when I realized what had happened. I explained my new romantic intentions to her and she, of course, said that she had taken me at my word that I wasn’t ready for a relationship and had kept searching. Completely fair. I let her know that I had failed to communicate and apologized for that. She apologized too, but, I’m not really sure why haha. She told me that she was really really interested in me, but that now it was tricky because she’s really happy with this new guy, which is awesome, since apparently her ex was a douche-pickle.

&amp;nbsp;

So here’s the dilemma: do I take the high road and cut my losses, counting this as another tough lesson learned? Or, do I pursue this girl by asking her out for drinks once I return to school in a few days, at the risk of getting in the way of her good—though relatively fledgling—relationship?

23145,Breakups,1u217a,"So recently my girlfriend (now ex-girlfriend) completely fucked my life up.

Me and my girlfriend had been in a relationship for 2 years. One day she asks me to come round her flat to spend the day with her. Normally I'd love to spend time with her but we both had college on that day and so I politely told her we should go to college. She freaked out and I didn't hear from her for the next few days. We then start spending time together as usual but she seems different. One time when she had left her phone on the couch, she gets a dick picture from her 32 year old (married) stepbrother. I confront her and she tells me that she has been sexting with him for a few weeks and is planning to have sex with him soon despite him being on the other side of the country. I threaten to tell her dad because I was so upset. What does she do? She calls the police. I get put in prison overnight for rape allegations. I am a shy 17 year old nerdy kid, and suddenly I'm alone in a dark cell. Luckily she tells the police it never happened.

Straight away she's telling me she's sorry and that she wants to be with me. Infatuated me forgives her and we start to take things in our relationship very slowly, slower than we've ever taken things. She goes off to a music festival with her brother and I don't hear anything from her at all. Two weeks later and she's still stringing me along telling me that we're going to be together soon. I tell her I'm not able to take much more of this and for her to make her mind up on what she wants. She tells me to wait a couple more days and we can be together again properly, just like old times. We agree to go to the cinema to see a movie and I eagerly wait for her. She never shows up. I go round her flat and suddenly I'm thrown into a banister by her 6ft5 freak of a brother. He slams my face into the metal banister and strangles me until I lose consciousness. I wake up to my girlfriend smiling at me lying on the floor, covered in blood. He's standing over me and threatening to kill me. I just got out of there as fast as I could.

Since the age of 16, my ex-girlfriend had been scamming her own mother out of money. She even calls her bitch-face. Here's the main things she's done to deceive those close to her:

* She's told her mother that she lives in a house-share and that she needs £100 every week to pay for rent. Truth is, she lives in a council flat, the council covers her rent and they give her income support of £150 every other week to cover food. As far as I know, it's illegal to receive a regular income alongside government benefits.
* She told her mother that she NEEDED an Apple Macbook Air for a Computing course at school. She even went as far as to create fake emails and letters from the school requesting she has a Macbook laptop. Her mum takes out a large loan to cover the cost of this laptop.

* Multiple times a week she calls her mum or 86 year old nan and demands money because she has no food in the house. Truth is her cupboards are full of food, she just fancies a pizza.
* Recently she's told her mum that she's going to a university in Scotland and that she needs money to help her move there. Again, she's created fake emails and letters in order to help her deceive her mum. Her mum is planning to give her thousands of pounds very soon.
I've told the police my side of the story. I've told them how vindictive and dangerous this girl is. But of course it's two against one and there's nothing they can do about anything.

This girl has completely screwed up my life. Her recent actions have put me into a severe state of depression, my school work has been hugely impacted by my lack of concentration due to the incidents I've mentioned. I can't stop thinking about anything else, I've had to pay for a counsellor and she's just fucking her brother and living a happy and rich life.
I've written a letter addressed to her mother detailing how dangerous her daughter is and what she's done to her. I'm unsure of whether to send it. If someone could give me some advice, that would be great.

Haley (not her real name) began working 4 months ago. At the time she started I was already in a relationship and I didn't pay much attention to her except I noticed that she seemed to be flirting with me. She seemed very giggly and smiley at me and no one else. My relationship ended for unrelated reasons, and when I recovered from my break up, I decided to try and pursue her.

I started talking with her more in short bursts at work. We work in two different departments, but we're on the same floor so I occasionally pass by. I was contemplating on how I was going to ask her out, but I'm skeptical when it comes to people who flirt because in my experience it has lead to disappointment due to the flirter not owning up to it. I was waiting for some sort of green light or opportunity from her to ask her to lunch. One day that happened in a really peculiar way, I was working on something 40 feet behind her when suddenly she turns around (she had no reason to) locks eyes with me and just smiles. I did the same and we stayed that way for literally 90 seconds. Even after that I was skeptical, so I wanted one more. 

I went to go talk to her as usual on a monday morning and I asked her if she tried out this cool program I told her about in a previous conversation. She said Oh, I haven't played around with it yet, but I did show my friends it this weekend. I thought to myself, how interesting, she brought me or at least something related to me to her friends. I guess it was a very loose verification, but I decided to go for it. Later that day I sent her an email telling her if she'd want to do lunch. Her response was that She would love to, but I have to leave work early to go to class, ask me tomorrow I said sure no problem. Tomorrow came and I asked her again. She said that she's still up for it, but was concerned because she only has 30 minutes for lunch. I told her that's perfectly alright, and if she wanted we could even meet after work since we both live in the same neighborhood. She said that would be awesome, and that she'd get back to me. We exchanged numbers.

At this point given the reactions I've received, I was almost positive that she was interested. We were texting and at one point I lightheartedly straight up asked her if she was flirting with me. Her response: Actually, I'm really friendly to everyone. Sorry if I lead you on, I don't get involved with coworkers like that. I apologized if I made her uncomfortable to her and I promptly backed the fuck off. No texting, and whenever I'd pass her I wopuld just give her a wave and say hey and kept walking. I spoke with some female friends who admitted that if they were in such a position, they would have said the same thing regardless if they were or were not. Dually noted, I thought, but I carried on because I had no choice. Ball was in her court if she actually wanted anything.
 
Maybe a month passes by, and I'm not sure how it happened exactly, but we started speaking again. I kept my distance though. I noticed that in her down time, she would work on two papers at the same time. She was real busy with graduate school. One day she came in to my office with a technical problem. Her personal laptop crashed, her tablet wasn't cooperating with her, and she had an important virtual meeting to attend after work the next day. I told her to come in the next day with everything and that I would try my best. She did and I un-crashed her computer and got her set up for her conference later. I told her if she needed anything else to contact me. 

Later on that day she asked me which room she could use to have her privacy, I told her which one was free and she went up there. She called me though and was having some other technical problem. I went up to help her and realized that she didn't have a key to enter the room and was just sitting on a bench. She seemed stressed and at the same time understood that I didn't have to help her this much--as a result she wanted to bother me less and less. I laughed, told her to get up and follow me into the room. I get her all set up, and waited around to verify that everything was working. She thanked me profusely. At one point she literally blurted out I love you! which was a strange choice of words in my opinion. She asked me how she could repay me and I jokingly said I was going to say beer, but honestly, I'm more of a wine guy. We started talking about wine for a bit. She never really said anything that actually implied she would get me something or take me out.

Weeks pass. One day I had to do something on her computer and we were talking. She once again seemed quite stressed, although she seemed a bit teary this time. I asked her what's wrong. She said a relative of hers had passed away a few hours ago. I said I was sorry and asked if she needed a hug. She turns to me, puts her hand on my knee and says Thank you, that's sweet. I'm going to need much more than a hug though. (My head = wtf) We spoke for some more and as I got up we embraced. Over the next few days, I checked in on her. Asked her how she was doing and she would thank me for asking and give me a warm smile.

Another couple of weeks. Doubt set in. I decided to get my mind off her by approaching other women outside of work. I thought to myself, well hey, this all seems very one sided. I'm being a real sweet friend to her and she hasn't really done anything for me. Not that I'm entitled to anything, but I just think when someone is nice to you, you should at least acknowledge it. Last monday, she walked by my office and noticed that I was the only one there. She came in and said hey. It was unexpected, I said hey back and she said I always want to say hi to you, but there's always 10 other people in here. At that moment, another coworker came in and I told Haley that I had a funny story to tell her later. She said we'd speak later.

We get to talking and I tell her a couple of stories. She was laughing and receptive. I told her that I had another story if she wated to hear it, but it wasn't appropriate for work. I offered to call her that night. She said that'd be great, but it's her last month at grad school and so it's crunch time. I said that I'd try her later. I try calling and no answer. I figure oh well. I get a text the next morning from her apologizing and saying how she was up late finishing papers and said that she could talk at work or after. The same thing happens for the next three days and rather than get angry (which she got the ense that I was getting) I just told her, hey, I don't want to be another source of anxiety for you. I know you're busy and graduate school is rough, we can talk when it's over She was appreciative.

This Monday as my coworker walked over to Haley's side of the floor, he noticed that Haley saw him and then jumped up and walked over to my room (she was waiting for me to be alone) and we chatted again. She said she still wants to hear my story. Later that day I approach her and ask her if she's free later. She looked nervous and said how she was going out with her friends and asked me why. I said oh well I wanted to know if I should call you. I made a joke about how there is a lot of anticipation for this story and I don't know if it can live up to it. She laughjed and said no it's fine and that I should try her later.


So that's where I am now with no idea on how to think, or how to proceed. I'd like to ask her to hang out, but I just don't know what to believe.

23159,Breakups,2s5a9v,"This is a person I've had a tumultuous past with. He has traveled here, I have traveled over there, we tried for a more serious relationship once but it didn't work due to his fear of commitment. I was going to move to his city regardless of our romance fizzling, but I didn't due to a work opportunity presenting itself here at home. 

Two years had passed since we last saw each other. We kept it strictly platonic after some time and enjoyed our friendship. Both of us have had our relationships in between and he just broke up with his girlfriend. We kept in contact because we share a really great connection. We start talking more often and next thing I know, we're back in our old patterns of texting all the time, talking on the phone, skyping until odd hours of the night. We decide it's worth exploring again, no promises but it was obvious we were going to have sex again.

He pays to extend my trip (it was initially only 4 days, now it's 9). He waits for me until 3:30 in the morning until I arrive. We have an amazing, electric kiss as we hugged each other. No sex that night because I was on my period. No sex the days after that because he got extremely sick. When it finally happened, it was great.

I spent a few days/nights with my friends in this city, and then it's time to spend more time with him because my friends left. 

On day three, he tells me he needs time alone. I know that he's being nice about telling me to fuck off. I have made it a point to give him time alone. He worked on a few days and on one day he didn't, I went off with a few people he put me in contact with to help out with a photo shoot. I gave him time and space, I knew this was his way of dumping me. I was right. He couldn't do it anymore. We were both on the phone crying because he refused to even see me. He did tell me he was going through depression and wanted to shut everyone out for about a day and no one is letting him.  Finally, he admits he likes me more on the internet. 

This is a person who I shared a lot of private, deep, emotional thoughts with. This is a person who shared many of these feelings with me as well. We spend all day talking and texting each other. We were getting in the habit of skyping often. He consumed my daily life with his constant contact and now that I'm there...he decides it's too much? He welcomed me with open arms and leaves me pushing me away. I was left crying on a staircase, totally alone, in a city for two and a half days knowing I had absolutely no friends there. 

I have tried to get answers out of him because I feel like at the very least, he owes me an explanation. And nothing. I'm met with nothing. I feel so absolutely hurt and devastated by this. It has been about three years of intensity and friendship and I feel so stupid, used, hurt and humiliated. I cannot put into words how god awful this has made me feel and it is the worst feeling to have when you feel like the person hurting you is treating *you* as though you're the hurtful one. 

I would like some insight? Why would someone who devotes so much time and attention to a person do this? I stopped trying to reach out to him pretty immediately, when he was making it very clear he didn't want to deal with me anymore, but I am at a total loss for words.

He was my first real boyfriend and long therm realtionship. When we started the relationship it was awesome, we have so many shared interests and like to do the same things. He really cared about me and made me feel really special. We shared a lot of things together and we grew up together for this 3 years. We're pretty similar people, quite shy, we don't go out much and with low self steem n_n' Maybe like everybody I thought it was going to be forever, I know I'm really young but I was willing to go through whatever it may be to be together. We pictured sharing our lifes for a long time. 

A year ago we were both working so we decided to make a trip together, a work &amp; travel program. For this trip you have to be a college student and give proof that you're indeed studying. He wasn't really sure if he wanted to study but he started college. He only took 2 classes and fail both of them for various reasons. The problem was... he didn't tell me anything. He didn't tell me he missed some of the classes and that he failed. He hide it from me and I found out because I asked a friend that goes to the same institution. When I confronted him he said he was scared but that's all, he wasn't going to tell me anytime soon what happened, and what bothers me it's that he going to college was something important for a project we had TOGETHER, it could ruin the whole thing and make us loss a lot of money! He told me he was sorry, that he would never hide anything from me again. I was angry but I tried to let it go, anyway my trust was kinda broken. 

We went on pretty well but It wasn't the same as before. Little by little he stopped caring about me as much as before. We were still planing the trip together, he started to take college more seriously. Our intimacy decreased that whole year for different reasons. But I still loved him and wanted everything to go well, and I was really excited for our trip and living together for 4 months. 

So in december last year we arrived at the USA to work and live there for 4 months. We were going to live with another girl but she moved out so it was just the two of us living together for the first time. I was really happy living with him, I liked sharing my daily life and go to sleep with him everynight. But everyday he cared less about me. I had to ask him to write me letters or something that showed me he loved me, i was always the thinking what we could, where we should go out and i was always trying to make him happy. 

I wasn't very emotionaly happy overall. I stopped talking with my parents for a month there, and wasn't happy with my friends because it semmed i had dissappeared for them. But when I asked for support he tried to help but not to much, he even told me he wasn't going to try anymore. He regretted saying that but still didn't care as much as i wanted to. 

One month before ending this trip i found a conversation between he and his brother in wich he was saying that maybe he would have had a greater time if it wasn't for me. I asked him about it and he told me he didn't felt confortable being with me anymore. He told me he wanted to only care about himself and he didn't feel good living with someone. He didn't told me he was breaking up with me but... sorta. I spent the most horrible night there, apart from my friends and my family (wich i had recently started to talk again) I went to work the next day with tears in my eyes the whole shift and really felt horrible the whole time. And it really hurt that he said that because I was the one who made it possible for him to be there! I had to arrange to whole thing almost by myself and took care of everything because he was lazy. And he was hiding stuff from me again, instead of talking with me about what was going on his mind he hide everything. And I thought he was happy like me living together!

When he arrived home from work he told me with tears in his eyes that he didn't know why he said all of this things and that he couldn't live without me, that he regretted everything and was a mistake. So, I was angry, but relieved. I still wanted to make this work because, shit! I love him! That's what couples do, i don't know... 
We went on the rest of the trip, we even made a road trip together before coming back to our country. Things weren't perfect, but I tought the road trip was good. My trust was really broken and I told him that I needed to see that he really regretted what he said and really wanted to be with me. I didn't got to much answers what also made me angry and I reminded him how bad he made me fell and that he should really act in consecuence. I know now this wasn't really helpful but i wanted him to react, do something! 

We also discussed that he needed to something with his life. I'm not talking about just working or studying, I'm talking about something that moves him. He had lost interest for everything, family, career, me, himself. He told me I was right and aprecciated the fact that I wanted to help him with that and that he was never going to realise that he was doing that without me. 

But... we arrived at our country two weeks ago and he started to ignoring me a little, we met each other and I asked him if he had tought about everything we talk in the last weeks. He told me he wasn't sure of anything, we started fighting and he left and told me we weren't to see again until he made a decision. Two days after he came to my house and told me that it was better for both of us to break up. That his feelings for me are not the same as before, that I am everything he wants in a girlfriend and the best one he's ever gonna find but he doesnt' want to be with anybody. He told me he didn't wanted to make me more bad and that I deserved better and he couldn't give what I wanted. I... was kinda speechless. I saw it coming but wasn't totally ready for it. It sounded like it's been a long time since he doesn't love me anymore and I felt so delusional because I thought we weren't so bad and I did everything for him. And I feel he doesn't understand how much I loved him and how bad is this for me, and how wrong he made me feel before. 

So I tried to talk with him the following days, because he wants to stay friends but it's not working well. I get angry because he seems so calm like nothing happened and doesn't care about me. He says he does! But does nothing. I feel like he says a lot but then he doesn't do anything. 

I feel better than I thought because I realised that maybe it really was the best for both of us and because I'm not that stupid and since the thing that happened in the trip I knew everything wasn't right. I need someone that really cares for me and is there when i need it. Someone who can tell me what's going on in their minds and comunicate. Someone who has goals and does things, that has iniciative and interests. 

But it stills hurts, we shared important things and years together. I really loved him and did everything i could to make him happy and... i guess it wasn't enough? I thought it was going to be forever. (maybe because my parents started to dating when they were 15 and 20 and are still together and happy that i have this expectations)
I try to understand how he feels, he's a little lost with his life right now but I think he gave up so quickly. Maybe he needs to be more mature. And I also feels like he wants me to still give him everything but without the compromise of having to reciprocate, he even told me thinks of me like a sister. So yeah, he doesn't love me anymore for a long time now.

I want your opinions and encouragment to get through this. I try to see this as an opportunity to take care of myself and my own happiness but I still feel very hurt.

23164,Breakups,2sngza,"My girlfriend abruptly ended our relationship today.  I am devastated.  

From my perspective, things have been placidly good.  No obvious friction.  There has been a gradual loss of intimacy, but this was a 4+ year relationship and this seemed somewhat normal to me.  Looking back, I can see a bit more that her warmth had dissolved a bit -- sex seemed like a chore for her, and I could tell she wasn't passionate about me in the same way that I was about her.

I feel like I've been a good force in her life.  I try very hard to provide for her, be an ear and a shoulder, and keep her safe.  There's always been a big disparity in these things: I pay for most things, I do small and affectionate things -- she's usually pretty distant.  I'm okay with this, actually.  I always felt like what she needed most in life was someone to provide stability and support.  She has had a tumultuous life.  I just wanted her to be happy.   Maybe I fell short, I don't know.

We haven't had very many relationship talks leading up to this -- very minor, civil discussions.  Did she just drift away?  In our brief talk after she ended it, I think one of the major messages was that there's a lot out there for her.  I can't really imagine anyone else liking her to the degree that I do.  I'm sure most of this is artifacts of my anxious mind.  I don't think there's anyone else.  I was her first serious relationship and I think sometimes that she thinks minor disagreements are portents of something more major.  We've never really fought (shouting, anything physical, etc.) but she'll occasionally reference our fights.  

This is getting pretty incoherent, sorry, I'm not all there right now.

We both made a lot of sacrifices early in this relationship to make it work.  Lately we've talked a bit about possible divergence of futures (wanting to live different places, different life goals) but I like her enough that I was really willing to make these sacrifices again.

I feel rudderless, wounded, unsure of what to do.  I love her so much.  I don't know what to do with myself.  My friends are all telling me that there are so many girls in the world.  I only want one of them.  fuck

I'm just heartbroken.  I want(ed) to marry this girl and just get old together and hold hands forever.  I don't think I've ever felt such acute oblivion in my life.

TL;DR: My girlfriend ended things.  I am still in love with her.",My [29 M] girlfriend [23 F] ended a long relationship. I'm crushed.,0.0,False,2.0,12.0,1421432396.0,/r/relationships/comments/2sngza/my_29_m_girlfriend_23_f_ended_a_long_relationship/,Romantic
23169,Breakups,1h2fhz,"Four weeks ago, I broke up with my long term, live-in boyfriend, Jeff, [28M]. He's gone now, and I miss him terribly, and I still love him and he still loves me, but the break up was the right thing to do for both of us, especially me. He respects that, and wishes me the best, as I do him. Our relationship had generally soured and I was enabling some pretty destructive behavior and couldn't take it anymore.

While I understood that the relationship with Jeff wasn't good anymore, I didn't take action until I spent some time with a friend, David [46M]. Being around a person who was obviously interested in me, cared about my well-being, and was kind and positive and didn't have the same baggage that Jeff had was completely liberating and refreshing and gave me that final push to break up with Jeff.

So things ended with Jeff and I grew closer and closer with David, and in a very short period of time, too. It was easy to do - he was a willing listener and had all the experience and know-how to make me feel good about my decisions, and I was desperate for company and validation in my actions. Any dock in a storm, I guess. We're 22 years apart, which is, frankly, the largest age gap I've ever broached, but not by far - I have a habit of dating older men. It doesn’t feel like 22 years. 

Anyway, in my heart, I knew that I needed to take a break to recover from my previous relationship, and other recent changes in my life (new job, just moved apartments, just started therapy) but I ignored that. One thing after another and suddenly I love - or think I love – David. He's interesting, kind, stable, has productive hobbies and likes the same things I do. We laugh and talk for hours and hours and have similar life goals. Of course, he’s a little closer to achieving those goals. Also, I cannot accurately describe just how amazing the sex is. He says kind things and that he loves me. He reveals that he's had a crush on me since he met me. That he thinks I'm the girl for him. That he can say things to me that he's never been able to tell anyone else. That we're so good together and that he thinks we would be great together - forever.

Ho-lee-shit. That scares me. I don't even know half of who I am and he wants to marry me? He says he thought he'd be single forever until he met me. I know he's up to his elbows in [limerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence), but what he's saying takes a lot of risk and more than just a blind eye to the reality of the situation, right? Of course, I can’t help but compare him to my recent ex, who does know me, and does “get” me.

And now I want out. The longer it goes on, the more gifts and guilt get piled up, and the more I know that I can hurt him now, or I can hurt him later with this news. I know I shouldn't have let this happen in the first place, and that this is unfair to him. I know that I need to put my needs first, or else I’ll never recover and he will never be happy. I don’t think I even want to hold off on this relationship – I just want to stop it. 

And I don't know how to do this. He is a kind person, and needs someone better than me - I cannot give him any of the things he rightly deserves. I am afraid that he is so blinded by limerence that he can't see just how terrible my baggage is.

At first, I was so weary of breakups that I thought I could just go with this relationship and pretend for a while. Now I realize that’s a terrible, terrible idea and that I would just sabotage the relationship, anyway.

Is there any advice you can offer, r/relationships? Any guidance you can provide? I know what I have to do, but I don’t know how to let down a love-struck, genuinely kind person. I don’t even know how to let him know that we need to talk about it. When we talk, when we’re close, everything is good. It’s the second we’re apart that I have doubts about everything.

23174,Infidelity,397216,"Let's get it out of the way that I am also a bad guy for snooping through his phone. There have been a couple incidents in the past 6 months between us that have brought out the trust issues and the crazy girlfriend in me. 

This morning I snooped on his phone and found a selfie and a text that said Hey got your number online, are u available tomorrow night? sent to a random number. This text is from a week ago. I googled the number and it is 100% an escort in our area. There was no text back from the escort. Oh, and when I tried to look at his recent calls to see if they spoke over the phone, the ~25 most recent calls were from 5am the morning before and they were all to phone sex lines. After that, the call history had been deleted.

I am in complete and utter shock. We have sex on average once every 2 weeks because he says he's not that horny. He tells me all the time how ashamed he is that he doesn't have the sexual drive a man his age should have. I have a very high sex drive and would prefer sex every day if he were up for it. 

So yes I confronted him. He admitted to calling the phone sex lines and says he's called them a few times during the course of our relationship (a year of which was long distance- so that's understandable). He will not admit to texting the escort. How can he deny that? How can he deny a picture of himself and a text sent from his phone to an escort? He says he has no recollection of sending these texts at 2:30pm on a Wednesday, just before he left to go to work. What?

His excuse for the phone sex calls is that he does get horny, but very late at night. His work hours are 4pm-2am and my work hours are 8am - 5pm. We have no days off in common. He says he's often just not interested in having sex at the times when I am, and I'm sleeping when he wants it. 

I love him very much and I truly believe he loves me very much. Is there any way to get him to admit that he sent the texts? If he could at least start by just admitting that he sent them, we could start to work on getting past it. The thought of having to break up with him over this breaks my heart, but how can I live with myself if I stay with him? What do, reddit?

23184,Infidelity,1tw6ib,"So we've been together over 3 years since High school: she was my first time, my first real girlfriend, my first love. 

In September, out of nowhere she asked to take a break, to find herself. So, we broke up. I was devastated. But, about a week later, we met up and talked it out and she asked for me to take her back, saying that what she really wanted was me. I was really hurt, but I wasn't ready to give up on a relationship I had been a part of for 3 years. 

During the conversation that took part before we got back together, we discussed any sex we had had: she promised me she hadn't, and I hadn't because I hadn't gotten over her yet. 

So yesterday, she picks me up for a drive and tells me that not only did she sleep with someone during the break, but also slept with another person in August while we were still together. So, two people within the span of 3 weeks. I immediately broke up with her on the spot (trust is huge for me, and she knew that going into the relationship) but I left the door open for a conversation after the new year. 

I feel manipulated, angry, and hurt but I still love her. I'm not sure if I could get over the fact that she had sex with someone else, since the only connotation I have with it is one that is deeply intimate. I need a second opinion, so I'm looking for /r/relationships for help.

23186,Breakups,2q5a16,"In September while I was in Southwest Asia, I got told I would be moving to the Netherlands for the military. It caused a lot of friction with my girlfriend at the time. We had been together a year, living together the whole time besides my 5 months in the war.


Once I told her, she had some serious doubts about what she would do. I got home in November and things seemed to be going well. She still could not make up her mind however. Finally, on Thursday, she decided that the best thing for her would be to break up. I still have so many questions and things unanswered and things. Talking with her for example, she says she is just as miserable as I am. That she was forced to make two negative choices (be with me and leave everything behind, or leave me) and that she made the lesser of two evils. That she is as miserable as I am. I don't understand this at all. If she feels that way, how can she still think it is the right thing. It gives me some false hope that I will get a call asking me to come back, or that somehow our relationship will be restored


I fell deeply in love with this woman. We had discussed marriage, and now I can't see it with anyone else. It makes the pain even worse when I know she feels like I am this amazing person she wants to be with but because of my job she can't. So why can't we either be together or her just hate me and be done so I can be done too, because my love is strong to let go of if the other person still has it to...


To make it all even worse, I have a slim chance of not even moving anymore because of some medical issues and then if I don't leave I went through all this crap for nothing. I know this is thinking negatively, but I also see that this situation is highly likely to repeat itself in the future once I get through this current bout because looking at timelines, I know being in the Netherlands is only a 3 year guarantee so if I do get involved with someone there, I'll have to have the same pain again...and repeat that process for the station after the Netherlands over and over until I retire. I had something amazing and it is being stolen from me.


Some people have tried to say the bad things about my relationship to try and cheer me up, but the fact was I knew all these things. My love was strong enough that I knew the issues would either resolve and not be bad, or stay there forever and I was ok with both because as the end of the day, I was, am, and will be in love.

My girlfriend (19F) and I (20M) just had a very deep conversation tonight, basically about if I still loved her and wanted to be with her after a shaky couple of weeks. We have been together for nearly 10 months. We exchanged I love you's and ended on a good note agreeing to tough it out and I walked back home to my fraternity house. 


Fast forward to going to sleep around 3am. I became somewhat conscious and had a girl cuddled up close to me and for some reason I thought it was just my girlfriend drunk (even kinda looked similar in the dark) and we were kissing and making out a little. I then went up on my elbow to be able to kiss her more intensely and woke up a little more and realized that this was not my girlfriend. My stomach dropped and I questioned who she was and made her get out of my room. I can't reconcile how long it lasted because I was so groggy but I wouldn't say past 1-2 minutes. Hopefully. 


Now here I am, laying awake in bed. Once before, about a month ago, she slept over and a drunk girl layed down next to her in the middle of the night thinking it was my friend in the room over's bed and she left once questioned by my girlfriend. She said she didn't know what she would've done if it happened when she wasn't there, and now it has. 


I don't know what to do. We are supposed to drive to pittsburgh tomorrow afternoon and she has a test earlier in the day. I texted her shortly after it happened saying we need to talk and that I loved her. I don't know when to tell her and what to say tomorrow. I don't doubt that she will believe me, but I think it will haunt her thinking of me kissing another girl. It also happened in probably the worst possible time with everything going on between us. I just can't believe it.

23205,Breakups,2k984s,"Alright. So my my girlfriend and I dated for a year. On and off a few times. (17m) (17f). Currently we are both seniors.

Last June I didn't think the relationship was working anymore. We weren't communicating as well as we should and I just felt distant from her. I asked her to talk about it but she said she wouldn't talk on the phone and told me to pretty much just break up over text. I offered to talk to her the next day in school but she refused.

After a week or two some of my really close friends turned their back on me. One kid, who will go by the name of Ryan told me that he was going to try to get with her or hook up wit her. I said why. And he said he doesn't give a fuck. Then my other friend, let's call him Nick told me he has feelings for her and will try to go out with her.

I couldn't take going to school and I started doing some drugs that made me go nuts. She eventually hooked up with Ryan. She told me everything they did (though not sex).

After a couple months go by. We start talking again and give it another shot. She starts treating me like crap for example ignoring me for no reason, yelling at me in front of other people and overall telling me it was my fault.
So a couple weeks ago she calls me and tells me she can't take the fights we've been having. I say I don't understand. She's hysterically crying. So she breaks up with me. She starts talking to Ryan, though she isn't interested in him. I hear all these rumors about her sending nudes. Turned out to be not true. But she has depression problems and she told me she needs attention.

Last week after a bit of no contact. In the middle of class she's rubbing her hair on my neck being flirty and what not. She's showing me funny texts and trying to engage me in conversation, as I have my headphones in listening to music. Later that day I told her very nicely to leave me alone.
She hangs out with assholes. People that tend to gossip and overall aren't good people in my opinion. So this guy mark comes up to me yesterday and is talking shit about her to me. I say cool fuck off whatever. Ended up with him on the ground after he hit me. My ex texts after going through my friend for information about what happened. She asks me how I feel. I say about you nothing. About everything else. I can manage. She ignores me when I see her in person and we haven't talked face to face in a while.

I guess I'm just looking for advice on this situation. I'm currently in school on an in school suspension. Thinking about her and what she did drives me nuts.

23206,Dating,2ogvj0,"I had a nightmare where my GF was at another guys house and (in my nightmare) they fooled around, drank, slept (actual sleeping). 

The next day she was at someone else's house, because of a church event, but at the end of the night from what i understand it was only her, 2 guys, and the owner of the house (a chick). I've only met her 2 months ago, and she's been going to church for the last 6 months, so I should be worried right? They would've made a move by now if they were interested. 

She told me what was going on while it happened. She went out to buy drinks, went back to the house, and started drinking. I asked her if it was nice, or not, and she said it wasn't. She didn't like how it tasted. I told her that she should stop, since she doesn't like it... But she kept going. She kept drinking. She told me she felt tipsy, I told her to stop. She told me I tried walking to the bathroom and uhm.. lol and she still drank. She said she couldn't read whatsapp properly and she still drank. She told me she felt like crap, she still drank. Every single time. I told her to stop. She finished her first glass, went to the bathroom. She comes back and tells me friend poured more into my cup he's like drink more, last one. I tell her not to drink. Multiple times. I tried to call, she didnt pick up. 10 minutes later, she replied stopped already. It's now 3am, and I told her to go home, get some sleep. I think I'm gonna sleep here with 2 other people... At this point, Im.. just so pissed, so annoyed, but I don't want to just abandon her... so we talk and she tells me why she can't go home, asks if I'm mad. I told her to just sleep it off. She's going for volunteering the next day, and she needs to be up by 8. 6am, she finally goes back home, and I go to sleep when I know she's at home. Nothing to worry about. Next day, I told her about my nightmares from 2 night ago.

I told her about my nightmare, and she told me to stop worrying, that she'd never cheat on me, that she doesn't know many people here (i guess in her head its hard to cheat w/o knowing many people?). I told her that just knowing that one person could change everything. She keeps trying to convince me that even if she were to cheat, it would be hard... coz she's not pretty, and guys don't hit on her. By this point.. it seems like she wants to cheat but doesn't think that its possible for her &gt;.&gt; so i was pretty annoyed... She told me she won't cheat, but if she was being hit on, she doesn't think she would know. 

Then she asks me if I'm uncomfortable with her being close to some guys... I told her I don't mind her having male friends, coz I have female friends too. She told me to tell her if I think she's ever too close.  This just makes it seem like tell me when you think something is going on so I can protect myself and have answers if u catch me cheating or something... She asked if I was mad about her going to volunteer with the guy (I'm not. The guy she was with is pretty chill.) but I told her I was mad about her drinking. Really damn annoyed that she drank. She says that since she doesn't get drunk its ok. I told her i don't know that [if she was drunk] she replied with do u not trust me..? 

Her not being able to read whatsapp, feeling like crap, feeling tipsy, not being able to walk properly, apparently still makes it all OK since she wasn't drunk. Holy shit, thats what being drunk exactly means to me... 

I'm not against alcohol or her being with friends with other guys. But I'm not OK that u told me u didnt like the drink, but kept drinking, and kept drinking even after feeling like crap. I don't think she even likes me anymore. 

TL;DR - GF started drinking with 2 other guy friends, even tho she didnt like the drinks. She felt crappy, still didnt stop after I told her to. Signs point to her being drunk, she says she's not.

TL;DR: Dating nowadays seriously sucks. 

I'm a 22 year old girl and today has been my one year anniversary of being single so I've been feeling pretty gloomy recently. 

I've gone on a number of dates since then and have actually liked two guys since my breakup, but both individuals ended up not wanting something serious and were more interested in one night stands. I didn't oblige because that's not who I am. But it really hurts to put yourself out there and finally invest feelings in someone only to know you're not on the same page. I'm not really sure where I'm getting at with this -- I just think it's really hard at this age to find two people that meet, are both attracted to each other, have things in common, AND both want the same thing out of the relationship. To be honest, looking for a serious relationship at this age is hell because it seems like everyone wants something short term and that's not who I am. I've become so frustrated that it makes me angry/jealous to see happy couples in my classes. I'm not an angry person, I hate feeling this way, but my loneliness is consuming me. I feel so hopeless. Yes, I have friends and yes, I occupy myself with school and work but there is still some sort of void there. I miss having someone that only has eyes for you, thinks about you, loves you. 

I'm sorry for rambling. I know I didn't exactly pose a question. I just kind of wanted to let my feelings out. If anyone has been in the same situation or if this resonates with you please help me out.

Asked her out again. Dinner, then went to a nearby beach, we walked around a bit, looked at the waves and stuff. Blah blah.
Then I told her I liked her. Leaving out a lot of story here, but I didn't think of anything fancy beyond the location and time of day. 

She acknowledged that she started noticing that I clearly liked her during the earlier dates / times I took her out. She told me she'd never been with a guy before, and the most experience she had with guys was going to prom with a date.

I asked her how she felt about this all, and she told me that she didn't know what to feel. She said she wanted to get to know me better. Point taken. I made sure that she understood that I was going to keep asking her out, and she said that would be nice.

My friend/roommate later told me that I was a fool for telling her how I felt so early, but I honestly feel like clarifying how I felt to her early on was better than her misunderstanding me. Maybe I was wrong.

Well, I'm clueless as to really how to proceed. I took her home, we talked a bit more, and then I hugged her goodbye. I didn't try anything at the time, because I wasn't sure if I was ruining my chances, or what had really just happened hadn't really digested.

I don't know of my next move. I haven't been rejected entirely, nor is it really a solid answer. If anything, this feels like a trial period of some sorts, which puts me in an odd place.

What should I do? I plan to really just allow her to get to know me better through continued dates. But I've been thinking about it; maybe she isn't looking for a relationship at this time, and she was just letting me off the hook nicely by telling me I'll think about it.

Keeping that in mind, should I just drop this entirely, or keep up the pace?

23222,Breakups,3aefwt,"My ex-girlfriend and I broke up last night and I don't know what to do with myself. 


We both have our own issues.  She is insecure, and a lot of my problems with her branched from that basic core problem.  For me, I never took our misunderstandings that well.  I would get really down and borderline mean (not mean in a name-calling sense, but in a blunt sense).  The truth is -- I could never understand the stuff she did enough to empathize.  Well, yesterday, was the final straw when she told me she was interested in going to an event next weekend and invited me as an afterthought.  That weekend was my last weekend before I planned to move to New York (she would have been joining a few months later).  The point is, that was the last time I would see her for over two months, and for her to be so excited for the event that my departure isn't a blip on her radar hurt me deeply.  I asked her directly before she noticed, Be honest, do you plan on going to this event with or without me?, and that seemed to be the case.


Also last week, both her and my mother had heart issues.  I ran over to her mother's house to check on her well-being, and spend the weekend there with the whole family.  On the contrary, she never asked a single thing about my mother without being prompted.  She was so enveloped in her emotions about her own family that she clearly never thought about mine.


A final example would be being too busy to get me a birthday card.  I feel too stupid to explain all the details but suffice it to say we've had long talks about how Words of Affirmation are important to me and I save all of the meaningful cards and letters I get.


A break up is a break up, but we were supposed to move to New York.  I am literally supposed to leave in 3 weeks.  We've been feverishly looking for apartments together and I was getting so excited about our future.  Now, everything is changed.  I can't afford Manhattan as a single person (we were going to split a studio), my credit had taken a hit recently so I'm worried about finding a place.  We were supposed to finally visit my parents next weekend.  Everything is in completely disarray.  This move was something I was so excited for and now I feel so much doubt.  I'm normally a confident and relaxed person -- I just always envisioned living with somebody I loved at 28 and not a random roommate in a new place.

I'd also like to add that she cried a lot during the break up and said that she can't seem to make me happy, and she doesn't know what to do.  I explained her previously that she keeps making the same mistakes and I would be happy if I didn't have to deal with this seemingly every other week.  Well anyway, she told me she had a breakdown and then sealed the deal later that night.  I hung up before I got a detailed explanation because I couldn't take it -- at the time I saw it as a cowardly act at this point in time.  We're usually so good when we're together in person, and we would have had that opportunity today, but we're bad long distance because we both travel for work.  I did admit previously that I was hard on her for her mistakes, and she cried a lot as a result of our disagreements.  I don't know want to be the guy that rides someone for messing up, I'm never that person, but they were just so frequent I felt like an afterthought too often.

TL;DR - Girlfriend dumped me at very inopportune time and my bright, exciting future is now not feeling so fun.  Already took job offer in new location fully planning on making the journey together.

This happens almost all the time (80%+), and the other times I get numbers, and in maybe &lt;30% of those circumstances do I end up getting dates with those women.

But I've found that if I wait long enough (sometimes a *very long* time, as in over a year) I'll eventually find a super cute woman that will chase me down.  It's tough because while I get huge amounts of rejection after asking women, I am also used to having people I'm attracted to pursue me.

Do you often find that it's the case that it's just best to wait until you find someone who seems quite attracted to you, versus continuing to approach women who don't show a lot of initial interest?  I know that eventually I'll find someone who thinks I'm splendid, but getting rejected so often just feels infuriating when I think to myself (man, I know someone this cool has asked me out before, and while I know people have individual reasons for how they feel, this is still frustrating...)

I've always heard the common wisdom, that men chase, but ultimately women are the deciding factor in whether a relationship has a chance or not, and I've *definitely* found that this is true.

My husband recieved a nude text from an ex co worker kept it on his phone for months. The only reason I know is because he showed our friend. The friend hated he did that to me and let me know.


Last night our friend was over and got drunk and told me a few days ago my husband showed him a nudie he was sent of an ex co worker. They fought about it and I ended up having to take him home because he was way to drunk to drive. When I talked to my husband I asked him to be 100% honest with me. He said he would. He said the only reason he had her number is because he had to call her into work. When she wouldn't answer he used his personal cell to text her. So that is how she had his number.

He said she got a boob job and was proud of it and was showing everyone. He got a text from her after he no longer worked there saying can I send you a pic he said sure. Then he got the nudes. He gave  her a compliment on them and that was the end of that.

I know he didn't ask for the pics but this girl knew he was married and had a pregnant wife!!!! He kept the fucking pics for months! I asked him why he said because he doesn't delete anything. I just can't wrap my head around the fact that he never deleted them. I am hurt he gave her compliments instead of saying fuck off im happily married and delteting them. So if I wasn't informed they would be there right now!! 

I feel extreamly hurt and very betrayed. My ideal senario in all this was if he showed me she sent it. Showed me he didn't respond and just deleted it right then and there. 


I feel like he was unfaithful to me. Would that be going to far to say? I always felt like he was the one person I could trust. Should I leave him over this and break up our family of 4? I just can't believe he would do such a thing. I don't even feel like he is remorseful for his actions. He seemes more annoyed at me for being upset and hurt. He did say he would make it up to me anyway he can but so far not showing that at all.

Anywho, so we get along pretty well and she seems pretty cool. However, on the physical side of things it's a little different.

She almost always initiates it, and has even told me that she gets very, very horny. She has also told me that she gets off of going down on guys.

It took some time, but after a while she came to me and told me that not too long ago she was raped and wasn't ready to be touched. Which is completely fine with me. I understand and have asked her if she needed anything, etc. She established her boundaries and I respect them.

I work excessively long hours right now, have finally made awesome new friends and have fun social activities, and have no desire to be in a committed relationship right now.

Fast forward found a great guy, we hit it off, instant attraction, general awesomeness. We went on a date and I already started to feel some red flags as he gushed about what a great fit he thought we were, and how we had great conversation. I explained to him again very clearly I'm leaving in December, I just want a friend with benefits with no attachment until I leave. A relationship or long distance isn't an option, or something I want. He seemed to completely agree and just said he's just naturally a romantic, but just got out of a bad relationship and wanted to rebound and have something casual as well. 

It's been about two months of fantastic hooking up but he keeps alluding to wanting more, or just texting me just to say sweet nothings. It's always very casual like if only I could show you off to all my friends when I go to this wedding, or when we do xyz in the future, or you're the type of person I want to be with. Something to the effect of those mixed in to the evening, or a conversation. When I confronted him about it he just says its his nature, he doesn't mean anything by it, he doesn't expect a relationship, and I shouldn't be alarmed. 

So my question is am I making up red flags in my head? Do I just accept he's naturally more affectionate than I am at leave it at that? Or should I worry he's going to get attached and I really should end things? My rational brain is also certainly compromised because the physical chemistry is almost electric and for being a friends with benefits situation I could not ask for more perfect attraction. 

I don't want to be unethical and engage in behavior that may potentially hurt someones feelings in the future. On the other hand I think that people should really be self aware and if this isn't something he wants he should end things.

So anyway, I dropped the gift on Monday. No one was home. There was some difficulties actually finding the correct house (there were no house numbers clearly visible, and it was a dead end street, and my GPS was wrong as well as Google Maps). But after a while, I got the right house and left it on her steps where a few other UPS packages were waiting. Never heard anything from her. I was hoping for some sort of message from her at least confirming she got it (what if her mom threw it away before she got home?) I didn't really expect a Thank you, but it would have been nice, considering the last messages we ever sent were not even a goodbye. 

---

But anyway, it's almost been about 48 hours since then. According to everything I've read and listened to (whether other people or advice) is that I should be better now. Snap my fingers and be ready to meet someone else and believe that there is someone out there who supposedly is better than her. While I'm doing okay, I'm not better. As I said before in the above topic, I really am discouraged. Even with the guaranteed mutual attraction between us, and the fact that she loved my romantic gestures and we already *discussed* how we both want to date, it didn't work. I'm very discouraged in that. Also that I have a very difficult time believing there is some mythical better girl. I know she was a human being and no humans are perfect. But she was perfect to *me*. She was everything I could ever want and some things I didn't even *know* I wanted. As I said before, I'm very discouraged and disheartened, as well as hurt and disappointed.

Also, I just keep having this image of her with some other guy. Knowing that someone *else* gets to make her happy. Hold her hand. Take her to football games. Watch movies at her house (like we were planning). Just simple things like *that* really hurt me, not even *considering* the mental image of her actually having sex with someone else. That mental image practically brings me to tears and makes me want to start drinking to kill these thoughts. I know that I have no control over what she does and I have no evidence there is another guy (but based on what I said on the previous topic, it's a possibility), but I just thought that she was someone so special to me. Hell, she could have been The One for me. I really believed that. But knowing that someone *else* gets to make her happy is killing me.

---

How do I stop these thoughts? It's not like I'm actively trying to imagine this stuff or think about her. But I just am subconsciously. When something reminds me of her, I *try* to not think about her. I can mentally change the channel in my brain, but it just comes right back. And even if I don't think about her directly (for instance, her with another guy) it's in the back of my mind constantly. How do I stop these thoughts? How do I actually *believe* someone else is better for me, and she out there? (Sounding like Ted Mosby here) How do I get better and actually believe *she* is out there? (Hell, how do I even find her?)

23258,Breakups,2bdxwp,"Hi. Quick backstory on whole situation. First proper girlfriend, both were 15 at the time, lasted 18 months. We broke up, were apart for two months and then got back together and it didn't work out. I realize now I was the issue. 

Bit of background on me: Grew up being told I'm am very mature for my age and that I'm very easy and a pleasure to talk to. Adults tend to conversate with me quite well. Developed trust issues because of what I saw happening around me. 

She would say things that made it so so hard for me to believe and would constantly twist my words, or only capture part of what I was saying. I look at it now and go crap, I was in the wrong wasn't I?. 

My friends all know I can lie and that I'm really good at it (so they say). My girlfriend at the time started to see this with how I acted around people and how I told them lies about how I felt, or I would turn the conversation away from me and my feelings. I have severe trust issues, I don't fully trust one person on this planet. She was the one I trusted most, and it took us months of work and tears to finally get me to open up to her. After we broke up the first time, she went and told a few people some personal things about me that were meant to be just between us, we had a huge promise on that. 

I wont go into too much about what she did because this is about what I need to do, not her, but just quickly, she went onto my Facebook account about a week after we had broken up, and saw that a couple of days after we broke up, I had told another female I think I have feelings for her. Never once did I cheat, let's just make that clear. This other girl shut me down really quickly and I was able to put that to rest. I'm pretty sure it was just a rebound. However, my ex told me that her friend worked at Facebook and saw some messages between me and this girl. They were flirty. AGAIN THIS WAS NOT DURING OUR RELATIONSHIP. This turned out to be a lie when I confronted her about it and she admitted she went on. It is important to note that during our relationship I said I wouldn't become friendly again with this other girl.. I fucked up. 

Anyway, so I see now that I constanly was looking at everything she sent to me in messages as a negative thing. I would look at messages and think they were her having a go at me. Because of how good she knows I can be when lying, no matter what I say when trying to say sorry, she wont believe me. She want's nothing to do with me anymore. And this is after she said she'll always love me. 

She said I always treated her like less than my friends, and would ignore her. I see what she is saying now. I never realized it when we were together. I can see now that I have a tendancy to quickly change who I'm talking to, or change topic nowadays. 

I admit here that I don't know how to treat her, I don't know what I am meant to or not meamt to do. I am a terrible boyfriend. I miss her though, I'm in tears almost every night over the fact she is gone now. 

I also am going through a few things which is always playing on my mind and are tearing me apart inside. They are to do with my family and so they were affecting me so heavily during our relationship and still do.

Please help me with what I should do next to fix the situation and become a better person. I just want her to realize how sorry I am for being a dick. Even if it means I can't get her back, I want her to believe I am sorry and that my words aren't a lie. I want her to be happy... And it seems like she's happier without me... It used to be the other way around. I feel I have made this post very poor quality... But I just need help Reddit. I'm so lost on what to do. 

Tl;dr : I am apparently a very good liar and my words have little to no worth to her anymore. I constantly would look at how she acted towards me as a negative thing. I have no idea how I was meant to treat her because a lot of the time I would do something wrong, but I miss her like crazy and would love her back. I want to prove to her I am truly sorry, and I just want her to be happy, with or without me. ",Breakups I (17M) have messed up badly.

23260,Dating,27pea5,"Last night I was studying with my friend at one of the residence halls at my campus. 4:00 am rolls around and we start getting hungry and need a break so we decide its as good of a time as ever to go to the 24 hour corner store. On our way down we pass by a study room with a glass wall and I see a very cute girl studying and her friend laying on a couch.

We go to the store, buy our stuff, and on our way back we pass by the same room only this time we ended up making eye-contact. I decided, since I'm single, to write a note to her saying that I thought she was cute and good luck on her finals with my phone number at the bottom. I walked back to her study room, taped it to the glass wall, knocked on the glass twice to get her attention, and a few seconds after her seeing me, I walked off with my friend waiting around the corner. 

I ended up getting a text this morning around 8:30 from an unknown number saying Thanks. good luck on finals too. I honestly didn't think it would work and I would never hear from her. I don't know her name, or anything about her but she is really pretty and I know I want to ask her out. 

My question is how should I respond seeing as we don't know each others names or anything about each other, other than we probably go to the same school.

and I realize it says 22 in there, she just had a birthday this weekend.

So if you dont read the other one long story short I met this girl on POF (dating site) 2 years ago, had a date that didnt go so well but I think we both liked eachother and thought the other didnt because of that.

Fast foward to now, shes freshly single and hit me up like a week after the breakup. We've been hanging out and talking a TON, but recently on her birthday she broke down crying over her breakup like 3 times while we were out 'celebrating' her birthday. Even mentioned being in love with him and wanting to marry him. At the end of the night I was the only on out with her that didnt bail on her.

Now we're still talking and she wants to hang out almost every day. Here's my problem, though, I made a discovery this morning. I have an OKCupid profile and she apparently just made one too because it went into my quiver (quiver is daily matches that havnt been in your quiver before so mostly new users).

So do I mention that I saw it? I havent actually looked at her profile since that would give her a visit from me meaning she'd know I was on there and knew she was too.

I was thinking of saying like hey your okcupid profile was in my quiver this morning lol, why dont we just go out on a real date? can i say something like that? I dont know what to do here because shes been giving me all this attention like she's interested, but then why would she create a dating site profile when she already had me around? AND not only that but when I was talking to her during one of her birthday moments she said she wanted nothing to do with relationships for a while.

Anyways the key thing to remember here is- before this, I hadn't talked to her since that first date like 2 years ago. And she only hit me up after she was single (had been in relationships most of those 2 years until now)

So what do I do? Just ask her out on a real date?

tl;dr- hanging out/talking with a girl I went on a date with years ago and then I found her on a dating site?

23267,Breakups,20ihml,"My bf just broke up with me yesterday, officially. We've been in a serious relationship for almost 3 years now.


In terms of what happened: He broke up with me 2 weeks ago but then decided the next day that he wanted a break instead. This was supposed to give each other time to think about what had happened and whether or not we wanted to be together again.

The first main reason why he broke up with me was because I was depressed all the time. He then later realized during the break that it was his fault for making me sad because he was not doing what he was supposed to do as a boyfriend. That I was never really depressed and was actually happy. (Later he told me honestly that he never even wanted to fix anything but he doesn't know why)

Then the reason changed from that to the fact that I was going to be going to Ohio for college while he stayed here (Chicago) for college. He had told me that he doesn't want to go through a second breakup after I'm gone, that a long distant relationship will not work for us.

Now the reason is because he hasn't been wanting to be with me anymore for 3 months now. He didn't tell me anything about this until a few days ago.

But, the thing is, we both still love each other. He basically told me that he still loves me but doesn't want to be in a relationship with me now. He didn't want to lose me so he wants us to work on a friendship with each other. And the reason for the friendship is so that if there is a chance that after I come back from Ohio 4 years from now we can get back together. That he doesn't want us to just be ex'es.

However I already know that that seems almost impossible. I'm confused on what I should do and how I should feel.

I know for a fact that I still love him but at the same time I feel like I'm just a back up for a what-if that will probably never happen. I don't want to hate him but I feel angry that I've done all I can and yet all of my efforts are being reduced to just a friendship. I sometimes feel like I just want to tell him, I am so happy that I don't have to be sad because of you anymore, and make him feel awful for doing this to me.

Btw, I'm really sorry about making this so long. I'm actually a long time lurker and never actually used my account on Reddit. I apologize if I'm not doing this correctly.

23282,Breakups,3i0j39,"Alright, so I've been dating this girl for 3 years. I met her because she was my best friend's sister. I was 17 and she was 15. We instantly clicked. Total love at first sight or whatever, straight out of a movie. Best friend was cool with it, and I'm still friends with him today. That wasn't an issue. It was my junior year of high school and her freshman year when we started dating (2012), and we were inseparable. We were each other's lives. 

Fast forward a year and a half later (2013) and I'm about to go to college. This initiates a few problems. A) She's constantly worrying that I'm going to dump her before I leave, or that I'll fall for some college girl. B) She has issues with depression/anxiety that she takes medicine for daily. But when she starts stressing too much, she stops taking it and it fucks everything up. (This is important info for later on.) I assure her that she's the only girl I'm interested in (it was true) and that it's insanely important for her to keep taking her meds. This is the first real major issue, but it's resolved without too much fanfare. 

So I choose a college that is only about an hour away from our hometown, with the thinking being that I can come home on the weekends to be with her. And that plan worked out. Every single weekend of my freshman year, I would drive an hour home and be with her practically all weekend. Looking back, I realize how much experience I missed out on and I'm kicking myself as we speak. However, at the time, I just wanted to spend time with her. 

Anyway, around February or March (2014), she begins to act sorta odd. She was more distant than ever, not quite talking to me as much, etc. Then in May (right before finals), she says she wants to break up. While I kinda saw it coming, I felt completely blindsided and had no clue what to do with myself. I get home for the summer and immediately start applying for jobs, knowing that I'll go crazy if I sit at home all summer. Well, the breakup only lasted about 3 weeks. She texts me asking to meet her to talk. I saw yes, of course, and she tells me everything. She stopped taking her medicine, started cutting again (previously hadn't cut since before we began dating), and was talking to an ex who was about to move to another state. But she realized that she fucked up and wants to get back together. I say yes.

We're together through the summer and have a blast together, just like the old days before I went to college. 24/7 hanging out (besides when I was working) and she's fine because she's on her meds. Welp, my sophomore year of college/her senior year of high school begins in August, and we do the same as before. I came home on the weekends. This time though, she started driving up to my apartment and staying the night. But, by November she wants to breakup again. 

So we break up, and I'm, again, lost. Neither of us were completely committed to the breakup though, because we'd still talk a little bit and hook-up sometimes too. By January (2015), though, she wants to completely break up. We stop all communications. This lasts for a month. In February she calls me, crying, asking if she can come to my apartment to talk. Now, I recognized that I should say no, but I felt bad. Knowing her history with depression and self-harm, I felt like I should be there for her. So I say yes.

She tells me that she's been miserable since the breakup. She kinda had a thing with a guy but she said it was awful. She's been miserable, cutting, not taking meds, failing classes, etc. So I console her, and try to help her out. This leads to us getting back together by March. During this time, though, I had also started go to a therapist because I really, really needed it because of all this stuff going on with her. But, we're back together and everything's okay. It's not quite like it used to be. We're not talking 24/7 and hanging out as much, but still quite a bit. And honestly, I felt like the space was good for us. But in June or July (hard to remember exactly) she wants to break up. 

Now, up until now, every time she wanted to break up, she never really gave a reason. I now attribute that to the depression, because she had quit taking it every time we broke up. Common denominator. This time, however, she tells me I'm boring, all her friends dislike me and say she should be with somebody more outgoing and adventurous, and also that she wants to be on her own for a bit, especially since she's about to go to college (which was, by the way, the same college I go to).

So now we'd broken up 3 times. I was there for her when I didn't need to be, but I knew she needed somebody. I cared for her more than anybody, including herself, and it means nothing? Plus all the things she said about me personally, I was in total wtf mode. The next day I was super low and I wrote a suicide note. I never intended on acting it out, but I just wanted to know what it felt like to prepare for a suicide. I was just tired of feeling so much sadness because of her. The next day I got really, really high with a friend, and from that day on, I was totally alright with the breakup. I had gone from sad to angry. How could somebody who I treated so well, treat me so badly?

Two weeks later, she shows up at my job while I'm closing the store. I was the only one there and it was after hours. She's crying. I've seen this episode before. We talk. She's as lost as I was before, and I'm clearly doing better. But we end up talking for hours and over the next few months, occasionally hook up, go on dates, etc. She apologizes for everything she said to me, and tells me that I'm the only one she wants to be with. We were basically back together without the label. 

Now, last week was move-in day and we're going to the same college now. Finally. This is what we've been waiting for. No more only seeing each other on the weekend. No more parents interfering in our relationship. We're kinda on our own now. I thought this was gonna be good. Well after she moved in, I saw her once and she was super cranky and said some very rude things. Since then, she actively tried to avoid me. I called her a few days ago and ask what's going on, why she doesn't seem to want to see me anymore. She goes, Well, I mean, we DID break up. NIGGA, TWO MONTHS AGO. AND YOU'RE JUST NOW ACTING ON IT? Needless to say I was confused. I texted her later asking to clarify her shit (politely) and she says well I thought you'd know this was going to happen because I was going to college. I respond, first saying that no, I didn't know it was coming, since we just spent the last couple months acting like we're together. Two, I ask her if maybe she thinks it's a little fucked up to just string me along over the summer until she got to college and drop me once she had her friends. She says idk, probably is. I ask if she would rather me just not care and she says yes. I'm now completely dumbfounded. She's not acting like herself AT ALL and won't talk to me. The worst thing is that I don't know why and I'm worried about her health. 

So, /r/relationships, I'm asking for your advice on what to do. I'm almost expecting her to show up at my door in a month or so, looking for help. And I want her to be healthy, but if she's not, and I turn her away, will that drive to her more than cutting herself? I don't want to do anything that will hurt her (and I still love her), though I know I still have to look out for myself. I guess I just want to know how to do that. I'm only posting this because I'm so low right now.

23283,Dating,35gkmq,"(These aren't exact ages but they accurately reflect our difference. I'm 20 and he is 26.) 

Backstory: So I am a girl, and I've had feelings for one of my male coworkers for a year or so. Prior to that we were just close acquaintances, I guess you could say. After late last year we really started becoming friends. Since then I started to feel that he was starting to develop feelings for me, and I knew myself that my feelings for him were getting stronger.

Then, through getting his phone number one night, I found out that he was moving out west. For whatever reason, a spur the moment decision led me to admitting my feelings for him. He then admitted that he felt basically the exact same way about me, but really wouldn't have done anything considering the fact he was moving and such.

After that night we started texting constantly. We would start early in the morning and go back and forth all day (the all day texting did happen in the beginning, but really started when he moved). Through this contact we found out that we get along insanely well. We found that we are very similar people, and we just work if that makes sense. We became really close. He would say things like I feel like I get you and you get me, I've never met anybody as similar to me as you are in tons of ways, etc.

We continued this texting for a while and just finding more and more similarities between us and becoming closer. I know I personally found myself starting to fall for him, even though we have quite the distance between us. 

I also noticed that he started doing things that he hadn't ever done before. He started opening up to me and showing his vulnerable side. He started showing me some of his insecurities and would get a little bit nervous if I didn't respond to his texts and such. He's always been a very confident and well adjusted person, so for him to start doing that and showing me that was something I'd never seen before. 

Then, after we had a really close and detailed text exchange, I noticed that he pulled away from me. He wasn't texting me as much, it would take hours between responses (where prior I had to wait half an hour at most) and he just started keeping me at arms length.

So, I asked him what was up, and why he was doing that. He then said that he didn't want to lead me on and make me think he wanted more than friendship (which doesn't even make sense seeing as we don't even live in the same state anymore, in my opinion). This took me by surprise seeing as it just kinda seemed to be an unspoken thing between us that, at least for right now considering the circumstance, we were just friends. So I asked him if I had done anything or said anything that made him feel like I wanted more, or did anything inappropriate for the context of our relationship, to which he said no, but he would have been lying if he said the thought of me being led on didn't cross his mind.

So, we cleared the air, and I think everything's fine. He does it again like 2 weeks later. He randomly pulls away, and I'm left here thinking that I did something wrong or something, since there had been no reason for him to pull away again. Again I asked what was up, and he said that he didn't want to be potentially sending mixed signals and wanted to clarify that he only wanted friendship and didn't want things misinterpreted.

I was actually upset this time. First, I thought we worked through things before. Second, he's making me feel like I'm acting weird or doing weird things that would make him have to say again that we're just friends. I just felt like he wasn't being straightforward and he embarrassed me. He was the one acting strangely and making a lot of the moves, not me.

I told him a much more eloquent version of my last paragraph, and he gave in and said that I hadn't done anything to make him think otherwise and that he felt like he was the one saying things. He also said that he was overthinking everything and he wasn't listening to his inner reason and such. He then apologized profusely, and wanted to act like he'd never said anything.

The only reason I'm writing this is because I feel like he is scared. He's never acted this way with anyone before, and I feel like he's projecting his feelings onto me. I only feel this because of the fact that he's the one getting really close to me, pulling away, and then feeling the need to emphasize to me that we're just friends. He's the one who's saying that he's overthinking things and feeling like he's saying things that lead me on, but then gets embarrassed and sort of projects all of that onto me instead of owning up the first time.

He is a good guy. I've known him long enough to know that he is a quality person, and he isn't playing games with me or doing this for fun. He's very morally sound. He is also logical, and a reasonable person, which is why I'm questioning such illogical behavior.

23292,Infidelity,1gt821,"This isn't about me so much, so I'd like to focus the advice on my friend's situation. I've (25m) been friends with Kevin (26m) for almost 15 years, and we grew up together. Went through a lot of different stuff together as kids and in college, and he is probably my closest friend in this world. Kevin married a great girl last year, and he seemed to have been happy in married life. I moved due to work late last year, and Kevin and I haven't seen each other since then. He ended up taking a few days off to come and visit me this week, and we've kind of reverted to old times. 

Kevin over the past few years has become more moral... he doesn't flirt with other women doesn't do drugs/drink heavily, and is just an all around good, follow the rules type of guy. I'm a good person too, but just not as good as Kevin, and I definitely have my vices. Kevin and I used to just go crazy back in our teenage years and early 20s, but for the past few years, with his wife, he has mellowed out a lot. 

So Kevin flew in on Tuesday afternoon, and we just had a quiet night. We caught up and then had dinner with my girlfriend and her sister, and then watched the game. Wednesday, I had to work and he had some shopping to do, so that was that. Wednesday night though we decide to go to a local bar to just have some drinks, and I started to talk to a group of girls. They were going to go dancing later and they invited us. I was down, but Kevin was kind of uneasy with the idea, but he eventually gave it his okay. There was one girl who took a liking to him, and she was kind of attached to his hip at the club. We danced and had a pretty decent time at the club, and two of the girls ended up coming back to my place. I fucked my girl, and I know Kevin was in the guest bedroom in the same bed with his girl. He swears nothing went down, but I'm kind of skeptical. This girl was *all over him*... like grinding with him all night at the club, cuddling with him in the car on the way back, and I'm about 90% sure they hooked up. Not that I'm judging. 

Thursday we both ended up sleeping most of the day, and were initially planning a chill night, but we started reminiscing and came up with the idea of going to some strip joints. When we were younger (21/22) we used to go all the time, and it was fun, but limited in that we never had much money. We would talk about how it would be if we had actual money, and now that we both have some money the idea came up again. The clubs across the river where I live are kind of notoriously permissive, and it was kind of exciting in a taboo way. 

Kevin had about a $100 cash, and then took out $200 from the ATM and I had $300 cash as our budget. We didn't take any cards or anything like that, so this was our limit. The first club we get too is kind of of slow, and kind of hood, so we bounced after a few minutes and just ate the cover. The next club was much more in line with what we were looking for, and we sat down and bought drinks and eventually two girls came over. Should probably point out at this point, that Kevin left his ring at home (on his own volition). We end up buying the girls drinks (at like fucking $9 a drink...), and they are sitting on our laps. Both are really hot... or at least hot under the lighting there. Great tits, great ass, and fit. And not wearing much either (g-string and bra). 

Anyways, we are talking to the girls there and they are obviously pushing privates (somethings never change lol), and they mention that they have a VIP room for $250 an hour. We are talking and we ask them if it'll be worth it, and they say definitely (but what are they going to say, haha). Kevin and I essentially say, fuck it, and we go for the VIP room and the girls come with us. There they are hanging out with us and drinking (those expensive fucking drinks), and eventually they start dancing for us. Some more shit goes down, and the lap dances are uh, interactive. Kevin and his girl are a bit away, but I can see them a little, and he was enjoying himself. I was too, and I ended up getting carried away beyond just tit groping, and fingered the stripper. She was down though, and she ended up blowing me (with a condom). Kevin, same situation... I can't say if he fingered her or not, but he did get a blowjob (with a condom... I know because I had to give the girl the condom). After that point, its getting kind of long (and time is literally money), and we try to make our exit. The total ended up being like just under $500 to the club and we left the two girls the last hundred. 

We get home and just crash. Kevin's flight out was today at 11:30 (AM), and we didn't talk much until the drive-out to the airport, and he just told me that he fucked up and this entire week never happened. I offered to cover for him, if he needed me to, but he said it would be okay. I could tell though that he was kind of pissed, and I probed a bit, and tried to get him to talk. Eventually, he explodes on me and says essentially he does stupid shit like this when I'm around, and that I'm fucked up. Basically, blaming everything on me. That we should have just watched the game rather than wasting money and time on the strippers. And that this was just all stupid, the entire trip. We were both kind of going at one another, and I just dropped him off at ticketing and drove away. 

I'm a little pissed off at Kevin, because in my mind, he chose to do all of this. I wasn't forcing him to do anything, and he was up for it as much as I was. I understand its more serious, seeing as he is married, but to blame it all on me is kind of a bitch move. I'm not sure what the step is with our friendship. Do I apologize to him? Do I wait for him to apologize? Or are we kind of just growing apart... For a brief moment, I was pissed and debated telling his wife about what went down, but I think that is callous and cold, and won't. I just don't want this to hang over our friendship, and I want to mend fences. He is seriously one of my closest friends, and I don't want to lose what we have.

23293,Infidelity,224kkc,"So, I'l try to make this as simple and succinct as I can... I dunno if that's gonna work though! XD

So me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over a year. This is also the first serious relationship I've ever been in. When we first started dating, he asked me if he could sleep with other people on the side. Me, being inexperienced, and trying to be open-minded, said yes.

A few months ago, things started getting a bit more complicated. He told me he was interested in having a D&amp;S (Dom/Sub, Master/Pet, whatever you want to call it) relationship with another person [23M] (my boyfriend being the dom/master, the other being the sub/pet). Again, I agreed, trying to be open-minded.

I quickly realized, though, that I was getting jealous very, very easily. Things started to get a lot worse recently, when I realized he was developing a much closer emotional bond with this other person, past just a physical relationship.

Every time I've brought the subject up with my boyfriend, he's tried to tell me that the relationship he has with this other person isn't at all like the relationship WE have. He says it's like he just got a puppy or something, that I'm still the one he wants to spend his life with, and that I have nothing to worry about. Still doesn't help me get over it. I don't think I CAN get over it. I've tried and tried and tried, for months now.

I also have a feeling that their relationship is changing my boyfriend in... well... undesirable ways. For example, one, he's lately been much more prone to getting irritated at me (though that could just be the weather - he hates the spring and summer). Two, when we're having sex, he can't seem to be able to get off without choking me, which is new, and not something I enjoy. And three, he also mentioned the possibility of trying knife-play with the other person, something I thought he would never even consider. He agreed not to do it soon as I vehemently forbade it, though, so that's something.

The real kicker to all this is that a part of me REALLY doesn't want to break them up. I want the both of them to be happy, and I feel that breaking them up would do more harm to them than it would do good to me. I want everyone to be happy in this situation, but I'm not sure that's possible. I'm at my wit's end. I feel like if this goes on for much longer, then I'll have no choice but to leave my boyfriend simply out of defense of my own sanity. I don't know what to do.

Eventually he made out with another girl a few weeks later and they went home together while he is still together with Elisa who is waiting on him back home.

23317,Dating,2sgxuq,"Hello all,
I am a senior in high school who has had an incredibly difficult time getting a girlfriend. 

Just a little background: I'm an outsider in a very small country town.

I moved here in 7th grade and I haven't had a real girlfriend ever (just a lot of brief, empty escapades that were based solely on physical attraction). 

People reject me here. I'm a hard working, mature person, and I tend to get along with adults much more than my peers.

 I'm an attractive guy (no personal bias I'm told I am often) who is very successful, mature and nice. I pride myself in being a gentleman and I tend to avoid the disgraceful trends of my peers such as asking for sexts. I'm constantly told by adults that my full ride to 3 schools including a military academy, being valedictoian... etc would make me very enticing to girls. It hasn't. 

I get dates, but girls tend to waffle on plans, give me a lot of maybes and leave me hanging. They never outright tell me anything: they simply fade away or lie their way out of my attention.

 I'm not saying I'm perfect. I can be a little arrogant at times but I like to think I keep myself in check. It's incredibly disheartening as I'm pretty lonely. I don't have very great friends, and can't seem to find any good ones with the clique like culture of my town.

It was a weird break up we walked in the park together sat down talked for 3 hours straight about what we loved about each other and what we didn't love. We even kissed before saying good bye. 

After that he tried to initiate contact mostly I guess because we got along pretty well. Lots of common interests. We've played video games together, went rollerblading, studied together etc. I haven't responded any of his messages during the summer break. But when the classes started we sort of started flirting again. Then I flipped and started a fight because of his mixed signals. (mistake I know) Then he stopped talking to me for a few weeks. Lately we have been talking. Mostly about classes and assignments but also about our mutual interests. We talk mostly on Facebook. Hanging out together is still a bit awkward so when we are alone in a classroom or the campus cafeteria I prefer to not trying to hold a conversation. Instead I act like something came up and I leave.

23327,Breakups,2x2kjj,"It all started spring 2007. I, 17 at the time, first met her, 18 at the time, at the vending machine in the cafeteria. She was wearing the FIRST robotic team shirt of our high school. We talked for a little bit, never heard from her again until she added me on facebook during the fall of 2007, while I was in college. After leaving college, I moved back home. We talked a little bit more on facebook, then we finally met up. 


The attraction was pretty instant, we did a lot of things together. No pressure of sex or anything like that. I was a virgin, she wasn't. Something was off though, we would break-up every few months or so, take a break then get back together. The whole thing was sort of random and hard to get away from since we had mutual friends. This happened about four times until I got fed up and ended it. 


A few months later, I decided to join the military. It was easy to not think about her since I was moving around a lot and staying busy. She was still there though. She was doing odd jobs around the states during this time. We got a hold of each other over facebook again and talked about what happened. Then it moved to regular chatting. 


Once my contract ended, I came back home. She moved back before I did, and we agreed to meet. History repeated itself and we started dating again. We were very attracted to each other and it showed, but something was holding her back. One time we were together with some friends and smoked, it was a good since we finally had sex for the first time ever. Afterwards we went back to my place and messed around some more. 


I took her home after that, but she left her phone in my car. This wasn't realized until after I got back. My gut was telling me somethings wrong and to check her phone. I did, there were a few nude pictures of this guy that she was seeing before me. I left it alone, mainly because I invaded her privacy and I shouldn't have looked in the first place. One month goes by and things return to normal, less passionate, but normal. 


Until one day, she wants to talk. I go to her house and we quietly talk about what's been going on and how she thinks we need a break. Same shit, different time. So I get fed up and say ok, it's your life go have fun. She asks if that's it and I drive off. Later, she texts me about being friends on facebook and blah blah. I tell her I don't give a shit, it's just facebook. 


In response, she says that I'm more of an ass than I was before. I say that I'm just less of a doormat and I'm not taking shit as much as I used to. Finally starts talking about all the things that she's been feeling over the past couple of weeks, but has neglected to tell me. This was mid-October 2013.

Or if it was her fault and how could someone be like that. It's negatively affected my performance in work, school, sex, relationships, etc. All I want to do is have someone give me clear answers on what happened, and how I can change even if I did nothing wrong.

I [24F] happily agreed, because he seemed like a really cool guy and I wanted to learn salsa since forever. And then he became really friendly to me, we would chat on Facebook all the time, talk on the phone for hours about nothing and everything, go dancing salsa twice a week. We would spend all our free time together, he would take me out to have coffee, eat dinner, watch movies, bring me small cute gifts to work, do all the things couples do EXCEPT he wouldn’t show any interest in getting physical – no kissing, hugging, hand-holding, anything.

I like her little mannerisms and her way of speaking. She also looks great. I love the small physical imperfections she has (that sounds so dumb).  
  
The reason why I never acted on my emotions is because I never got any signals or hints from her that she might be even remotely attracted to me. We've talked about our past relationships before, among other things, but it was nothing more than talk. From conversation, it seems like she's into more aggressive, macho guys, which is different from my type. In spite of that, I keep wanting her to like me.  
  
The thing that really confuses me is the fact that I don't think I would want to date her, or even be friends with her, if she wasn't my boss or if I had met her outside of work. I'm not fond of her personality, and we don't share any common interests. She seems shallow, lazy, and boring at times.

23342,Breakups,1ulrxx,"I met my girlfriend back in September of 2012 and we started dating on the 25th of that month. It was pretty tumultuous for the first few weeks as it was one of my first relationships where I had cared, but it soon smoothed out and was pretty calm all the way up till she broke up with me. I'll describe us both so you get a sense of what we both want.


I am an extreme introvert who likes being alone quite a lot. I like to learn about scientific and spiritual stuff in my down time. I also like to lift (dare I say bodybuilding?), and enjoy seeing results in these parts of my life. I never was one for relationships but this girl struck me in a way I couldn't resist.


She is an attractive petite girl from private school. Way out of my league for sure considering I was pretty chunky when we first got together. An extreme extrovert because of some traumatic events in her early childhood (abandonment issues, rape, abuse) and says she likes to talk and be around people or else her mind wanders to those topics. She also is smart in a manipulative way. She bounces from relationship to relationship with days in between... Even our 15 month relationship...


What I want in a girl is someone who likes exercising as well (she didnt), someone who can carry an intellectual/philosophical relationship (she couldnt), someone who encourages me (she did), somewhat attractive (she was almost too attractive... it worried me), and hopefully shares the same learning interests as me like chemistry and theoretical physics (for an asian in a private school, she was dull as shit.)


Now you can obviously see how we each weren't exactly what the other wanted but it miraculously worked very well. We were extremely sexually compatible, we could hold a conversation forever (albeit not one of my choosing lol), and I loved cuddling and just being with her. 


Well she broke up with me maybe 2 weeks ago for no reason and asked for me back, which when I feel betrayed you can bet I'll say hell no, and then I didn't hear from her. I was alright till a week later when she texted me about an agreement we made when we were still together (hooking up). I find out the day after she asked for me back she went over to an older dudes house and was raped and wanted me to protect her from bad people like that. Later I find out the rape was a lie and just another example of how manipulative she can be. 


I stop all communication with her. I dont want anything of hers in my life. I'm done at this point. That was last week.


Now I found out she's fucking her friend from work from when we were together. 28 year old dude. I feel so jealous and betrayed since she told me they were just friends now matter how many times i said he wants in her pants. I need to get over these feelings...


Through our relationship I had caught her planning to cheat once (shouldve ended it there but was manipulated the way girls are so good at doing), lied to so many times about things such as if she was hanging out with guys or what she was doing. She also liked to post on gonewild no matter how many times I'd ask her not to. If we ever had a fight all I'd have to do was go to the front page of gw to see her new nudes she put up. She betrayed me and lied all the time. I never once did anything like this to her...


I just cant help but feel like I've lost something I can't live without. I hope at least someone reads this and gives me a heartfelt response. I imagine this looks so simple from a 3rd person perspective, but love is blind... What should I do?

23344,Breakups,1rvyth,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years. Things were great, we were always involved with each other's families, all of that. Everything was going great, even after we moved in with each other. Eventually we each got kind of bitter, started bickering because of silly home issues (cleaning/bills/etc), but we still got along and had fun. 

We had a fight around Halloween that almost led to a break-up, but decided to try again and work things out. Cue to today: we are putting up the Christmas tree, and an simple argument arises. Afterwards I ask him to sit down and ask what was wrong, and see if we can come to a compromise. He tells me he doesn't think he wants to try fixing the relationship and that he wants to break up. I'm sideswiped, but whatever.

The issue is that he is the one who pays the rent. I'm a student with an unpaid internship that's required for my degree. He's gracious enough to do this while I agreed to keep the house clean, take care of our animals, pay the utilities, Netflix, all of that jazz.  This was all agreed upon and had no issues besides the 'money is a little tight' stuff. 

The question is, what do I do? I can't move back in with my mother, it's almost impossible to get a job with my school/internship schedule, and I can't afford a place on my own. He did agree to continue paying the rent until he either finds a new job and moves away (He is living in my hometown, about an hour away from his) or I find a new place to stay. It's going to be AT LEAST a few months before I can even do anything. Thankfully he's kind enough to not throw me out. Has anyone gone through something like this before? What should I do?

edit: I don't want it to seem like I'm callous to the situation. I'm actually really upset, but I still have to worry about the 'adult' issues.

I'm trying to come to terms with his decision and all I can think of is how all the plans we made are gone, all the times we said we love each other mean nothing, all the laughs we had and tender moments were wasted on each other in a relationship that was apparently doomed.

23355,Dating,36o2rw,"I met her online a few months ago. We texted for a little while. She was a few hours away, but I was planning on transferring to her college prior to meeting her so it was worth a shot. Slowly we started texting more and more which led to skype and calls. We made a few attempts to meet but they didn't work out. She did talk about relationships and that she wanted one. Early on, but hey.

Finally I meet her. Everything transitioned to in person perfectly. We had sex on the first date. I don't think that night could've gone any better.

Things slowed down after. She wasn't as responsive. I texted her asking why and even asked if I should just forget her (overdramatic I know). This upset her and I apologized.

Week later and we were texting and I admitted that I had some feelings for her. Not over the top feelings, but that I was a little infatuated. She said it was very early but okay. Kinda felt bad about it after.

She still shows signs of interest through all of this by texting first and the like, however, I did make an attempt to see her about a week later and she apparently forgot she had a sorority mixer for the sorority she just got into. Oh well. I did visit her college as a college visit (due to me transferring there). I texted her when I was leaving. She was bummed to find out I was leaving and couldn't see her but I mentioned earlier in the week I was visiting and she told me she had another mixer.

Still through all this she shows signs of interest. However, in the last week or so not so much.

I called her out for being a tease this past weekend. She didn't take it well at all. She was surprised I called her that. Told her how I was really excited to meet her and was hopeful. She told me since I've seen her she underestimated her school workload, had suicidal thoughts, and also was kicked out of her house back in her hometown temporarily not to mention greek events, school, and everything else. However, things eventually simmered down and we texted the rest of the night to each other.

Since then I sent a text apologizing for sounding so blunt. She got back to it a few hours later saying she was busy at work. Conversation didn't continue as I fell asleep.

Also texted her yesterday but I think she was at work again. Her responses were short and took a while to get back to me.

23357,Dating,2z72ek,"We started talking on Tinder a couple weeks ago, have seen each other only 3 times. We ended up hooking up the 2nd time and after that we've been texting every day, getting to know each other, etc. We're in this gray area between friends with benefits and us trying to date each other. But it's really casual and chill. We're both just going with the flow because we don't really know each other yet.

Anyway, he's totally got his shit together. He already graduated and has a job related to his major that he enjoys. I'm in a different major that's somewhat related because it's in the same field. He's very knowledgeable about our field and is good at networking. I have absolutely no experience and I literally just started an internship 2 weeks ago. I also have zero professional references. I'm graduating in May he told me to start looking at job listings right now. He's offered to help me with my resume and interviews because that's something he's really good at. He tries to give me advice and also offered to help me get me an internship at the place he interned at.

I feel like I'm incredibly lucky to have him right now as someone to guide me through all this because honestly I'm completely clueless. I made a mistake by not building my resume before this. I am severely lacking in interpersonal communication, interviewing skills, and experience especially. I really appreciate that he's trying to help me out, it's very sweet, and I KNOW I should be taking him up on it. It's just that we barely know each other and I don't feel comfortable showing him how inexperienced I am. On a dating level, I see us as relatively equal, but on a professional level I feel intimidated.

I know I need someone like him in my life right now to push me and motivate me, but at the same time he shouldn't have to do that for me. I mean, he's not my boyfriend. And I guess I'm also afraid that he'll lose attraction for me and think less of me if I let him help me. He also told me that he's picky so that also makes me feel like once he gets to know me, he won't like me as much. 

Sorry if this is a weird question on this subreddit. I know it's more of a dating question but what he's trying to do for me is something a guy in a relationship would do for a girl, so that's why I'm posting here. I would just like to know how I can best approach this. Of course I want to take all the help I can get from him, but I'm afraid of asking dumb questions and him realizing that it would require a lot more time to help me than he anticipated. He's already really busy and when we hang out we like to relax because he has long weeks. I don't want to take away his chill days.

What should I do?
   
**tl;dr**: This guy I'm kinda seeing but that I barely know is offering to help me since I'm graduating soon. He intimidates me in a professional sense and our relationship/friendship is pretty casual so I feel weird taking help from him when he has no obligation to help me.

So I'm in the Army, I've been deployed to Afghanistan since February. I got the news last November and was super pumped, I was gonna go home on leave in December, party my ass, off deploy for 9 months and then get back just in time to start my discharge. Perfect, right? Nopeeee, New Years Eve I get introduced to a girl and fall HARD for her. I've always been against getting into relationships while you're young (I'm 22) but damn, this girl was awesome. Anyways our short time together ends which was a bummer but I spent every night with her and came back for a couple more 4 day weekends before we were deployed, I think in total we spent 12 days together before I deployed but I was crazy about this girl. 
 
   We had started calling each other our secret gf/bf cause it was ridiculous to think that we were actually in a relationship after being together for such a short time but we agreed that we would wait for each other until I got back. We communicated constantly, Skype, text, phone you name it we did a damn good job of staying in touch and in April I said fuck it and asked her to be my legit GF which looking back on it was such a stupid thing to do but I was afraid of losing her and I fucked up. She got a new job at a hooters-esque type place which I was cool with and she started making a ton of money which was awesome for her. In May she started going out drinking after work with her co workers a lot which is whatever but it turned into staying out super late and not answering texts, phone calls. 
     
  I started suspecting something was going on and looking back the signs were just slapping me in the face, I just didn't want to believe it. I started doing some snooping, which I'm not proud of, and found some disconcerting things but no hard proof she was cheating on me. Fast forward through the summer filled fights and her swearing nothing was going on. At the end of August I saw a Facebook message conversation she was having which pretty much confirmed everything I had thought all along, I confronted her and she denied it at first but finally bit by bit admitted to having sex with a guy multiple times over the summer. It absolutely crushed me, that coupled wight the fact that one of our guys got killed not even a week later has really just taken me out of it. I stopped talking to her for a while but eventually decided to talk to her and just empty everything out, after a week of fighting, crying and talking I decided I would give her another chance.
   
  What we had was more of a fantasy than real life, I still can't believe I rushed into a relationship with her after only being with her for 12 days, that was a mistake but what’s done is done. I look forward to coming home in a few weeks and giving us an actual shot at a real relationship, but still my mind sometimes slips to thoughts of her with that other guy and it just kills me. I know I’m all over the place right now, and I’m sorry I just can’t keep a train of thought right now. I am a real confused individual at the moment. I just want to know if I'm crazy for giving this another shot??

23366,Dating,2hjlwc,"About 5 months ago I was staying in Chicago for a few weeks. My friend, Amy, came and visited me during a weekend. While she was here, she said she had plans to meet up with a man she used to work with in LA, but he now works in Chicago. They had been talking/texting/emailing a bit, and since she broke up with her boyfriend of 5 years, he was the first person she's been interested in.

Kevin meets up with us one night, and we all get along great. I'm a little shy at first, since they both know each other quite well, but we end up engaging in several interesting discussions. I realize my friend may have feelings for him, so I'm doing my best to be completely neutral, flatter her, and still seem social. Kevin and Amy are even holding hands at one point. It was adorable. On the walk back towards my apartment, we're all chatting and I say some sort of joke, and he simply says a genuine, you're really cool. It was nice. I go into my apartment and Amy stays outside and helps Kevin find a cab home. She comes back and I tell her that he is so interesting and pleasant, I understand where she's coming from. 

The next couple of days, Amy tries to contact him to meet up, but he is being wishy-washy, so she and I end up spending more time together and everything is fine. She's an awesome person. She makes a Twitter account while in Chicago, and weirdly enough, he follows her, follows me, then unfollows her. I didn't really understand it, but that was that. He would occasionally reply to a tweet of mine, but again, I didn't think too much of it, and would let Amy know. I move back home to Boston, and continue living my life here, without giving much thought to the whole Amy/Kevin situation, apart from some words of wisdom for when Amy is feeling down about getting over him.

A couple of months ago, I'm on facebook. I normally have my account deactivated, but was online doing some creeping with a friend. In the 10 minutes I was on facebook before deactivating again, Kevin sends me a friend request. I thought it was quite the coincidence, deactivated, then sent him a twitter message, saying I'm normally not on facebook but I hope he's been well. We have a pleasant back and forth on twitter, during which I decide, why not, I'll just send him my phone number since I was enjoying talking to him. Amy hadn't talked about him all summer, and I think he's a person I would love to get to know. 

So we begin having conversations via text incredibly frequently. We have an incredible amount in common, and talking to him comes very easily. After this was occurring for a few weeks, I get a message from Amy about Kevin, saying she saw a status update and freaked out, realizing she wasn't over him. I decide to test the waters a little, and tell her that he sometimes to replies to things I tweet, and ask if she still wants to know of these types of things. She responds with an enthusiastic yes, so I tell her the truth, that I've actually been communicating with Kevin a lot, and there's a good chance we're interested in each other (at this point, he had discussed me meeting his parents and taking me to his hometown, which was a little strange but sweet). She isn't very happy, and we haven't talked since.

This past weekend, Kevin and I were texting, and as our conversations have been during the past few weeks, the vibe gets quite sexual. I initially expressed some discomfort, but I've begun to think it's pretty fun and addictive. At one point, I decide to bring up our difference in age (mostly because he often states that he's old). He said something along the lines of if you fuck good, nothing else matters. I get a bit offended, tell him I'm not an object, he asks if it makes him creepy for talking about sex so much, and I say no. The next day, I send him a pretty lengthy email where I discuss various events of sexual assault and situations where I never fully trust men, all culminating with me declaring that I've never actually had sex. And there was no real question posed at the end of the email. I just said I would get it if he can't really understand where I'm coming from. He responded with clarifying a few things, but said he'd get back to me when he has time to thoughtfully respond. I told him to take his time. 

The next day, I get a text from Amy, who I haven't talked to since telling her about Kevin and I, and she asks if there's something I would like to say to her. Kevin was in LA last week for work, and I had an inkling that he met up with Amy, but I never asked and he didn't mention anything apart from work stuff. I told her that I'd give her a call, but even I don't understand what's going on, especially since I'm still waiting on Kevin to think things over. We're planning on talking sometime this weekend.

My question to you all is, am I in the wrong? Amy and Kevin were interested in each other, he didn't exactly reciprocate when she was in Chicago, and then I spend an evening with the both of them and this whole situation came to be. When he and I first started texting, it was a friendly vibe, and I wasn't trying to necessarily attract him, mostly because of fact that I didn't know what him and Amy were, and I was in Boston and he was in Chicago-none of it made a lot of sense. 

When I talk to Amy, how much should I disclose? Does it make sense to assume that they saw each other when he was in LA, or that they still remain in contact, despite the fact that she stated that they don't talk at all anymore when I spoke to her last?

And does pursuing a relationship with him even make sense? We're far away, I'm focusing on starting my career which may take me to Chicago, but sometimes conversing with him takes hours at a time, and I can't balance handling feelings and focusing on work. Also, since this is kind of a long distance talking relationship, does that even make it worth it? He is incredible, in so many ways. As I'm getting to know him, I don't dislike a single thing about him. But I realize that spending actual time together in person could be completely different than what it has been. I am leaning towards putting the whole thing on a pause until a real relationship seems possible. Planning imaginary dates doesn't really mean anything.

She says I put her through the ringer by making her make a decision between trying to make us work or losing me from her life forever. She now thinks that I was just bluffing and being manipulative.

Anyways story time:

My girlfriend and I had dated for about a year, to be completely honest I was not really in love with her but I felt a strong attachment and sense of loyalty to her and I stayed in the relationship with her because of that.

My girlfriend was addicted to League of Legends, but she was the type of gamer that would only stick to one game, something they knew because anything new or different was so foreign to them they would shut it out. However this poured into so many aspects of her life it was getting out of control.

I met her about 4 months after she dropped out of college for the second time through mutual friends, her reason for the second time is that she just wanted a break and picked up an office job. I was always supportive of whatever she wanted to do, but pretty soon she hated her job and realized that if she finished college that she would get a much better job that she would be happier in. But I never realized how lazy she was to change situation no matter how much I asked her to send emails or call or just get involved with the process of going back to school because that's what she said she wanted.

Instead she would come home from a long day at work, play league until 2am, maybe say a few words to me and say goodnight and then go to sleep and wake up the next day rinse repeat. Some days we would hang out after work but that usually meant that she would fall asleep straight after dinner and just nap and then ask to be taken home. It was frustrating but I put up with it, because I would confront her about it and she said she would try harder.

I would try to play league with her but because she would yell and berate me for not doing well or others not doing well I decided I couldn't stand how much she raged. And any other game I played with her, she would usually drop after an hour of playtime in a session to go back to her friends playing league.

This was all very frustrating to me because I spent time with her (hanging out once a week after work and maybe lunch on the weekend), and she didn't even text me back when she was in her long playing sessions (pretty much straight from after work until 1 or 2 AM).

About 2 months ago, my dad had a pretty bad surgery and ended up having to stay in the hospital for 3 weeks which was a very slow painful recovery process. During that three weeks my mom stood by his bedside, slept in chairs at the office and would frequently be overcome with worry about his health (it was pretty scary but the after the botched surgery he ended up in Stanford hospital so I was sure he was in good hands), so after work (typical office hours 9-5 but I would leave earlier around 4 during the time he was in the hospital) I would go the the hospital and relieve my mom so she could go home, shower, eat, whatever she needed to do and she refused to sleep at home. My ex-girlfriend not once visited my parents, or even talked to me while I sat in the hospital with my dad (he was usually asleep) through text during the daily 5 hours I was there. It was grueling, lonely, and even when I was on a date with her and my mom asked me to pick something up from the hospital to take home, she elected to go home and cancel the date. When I asked her to come along she stayed in the car but she refused to go down into the hospital to see him, so my mom came out of the hospital to give me the things that she wanted to be taken home.

Anyways she broke up with me 3 weeks ago and our mutual friend has expressed a lot of anger towards her, in light of how many family matters I had to go through and my ex giving other guys special treatment. In fact she is pretty flirty with this guy who she met through our mutual friend League stream, he's a player on my university's League team and he's also 19. He has a girlfriend but my ex has been rocking the boat and he would commonly go to our mutual friend and pretty much confess his infatuation with her. And it is mutual, my friend wouldn't tell me the details (out of concern for me) but that's all I know about it other than she pretty much started out trying to get him in private skype calls and play with him all the time. And my mutual friend would get angry at that time because she knew that my ex wasn't giving me anything close to that same sort of attention.

Honestly I've been quite civil, I politely talk to her occasionally only once I tried to ask about our relationship after we broke up. She would send me music videos and funny or cute pictures (as we used to do when we were going out, pretty much our main form of communication if it wasn't face to face) but since the last time I talked to her, she said she didn't think we should talk.

The only reason I'm posting on here is, I need help. I need someone to help me understand this void I'm feeling, I'm not very angry, I'm barely jealous, I'm not sad to the point I can't do anything else but think about her. I just feel so restless and unsure of what this means in my life, or if I'm just not feeling anything right now since I still have to take care of my parents. I just wish I knew how I should be feeling, maybe what I really want is closure, or confrontation but I can't really get that if she isn't responding to me. She's removed me from her league of legends friends list but not steam, skype, gchat or facebook so I'm not sure why (maybe because she knows that I only logged into league to see if she was playing or not, as the cause of her ignoring me and dropping our conversations) it happened that way.

Should I be considering writing her an email? I do wish her the best, I was really hoping that she would talk to me because I want to see her go back to college and get her degree and find a better job because after this summer, I understand what a soul-crushing job is and how it sucks the motivation out of you. 

Or maybe I should be more confrontational about the way she is acting around this 19-year old guy, who she knows is infatuated with her(and she might/probably reciprocates) and he has a girlfriend who he is serious with. And tell her to get her act together. And it hurts because she has so few irl friends that I'm afraid if she ever realized she needed help, she would not find anyone willing to support her. I've asked our mutual friend to remain close to her even if she dumped me for good, but it seems like she can't take it anymore because of her whatever-relationship with that 19 year old guy.

I guess, finally I hope people have some tips for me to get over someone. I know it's stupid, she treated me like shit, but I still feel attached for her and wish her the best. I wish I could have known more details but as I said my friend didn't want me to know everything.

So if you've stayed with me this far... how should I be feeling? Because I have no idea how I am right now.

23373,Breakups,23sqra,"I've posted on here before but this is somewhat of a different situation so I'm making a different post.

First part of the story I'll make short: We dated for almost 5 years and were so in love with each other however we were young, naive, both made mistakes that hurt each other, relationship grew to become mentally, physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive. Most of the abuse was coming from the male. I did do some abusive things to him and I will admit that, but it all stemmed from issues that he had with himself that were carried over to me. 

Currently: My ex-boyfriend is seeing a new girl. We still talk from time to time because we can't seem to stay away from each other... but he told me he truly has strong feelings for this girl. This girl has strong feelings for her ex boyfriend. He is fighting for this girl because he really likes her and she makes him 'happy'. He will text me from time to time and tell me that he misses me and that he still wants me in his life as a friend, not as a lover right now. I told him that I simply cannot be just a friend.

 It kills me every second of the day to know that he has feelings for another girl. I've tried over and over with other men but I feel as if I literally cannot feeling anything for anyone other than him. I truly have tried. I really, really, really, really love my ex-boyfriend, but he doesn't believe me because we've been through so much and I am mentally and emotionally drained and I can't keep on with the metal torture.

He tells me that he doesn't love me anymore, but then he tells me that if I really loved him, I would try and fight for him to choose me over this other girl. He compares this to how he is fighting for her because he really likes her, since she still talks to her ex boyfriend as well. I explained to him that no one deserves to be treated like an option, not me, not him. i don't deserve to be his second option, and he doesn't deserve to be this other girls second option.

 And then when I tell him I am not going to fight for him with another girl, he gets mad. Calls me pathetic, and tells me all I do is give up. Isn't love letting the person you love be happy? Isn't love letting go of the person you love? He makes me feel really confused and stupid. It isn't fair to me to be with him in his bed one night and then the next night he is in this other girl's bed. I personally think it's selfish. When I tell him it isn't fair and that I want to walk away because I'm not strong enough to handle the situation, he calls me a coward and says I don't really love him. He says that I should be making him love me again - but I told him that if I'm making him love me, then that isn't real love. He should love me because HE wants to and because he truly DOES, not because I want him to.

Also, when I tell him that I would still be with him, he asks me why and I'll say 'because I'm a fool. And he'll say something along the lines of well that answer just made me want to be with *other girl* even more.

 I don't even know if any of this makes any sense to anyone else but me. I feel really alone and I don't have anyone to talk to about this or relate to...

First of all, sorry about the length. I basically just spilled all my thoughts and feels and rationalization process onto this page. I am going through a really weird breakup and need some help. The breakup happened on Monday.  It came out of left field, and it was really like he did a 180 overnight, pretty much.  Prior to the breakup, we'd been talking about moving in together and we were both very excited at the prospect, I thought.  I mean, he explicitly told me how excited he was. He also had said within the past month that I was someone he could be with forever, and that I am the person he cares about most in the world. I thought we were moving forward.


Then, we had an argument (more of a discussion) because I was being insecure about my body. I was questioning his physical attractedness to me, because I had been feeling self-conscious. Instead of being able to reassure me, however, he seems to internalize my insecurities and think that it means something about himself (this has happened before). We spent the next night separate because I told him I needed some space, and he didn't want to hang out either. Then after work the next day I went over to his house to talk about why I was feeling insecure (his level of fitness is greater than mine--he's an avid runner--but I am by no means unfit), expecting that we were both committed and that this argument would be a bump in the road. I was wrong.


After I told him about why I thought I was feeling insecure, he said he had more to tell me.  I am not a weed smoker (I get paranoid) and a couple months ago he chose to stop smoking weed as much as he had been because he wanted to be closer to me and didn't want that to be a barrier. I told him that wasn't necessary but he said he wanted to do it for himself, too. Apparently he's been smoking weed and hiding it from me for the past month.  That was like a slap in the face, especially because this was a self-imposed rule and I was kind of ambivalent about it. Additionally, my cigarette smoking made him uncomfortable, so I stopped. I never really smoked real cigarettes very much, mostly ecigs (that's how I got addicted--don't do it!), but I didn't want to be addicted to something and he didn't like it either, and that was the extra motivation I needed. I did smoke some ecigs during my mad scramble at the end of my first semester in grad school, and I'd sometimes have a cigarette with friends while drinking, but I'd tell him about it.  When he told me he'd been lying, I reacted badly.  I said things like I can't believe you....you aren't trustworthy after all...why did you ever tell me you'd stop?....I knew this would happen.  I have trust issues from past relationships and probably from my parents as well, and he knows all about it.  I even sensed he was high one time when he came over (and I found out during this convo that he was), but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to be distrustful.  So I try to manage my trust issues by not reacting on it, but I am not sure if that is the right way to manage it.


He said that its a big red flag that he felt the need to lie to me about it, and I agree. He also went on about his feelings changing, having a gut feeling that he needs to be alone, and that there are more things he needs to learn, and he needs to learn them alone.  Honestly, I knew he had committment issues that he was trying to work through very early on, and I thought that I could help him grow out of it.  /facepalm  Oh, and he also was saying that maybe he isn't physically attracted to me enough, but he doesn't know. He has never been with someone as fit as he is, so he isn't sure if he would be more attracted to that kind of person, but that the biggest draw for him to me was my personality. And that's good, I want to be with someone who is more attracted to my personality than my body. He said, however, that he thinks I should be with someone who appreciates all of me more. It almost seems to me like he is punishing himself for lying to me by breaking up with me. Which, I guess, might be exactly the right thing to do. Not the punishing part, but the breaking up part because it isn't fair to me to be treated like that, and could be signifying some deeper issues he has, which is what he thinks it signifies.


Thinking about it, I pretty much knew this would happen because I feared it would. I was afraid that he'd eventually leave because he has this romanticized idea of being alone. I ignored it, and I shouldn't have, because what I really wanted was a long term committed relationship.  But I guess I just thought that I had to know more about how our relationship would go before being ready to leave.  He is also a very insecure person, it seems, and doesn't know himself well enough to know what he wants. Essentially, he does have a lot more learning to do and needs to grow up a bit. 

The biggest thing for me is that we had all these plans for our future that aren't going to happen now. I was going to move out to the west coast with him when I finished grad school, but now the idea of moving alone seems so daunting. But I can't stay where I am--most of the people I know and love have moved away. I actually started at the school I am at because I didn't want to move away from him for school, so I am stuck here for another year unless I want to drop out and/or transfer. He was my outdoorsy friend, and now I have no one to go camping, hiking, and snowboarding with. I also am sick at the prospect of dating again. I hate the games, the uncertainty, and it's so hard to find someone I really like. I also lost most of my friend group that he is a part of due to different issues, so now that I am not dating him, I feel like there is no doubt that I will never be included.  I have other friends, and my sister lives walking distance away, so that is helpful. But it still sucks to know that my roommate and her boyfriend will be going over and hanging out with him and his roommate and I won't be there.


And even though I have such a bleak outlook right now, I almost feel nothing. I really want to feel something and to cry and to start moving forward, but nothing makes me cry. I cried a little while the breakup happened, and he was blubbering the whole time, but since then I haven't cried at all. I feel like I am in a stupor and I can't think about anything else, but I feel like I have rationalized it all and that this was probably the right thing to have happened. I know myself pretty well and know what I want, and I don't want someone who is so unsure of everything (among other things). But I also told him I didn't know how I would feel after a few weeks of no-contact, but that if he decides this may have been the wrong decision, to talk to me about it. 


I am going through a very boring rollercoaster of emotions. I miss him, but don't at the same time. It's like the roller coaster goes up about a foot, and then comes back down, but it's not really crazy at the moment.  I am not sure if I miss him or if I miss being loved. There are probably things about him specifically that I miss, but I did sometimes have thoughts about why I wanted him over anyone else, and wasn't exactly sure what he brought to the table. I feel like I have decided that if he did come back, I won't take him, but I am not sure if this is just a defense mechanism or if I really feel like this.


It seemed like a great relationship though.  When we were together, things were awesome. We were super cute and snuggly and got along really well.  But apparently there was breakdowns in communication that just weren't addressed or even recognized. I guess I almost feel a sense of relief that it is over because I frequently felt taken for granted and unsure of where he stood. I put a lot more into it than he did, and I knew it. But how do I cry?  


TL;DR Boyfriend broke up with me out of left field when we hit a bump in the road and I thought we were committed.  Thinking about it, there were signs and I feel like I understand why this happened, but I feel kind of numb and I can't make myself cry. I am afraid this is hindering my healing process, so how do I stop feeling numb?

23380,Breakups,2d2l8m,"I met a girl who had just broken up with her boyfriend, and for a month, we hung out daily, and made out constantly. She talked about things like being meant for each other, made excuses to see me, and we both reciprocated. I had many warnings from friends, and even her (about her mixed feelings), that this was probably a bad idea. Despite me intellectually knowing that we were not a good fit with each other, and being really skeptical the first week or two on whether I actually like this girl or am even attracted to her physically, I developed over time an intense physical attraction to her that's almost indescribable. I had been on many dates prior to this, but have rarely felt such strong physical attraction.


She decided she just needed a friend at the moment so she could get over her ex, but it was most probably from my smothering her by making many future plans too soon and ultimately pushing her away. I said that was fine, I totally understand and could completely handle just being friends and take it slow.


But even as just friends, I would get extreme anxiety from unanswered texts, want to know what she was doing, etc. It ultimately ended up with me making some accusations that were outlandish and untrue, but in the moment I didn't realize that. I apologized profusely about it (and admitted I was terribly embarrassed - her friends probably think I'm crazy), she accepted the apology, and she and I decided we should probably take some space for a little while.


My problem is that she lives in the same neighborhood I'm in. So I run into her often. I know when she's home and when she's gone just by seeing out my window on whether her car is there or not. I still get a lump-in-throat feeling when I think about her meeting other guys, even though I know that's insanely stupid because she's never been my girlfriend. I've been able to not talk to her or text for a few days, but it's been horrifically depressing and anxiety provoking, to a degree that I know isn't normal. I worry about growing older and not being able to meet a girl like this again.


I know with 100% certainty that I have an irrational obsession with someone who is not even a good fit for me, and I need a way to get over it ASAP. I am seeing a therapist, but it's expensive and super slow.

I'm in an LDR with my boyfriend of 3.5 years. He's from the UK, I'm from the US.

A year or two back, we used to play WoW together and we got really close with our guild. We ended up having a little meet in one of the countries most of our guild mates were from and were planning on having a second one in a different country. This occured in '12.

In our guild there was this woman[36+/F] who was very flirty and open. She was also cheating on her live in boyfriend with a fellow guild mate[24/M].

I didn't know she talked to my boyfriend so much until after the first meetup when we all went back to our home countries. She did not make it to the meetup, but the next one was to be held in her home country. My boyfriend and I would stay on skype as much as possible if we were both home, so you can imagine conversation dimming down eventually. 

Things were starting to get stale and he started blowing me off and sometimes inviting *her* into our private calls. When we were on call, you could hear him typing and giggling enjoying whatever conversation he was having with whoever. He would then invite her in and all of a sudden go from a mute to full of laughter and joke(a lot of sexual jokes) and still completely ignore me. I told him I didn't appreciate her intrusion and he told me I was just jealous. I agreed because I was livid jealous. I couldn't stand her at this point.

A few months after he started inviting her into our calls, he came over to visit me for a couple months. I later find out he talks to her before he goes to bed(I live with my parents and they're pretty religious so we had to sleep in separate rooms while he visits here) and talks to her nonstop while I'm at work and typed to her while I was home. It bugged me and he'd stop when I told him to.

One night, we were chilling out together and he fell asleep while I was playing on his way better laptop like usual. He keeps his skype signed in and she just popped up in my mind and pissed me off.

I normally never pry. I believed everyone was entitled to their privacy, but the way they acted towards each other really started bothering me. He had some of her pictures saved on his computer. I opened his skype and read their last conversation which was only about a paragraph. It was talking about how he was still planning on going to the next guild meetup alone since I couldn't make it and he couldn't wait to see her. **He asked her if she would fall out of love with him.** He called her pet names like gorgeous and cutie never called her by her real name when he typed to her. He told her how good she looked. It destroyed me reading those few lines.

I didn't get to read the rest because I woke him up immediately with my freakout. He got annoyed and took his laptop back, deleted the message history, changed his password to his skype and his laptop. He said I was being paranoid, but who asks if a friend is going to fall out of love with him? Who calls their friends gorgeous and cutie? 

After a long circle jerk of a conversation, he started crying because he never considered what he did cheating but now that he saw my reaction he did. He said he didn't do anything but if he didn't why wouldn't he let me read the rest?

I feel like this was never settled. We ended up each crying ourselves to sleep and apologizing in the morning, but never talked about it again. She still fucking pops up in my head.

He asked me if I wanted him to delete her and I said yes, but I wasn't going to be *that girlfriend.* He deleted her. We no longer play WoW(he pops in every now and then, but I don't think she's there anymore) and the guild has fallen apart since then. Also, the second meetup didn't happen so he still hasn't met her. 

I want to do two things. I want to message her on facebook and ask her about it and I also want to bring it up again with my boyfriend.

My only problem is that it has been two years since this happened. I feel like the psycho paranoid girlfriend trying to stir shit, but I really just want some closure.

We're working towards moving in together and getting married. She's always in my head. He took an interest in learning her native language and when he says stuff in the language, it pisses me off. Anything related to her country annoys the crap out of me and reminds me of her and just brings this wall of emotions back to the surface. I just want to know what the extent of their relationship was and I wish I could just see for myself.

I love him to death, he's my best friend and we are 100% happy right now. This one thing is the only thing that is bugging me. 

Should I approach her about it after two years and how to I start up this conversation with my boyfriend?

I met a girl on a train ride home a week ago. It was a 2.5 hour ride and we talked throughout the entire trip. We talked about what we liked to do, music, our majors in college etc. At one point, I even got a hint of a flirt when I said you should make your own comic strips and she said That would be awesome. Would you read them? I replied with Of course! As long as they're funny (lol) And she followed up with Alright, I'll make sure to put those in there just for you.

At this point I was like alright I can definitely ask this girl for her number before she gets off. She lives not too far from me and we can just hang out. Seems like a decent individual. So before she got off at her stop I asked Hey would you want to hang out some time? Not even implying a date or anything. Honestly, just wanted to meet some new people to hang out with because I'm a transfer student and don't know too many people at school yet. She said Sure! so i gave her my phone, she punched in her number and left.

Unfortunately, it didn't pan out that way. About 2 days after the train ride I texted her saying Hey _____, its kbk2015! From the train ride! No response. This was about a week ago. I can assume its a lost cause, or she gave me a fluke number. She put her full name into my contacts, which leads me to believe she didn't put a fake number because I can easily look her up on FB and add her, but I didn't. I assumed that since I got no response, I wasn't welcome to chat again.

Any pointers from more seasoned social butterflies? Did it seem like I dropped the ball at any point? Feel free to ask me questions and I can elaborate further. I just want to be better prepared for next time. I know you can't win all of them.

23396,Breakups,1lyewc,"I have dated a beautiful and incredibly attractive girl at my school for 4 months. Although she is attractive, she wasn't what one might call a popular girl. However, I have been, throughout my high school career, always quite popular, and in my humble opinion, a rather good looking dude. She had a group of quite and secluded friends. Our relationship all started during the night of Prom and ended yesterday. During the so called honey moon phase/period it was wonderful. I often felt like the luckiest guy at our school. While dating me, she made new friends much more popular then her usual friends and was escalated to almost a celebrity status at our school. We could talk about anything practically and enjoyed ourselves during summer.

But there was a significant change in her when school started (a month ago). When I would walk her she seemed rather zoned-out and reluctant to communicate with me. When we would have conversations (if they could be called conversations), I was usually the only one talking with her making a few interjections huh, okay, i dont know, here and there. It got to the point that I felt like I was the only one trying.

Furthermore, since school started I've been hearing rather uncomfortable things from my friends about my gf. A mutual friend told me that my gf was only keeping me around to win HC Royalty and Ball Royalty (which we would have easily won). Another friend told me that she had lost emotional attraction to me (and virtually hated our conversations), and was only attracted to me physically. Despite these things, I kept trying to make our relationship better. Hell, I took her out to a $100 dinner (This is a big spending for me a HS student without a job) to talk things out. I distinctly remember her saying I still like you as much as when we started out and I was reassured.

But things didn't change and I was forced to do more than I wanted to. Yesterday at lunch I sat her down and asked her a couple of questions and begged that she answer with complete honesty. I asked her if she was dating me because she still liked me or just because for the sake of being in one. After a seemingly very long pause, she answered I still like you, but not nearly as much as I used to. So I think I'm dating you just for the sake of being in a relationship. Needless to say, as someone who still liked her as much as the first date, this answer was a punch to the heart. I told her that I will be forced to think about breaking up with her as I was an honest guy and I did not want a 'superficial relationship'. To this she replied It's not that bad right? We could still keep things going even if I don't like you anymore. At this point, I realized that while I was rather depressed and frustrated, she was nonchalant and indifferent in this entire conversation. She even smiled a couple times when answering my questions. I told her I needed a day to think about our relationship and that she could go hang out with her friends for the remainder of lunch.

I thought long and hard for about 3 hours and decided that that was all the time I needed to decide. After school I broke up with her on a very good note (or what it seemed like so). I said something along the lines of [name] 2 periods were all I needed to decide. Let's end things here. It's been a fun 4 months and I hope you find a much better guy than me. All she said was That's it? Ok she smiled , without a hint of sorrow or anything of that sort, and left. 

I told myself I had done a good thing, that I had ended things before things got any worse for me and before I was really hurt by the one-sidedness of our relationship. I realized that what my friends said were probably true. She most likely kept the relationship going, even though she didnt like me, to win Homecoming Royalty which is about 4 weeks from now.

Flash forward to today. I feel hollow. I know I had done the right thing, but I keep having this thought that I should have tried harder to fix things, that I should have kept things going for some more time. Maybe I should have gone through the homecoming royalty ceremony with her. Maybe that would have changed her mind.

I can't figure out whether what I did was premature.

tl;dr: Broke up with my girlfriend of 4 months because she was no longer attracted to me but wanted to keep the relationship going (I didn't like the sound of that). She wanted to keep me for HC Royalty and Ball Royalty. I hate superficial relationships. Was it premature? Should I have tried harder to fix things?

I replied with a We will not go to HC together to which she replied Are you going with someone?.

23397,Breakups,1zaflo,"A little back story: My girlfriend and I had been dating since freshman year of High School. During this time, we have broken up twice. The first time being when I was accepted to a major private university on an academic scholarship while she barely made it into a generic 4 year program (at the time, this university was considered a step up from a local community college. Not so much the case now.). She lashed out that I would be selfish enough to choose the school I worked so hard for over her. In the mean time, my grandfather passed away. With his passing, she never once expressed her condolences to me or my family. Although I was angry at her, I was able to move passed it as I approached my freshman orientation. The first two months of my freshman year were riddled with constant suggestions that I was sleeping around, even though I wasn't. The fact of the matter is, I actually made friends. In High School, she alienated me from all of my football buddies (except the ones she approved of). These are people I had known forever, but was suddenly unable to spend time with them. Now she didn't have that power, and instantly grew jealous. So I finally had enough. We broke up that October. I started seeing someone new around December, and she started dating a good friend of mine from back home. We got back together around May, after I told her I'd do I can to make her happy. 

The second time we broke up was bad. I caught her going on a date with someone while we were together. Essentially, she left her facebook logged on to my laptop one day and the guy instant messaged her say he had a really great time the other day and would love to take her out again. I instantly blew up. We got into a huge fight where she blamed me for her infidelity. I demanded the only I wanted from her: the promise ring I got her from High School. Promise rings are dumb, I get that. It was the only tangible thing I directly gave that I could take away. So in a fit of immature rage, I demanded she give it back. She did, we broke up, and she continued seeing this guy and all of his friends. At this time I'm pretty angry at everything. Then one day she calls me and says she's sorry and wants to try and work things out. I agree, but her one stipulation is that she wants to start trying for a baby. Now at this time, I'm pretty distraught and agree to everything. We start trying, and now have a beautiful baby boy. (Not the greatest conception story, but it's what I got). 

Fast forward to now. The last few months have been pretty rough. We've fought off and on almost everyday. That is until Valentine's Day (our anniversary is two weeks later btw). I told her a week ahead of time, that I am strapped for cash trying to pay off medical, car, and normal baby needs so we will not be doing anything for V-Day. She agreed, said she understood, and I thought everything was honkey-dorey. Boy was I wrong. She brought the weight of her entire family down on me, saying how shitty it was that I didn't do anything. We get into this huge fight about it that ultimately persists for two weeks. Well two nights ago everything came out in the wash. We agreed mutually to separate and share custody of our son. Now I don't know what to do. Through out all of this, I still love her. I want to be with her. I don't know if it's some arbitrary need for consistency, or if I'm a glutton for pain. All I can say, is that I'm not going to expose my son to this on/off life style. It's either we're together, or not. 

So I don't know what to do. Nine years is almost half my life. I haven't dated anybody in forever and now I have a son that deserves every ounce of love I can give him. The shitty part is, I don't see him that much as is. I work everyday including weekends at a job I'm hoping to move up in. It's not much, but it gets us by and I'm more than willing to sacrifice for him. What would you do in my situation? Do you try and make things work or do you move on? How do you move on?

23399,Dating,2pzac7,"About a month and a half ago, I met this girl on Tinder. I was the first guy she'd met on there, and subsequently the last. We see each other all the time, and unless I work early I usually sleep over at her place. We had the exclusive talk after about two weeks, but we're not going to put a label on the relationship just yet. 

She seems to be a little insecure, though she tries her damndest to make me think otherwise. She'll say stuff like I'm really not the jealous type, I'm really independent, I get bored of guys quickly, etc. Yet one night, we were playing drinking games with her roommates, and when we went to bed she freaked out because an old friend of mine from the 3rd grade (who happens to be a girl) was in my top friends on snapchat that week. I can tell she worries about me seeing other girls and that. She also likes to shit-test me with jokes about a guy who was bugging her on Tinder when we first started dating, or tries to get me going by saying she made out with a guy at the bar, or we should stop seeing each other, etc. At first I played along and found it funny, and did it to her too, but it's getting a bit tedious and annoying. 

Anyway, Thursday she left for home which is about 4 hours away, and she'll be there for 3 weeks until Uni starts again. Almost all of her friends live there, including a lot of guy friends who she hangs out with regularly. We snapchat each other a lot, and we'd been calling each other on Skype before bed. A few weeks ago, she went home for a weekend, went out, and told me about one of her guy friends who tried to kiss her. Last night, we both went out, and she told me this guy (who apparently has a girlfriend) was going to be there, so she didn't want to go.

Well, she ended up going anyway. She stopped snapping me for a while, and during that time I went home and went to bed. This morning, I wake up to 10 snaps from her, saying stuff like Are you still up I'm sorry, among other random drunken nonsense. In two of the snaps, the latter being at 6 AM, there was a guy who I hadn't seen before (though I think it may have been one of her friends she's talked to me about once, and he has a girlfriend). Also, I think it may actually be the guy who tried to kiss her.

Even if nothing happened, or he has a girlfriend or whatever, am I wrong for being cheesed about the fact she was with this guy until 6 AM and actually sent me snaps with him? I don't feel like we've built enough trust yet for her to be playing these sorts of games, but I don't want to seem like clingy or possessive if I let her know it bothers me, especially given the fact she's only just left and we have 3 more weeks of being apart. So, not too sure what to make of the whole situation and I could use some advice. Thanks in advance.

Some back story:

&gt;2009, I'm hanging out with some friends. We're drinking and doing the usual guy thing when one of them jumps up and practically yells, Lets go to the strip club! 

&gt;I was extremely uncomfortable with this idea but everyone else was extremely excited. Now, normally my friends are a really understanding bunch of guys but, since we'd been drinking and I couldn't come up with a reason why I didn't want to go(other than I hate strip clubs), they ragged on me until I agreed. 

&gt;After about an hour playing pool in the club I'm really not enjoying myself and its obvious. I then receive a text message from a friend inviting me to a birthday party for a mutual acquaintance and I see my way out. I make an excuse and leave. The minute I walk in the door at my friends house, I spot her. This really pretty girl with the most amazing smile I've ever seen. I grab a beer and make my rounds to my friends till I end up next to her. I introduce myself and we start talking. Now, I am in no way a suave guy. I am very shy and extremely awkward in social situations, that being said, it was like I was a different person talking to her. Everything came so easy and it seemed natural. Within a very short amount of time we end up sitting on a couch talking for the entire night. When the party started winding down she realized that her friend she had come with, left without her. So I offered to give her a ride. We continue to talk through the drive and sit outside her house for an hour just talking. We exchange numbers and make a date for the following week.

&gt;First date is perfect. And I mean perfect. The kind of date you see in the movies. Completely lost in each other. Lasted almost 8 hours. Before we part ways, I kiss her goodnight. If this had been a movie, there would have been fireworks. Everything felt so right.

&gt;Fast forward 3 months. Everything has been like it was the day we met. No hint of what to come in the future. She leaves on a trip for two weeks. Hardest 2 weeks I've ever had.

&gt;When she returns, something has changed. She depressed, paranoid. Starts getting jealous of any girl that talks to me or makes eye contact with me. We begin to argue. Not a lot, or anything really major but enough to make me say, hey, what's going on here? A few months go by and things go back to relative normalcy. We still argue but what couple doesn't?

&gt;I'm happy. I'm head over heels in love with this woman. We spend every waking moment together. Since she basically lives with me, I ask her to fully move in. A month later, I lose my job and we're forced to move. That's when everything goes down hill.

&gt;Fast forward 2 months. The jealousy and paranoia has kicked into high gear. I'm not allowed to do anything without her there. We fight almost every day about the dumbest shit imaginable. I can't find a job so I'm lazy, even though I keep the house clean and cook. Since I'm not working and she can't keep track of my whereabouts, I'm cheating(we've completely stopped having sex at this point. The constant fighting has killed any desire to please her).
3 months later I finally find a job through one of my friends. Since this friend is female, we get into a fight and she tells me not to take the job. Even though we are struggling. We can't pay bills. I take the job anyway. I'm tired of being so broke I can't eat.

&gt;We now fight every day.

&gt;I'm miserable but I can't leave. I keep telling myself it'll get better, things will go back to the way they were. I start confiding in one of my coworkers. A girl around my age. Of course, my ex flips out which makes me want to spend time with my coworker even more.

&gt;She starts to convince me I'm in an abusive relationship but I'm lost. I don't know how to leave. I'm so broken down that I'd rather stay where I feel safe. I start developing feelings for this girl. She makes me feel like I matter. ( I understand now, that even though nothing physical happened, it's still a form of cheating). My ex finds out. Our fights becoming screaming matches. She's in my face and it takes every ounce of self control not to hit her( I need to note here that I am not a viloent person and it takes A LOT to get me angry, and even more to get my to the point where I'm going to hit you). 

&gt;It was at this point that I asked for help. With my parents support, I told her it was over and I moved out. I thought that was the end of it.

&gt;For the next 6 months she stalks me. Constantly texting me. Saying how much she loves me and she's sorry and we can make it work. If I don't answer her text, she calls over and over until I either pick up the phone or she shows up at my door. Eventually I break down, get back with her and move back in with her. Stupid I know. I just wanted it to stop.

&gt;After being back together for a month she decides it's over and I have to beg my previous roommate to let me move back in.
The time frame for all of this is approximately a year and half almost 2.

Now that you know my backstory here's my problem.

Im still in love with her. Completely head over heels in love. Ive had a new girlfriend for 2 years now but as much as I love her, I love my ex more. She's in my dreams and my thoughts constantly. 

I've managed to avoid seeing her around for 3 years but now I cant anymore. We now have a mutual friend and will be attending the same party in a week. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. I've been a wreck the past couple of weeks since I found out of my friend she was going. I keep having dreams about her. Every single day, whether it's a nap or I go to bed for the night, I dream about her and it's always the same theme. We talk, we apologize and we make up and kiss, leading to us getting back together.

I know this isn't possible and I know its not healthy. I tell myself this everyday when I wake up in tears when I realize I was just dreaming. These dreams and the stress of having to see her again soon has caused me to drink every night in the hopes that I'll just pass out and not dream of her.

What can I do?

23403,Breakups,2s0kiv,"I could post some lengthy thing about the breakup, but I think Ive recently realized that it boils down pretty simply. I think the more that I saw how things were developing and becoming more and more serious I just felt like I was in a relationship with someone that I didnt want to be with for the rest of my life. 

I ended things 3 months ago and have had a rough transition from having someone around all the time to not at all. She is very much still in love with me, and I definitely still have feelings for her (the thought of her with someone else still really gets to me), but I wouldnt label it as love anymore. 

Now the part making it hard on me; my ex and I still share an apartment until our lease is up in March, most of the time we work opposite schedules but it is a bit awkward and sometimes leads to her telling me about what can be different and asking me to give her another chance. She says that she loves me so much and it hurts her the most that I wont give it another try. My Dad and her have both told me that Im thinking too far ahead about parts of the relationship that arent currently relevant. I was taken back when my Dad told me this, maybe its his old school nature, but he sees how much she cares about me and thinks im throwing away what could be something big. But I feel like its unfair to give a person who is so hurt a second chance when my feelings are it could be good or even great right now but I dont feel like shes the person I want to be with 5 or 10 years down the road, maybe even 1 year. Thats the part I cant shake. We were together for 2 years, I know her fairly well, she is awesome, funny, hot, a bit of a controller and sometimes quick to anger but she is an awesome person. Even with all that though I dont see me being happy with her down the road, theres just something that makes me not want to be 30 and dating her, or have kids with her which came up a couple times (nothing serious just her telling me I would make a great dad and Ive made her think twice about not wanting kids). Nothing against her personally, it just doesnt feel right. But is that something that might change?

Ive been getting the If someone loves you that much you should see what can come of it angle from Dad and ex, but it seems selfish and like it could just cause more heartache to give someone a second chance when I see it working well short term but not long term. Im so lost. Is it selfish to see if something can work out when the other party is in love and I have fallen out of love? Should I focus on moving on and ignore my Dad and Ex's thoughts?

23412,Breakups,2x0ans,"tl;dr My dad might be aspie and has trouble reading people. He left my mom and me abruptly for people who aren't going to take care of him because he was convinced my mom is controlling him, and one woman has already convinced him to take out a $30k car loan to get her a car and (possibly) robbed his wallet multiple times. My mom is distraught and can't take care of herself now, and wants nothing else but him home. Is there anything we can do to bring him back?

-----------------------------------------------------

My dad displays symptoms of Aspergers and has a lot of trouble reading people who are willing to do him wrong. His parents never did much for him, but his dad hooked him up with my mom, who has a good heart, 28 years ago and after two years they got married and my mom worked to improve both of their situations, helping them get out of being flat broke and living in the ghetto to living in a middle-class suburb with enough money to buy good cars with cash for their two daughters (me and my sister) and also keep us from having to take out student loans to go to our (great) state university. 

Now, by working to improve, I mean she helped manage my dad's money when he was the sole breadwinner and worked when she could find something that either paid enough to cover childcare and still help have money left over or had a schedule that didn't require putting us in childcare. She had an education degree from Mexico, and was working on a Masters teaching cert at a US university when my dad's company had us move across the country to where there wasn't a good school nearby, and online schools didn't offer Spanish courses at the time, so she couldn't finish and without a teaching cert she couldn't get a solid job. 

Fast forward to two years ago, mom caught him texting a much younger woman at work, when he wouldn't even talk to her. A few months after that, she got mail suggesting he bought a brand new Ford Fusion for that woman. Around the same time, he started making all kinds of noise that she was controlling him, when all she was doing was trying to help him. Money started disappearing from their bank account, via ATM withdrawals from gas stations near his work and large purchases at Walmart, according to the monthly bank statements, and just like that, the money saved for my sister's car was gone, leaving her with my dad's junker that now has no AC for the 100 degree summers or heater for the 20-30 degree winters. My dad would also accuse my mother of stealing money from his wallet that she didn't even know he had because the bank statement hadn't come in yet to show that he'd made more withdrawals.

My mom started asking questions and he either told her it was nothing or said if you don't like it there is the door. After a year of that, I made the mistake one night of barging into one of their late night arguments that was keeping me up when I had an early exam the next morning and yelled things I probably shouldn't have. I went back to my room and a bit later there was a thud from their bedroom, and my mom screamed and I went to her to find her on the floor saying she couldn't move because her back got hurt. To this day I have no clear story whether he pushed her or she just tripped. Neither had a history of abuse, though over the year since the texts started, he developed a habit of saying she was hitting or pushing him when all she was doing was trying to give him a hug or kiss. But anyway, she ended up driving to the hospital to make sure she wasn't very badly hurt, but she wouldn't let me go with her since I had to be up early and it was probably 1AM at that point, and my dad decided she was faking it and went back to bed. 

The details are shady here too, but apparently despite my mother never accusing my dad of anything, the hospital called the police on him for abuse, having his contact information from my mom having surgery a couple of months prior, and after talking to the police, my dad didn't come home, finding a room to rent near his work and living there. For the first few months, he would come home and cut the grass and take care of bills and stuff, but that stopped in August when my mom broke down as he was leaving and ran after his car to keep him from leaving.

The entire time he's been gone, my mom has been going downhill, eating and sleeping less and less, crying for hours and hours. She's worried sick about him because he is eating less and less, started smoking and going out to bars to play poker every night of the week. He's maxed out their joint credit cards, pretty much ruining her work on improving their credit scores. We found out that the woman he bought a car for (though he isn't paying for the car, he took out a $30k car loan for it in his name) has actually been jailed for theft (so that's where the money that disappeared from his wallet went), and both she and a woman he's apparently with now are very stereotypical cholas (hispanic gang girls), with plenty of thug ex's who could take my dad out in a heartbeat. 

It's now just a few weeks shy of a year since my dad left, and my mom still insists on not moving on, because a) he needs her help even if he doesn't want it, and b) she's very religious and set on married for life. To his credit, my dad has only brought up divorce when we ask him to help take care of the house because a lot of stuff is in his name and we can't do anything without his permission. He splits his paychecks between what used to be their joint account and a new account he made so my mom can't track what he's doing, but he continues to take bits and pieces from their joint account even though he barely leaves enough for mortgage and bills, and the amount he takes for himself is plenty to cover his own rent, which covers all the bills at his place, and then some. 

He keeps telling us that my mom should just go to work to pay for everything herself, but she's at a point where she can barely take care of herself, much less the house and a job. She used to be the one I could count on for anything, always was on top of everything, and now she can't even function. Once my sister and I were both in college, she finally had the time to go back to school so she could get a job, but surgery and then everything my dad has done has gotten in her way and she has no money for school, and any job she can get won't last because of the breakdown she is having.

He acts like he knows he should just come home, but he's too stubborn to say that we're right. He doesn't answer the phone for me or my mom anymore because he kept letting slip that things weren't going well for him, worrying us more, and he doesn't want to talk about coming home. My mom thinks he needs a male voice of reason to keep him accountable since he has no one right now, and is considering talking to some coworkers of his that we trust about what he's doing, but I'm not sure that's a good solution. Is there something we can do to help him?","Me [22 F] dealing with my undiagnosed Aspie dad [48] leaving my mom [49] after 28 years, mom is distraught and trying to get him back because he can't take care of himself",0.0,False,5.0,8.0,1424798410.0,/r/relationships/comments/2x0ans/me_22_f_dealing_with_my_undiagnosed_aspie_dad_48/,Romantic
23414,Dating,2nkxz9,"I have been attracted to a girl since my hormones kicked in to like them early in high-school. At age 15 I joined her fencing club to spend more time with her and get to know her better (and get fitter to become more attractive to her).

 It worked in the way that we became close friends through the rest of high-school and found we have similar sense of humour.

However, I was very shy and never asked her on a date especially since I didn't want to risk her friendship which had become very important to me. I instead had another fairly short relationship with someone who became interested in me which ended badly and that I regret immensely. She also dated other people. 

Fast-forward to now and I have been studying at uni in another city for two years while she has stayed in our home city for her study. Over that time neither of us have been in a relationship, which when we talked we both attributed to being too busy and focused on other things to be fair on a partner at this point.

 In my case it is also due to the fact that I have not found anyone I enjoy spending time with nearly as much as her and who I can effortlessly talk to in my new city. 

We only occasionally chat online but whenever I take a trip home and see her we always pick up our friendship the same as before and I am reminded why I have been attracted to her for so long.

 I know being her long time friend who is also romantically interested in her makes me the stereotypical bad nice guy who would like something more when they have no right to, but that's just how I feel.

Anyway, I recently came back to my home city for the three month summer break for an internship. In the two weeks I have been here I have ditched a party to go talk alone with her under the stars and went camping with friends where we again left and talked alone. 

While we were alone at camping I also asked her if after I finished my degree in two years and neither of us were in a relationship, would she would like to go on a date me (in a nervous slightly jokingly manner), which she said yes to. 

After that night she texted that we should get drunk next week, which ended up being tonight at my house. There was never any mention of inviting anyone else and it ended up being just us.

We talked for about 5 hours while drinking with no hugely sexual topics but there were a couple of topics she brought up about relationships that lead to us talking about things we like and things that frustrate us with partners.

So my question is, am I reading into the past couple of weeks too much because a relationship with her is what I want? Or is there legitimately some reason for me to be hopeful of a relationship in future?

Hi r/relationships,

About 3-4 weeks ago, my boyfriend broke up with me stating that he felt like there were other things in his life he needed to work on before he could date anybody again (to preface, he also suffers from anxiety and panic attacks following a year or so of a deep depression. He takes Lexapro if that matters.), and that it wasn't fair for me to be with someone who couldn't 100% dedicate himself to the relationship. This came out of no where to me as our relationship was great. We've been each other's best friends for the last 4+ years and he told me all the time how this was the best relationship he's ever been in and that I'm the best friend he's ever had and the most important person in his life. He said he wanted to end things before it turned to resentment so that there would be a hope for some kind of relationship in the future, whether it be back together or as friends.


When I was packing up all my things to move out of his house the night of the break up, he kept crying and saying he was really sorry and he didn't understand why he felt like he needed to do this. All he knew for sure was that his anxiety and panic attacks had been getting much worse than usual and even though he could see himself happily with me forever, a voice in his head was telling him he needed to find out if he's capable of being happy on his own. He just kept sobbing and fell to the ground crying that I deserved someone better and that he's damaged goods. I asked him to honestly tell me if there's anything I did wrong or could've done differently, and he insisted there was nothing I did and that I'm perfect.


The first few days were absolutely unbearable for me. I talked to some mutual friends of ours and my close friends and the general consensus was to stop talking to him as much as possible. I told him that in order to heal, I would probably not be able to continue talking and being friendly, and he said he didn't want that at all, but he understood what I needed to do for myself. And yet, every time I checked my phone, I'd have at least 6 texts from him saying how sad and lonely he is or asking to see me or saying he thinks within a few months he'll know if this was the right decision or not and eventually followed by answer me/ guess you're ignoring me texts. Being so incredibly close to him for the last 4+ years, I would always give in and reply to his messages telling him about how upset I was and I just couldn't believe everything was over. He would say things like they might not be over - only time will tell... and other things that made me believe we'll get back together at some point.


No matter how many times I tell him we shouldn't talk right now, he still texts me all day with everyday shooting the breeze type conversations that we'd normally have, like Snapchatting me pictures at work or talking about how surprised he was at himself for getting just a burger at Wendy's with no fries. I've had at least 15 conversations with him about why it's not fair to me to be talking to him through this and why it's not fair to himself either, and every time he says he knows, but he doesn't want that because talking to me is the only thing that makes him feel better. This past week he mentioned something to me about feeling much less anxious now that we're broken up, but he feels so alone, much less motivated, lethargic and that he hasn't been eating. He seems just as equally confused by this as I am.


I was doing some research online recently and stumbled upon some articles about relationship OCD (rOCD). I sent him one yesterday and said something like I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I found this article and seeing as you're just as confused about all of this as I am, I just wanted to see if it resonates with you at all. He read it and replied that it made perfect sense to him - was him to a T - but he didn't agree with the way it made it sound like a disorder. To him, the way he sees how he over-analyzes and over-thinks every aspect of his relationship was different than how he viewed his anxiety disorder. He followed by saying Regardless, you shouldn't want to be with someone like that anyway. You should be happy. You deserve it. This is why I'll be alone forever. I'm not the kind of person who can be in a relationship forever. He seemed to not realize or want to accept that rOCD is a treatable thing with therapy (he's had bad therapy experiences when he was trying to get his anxiety under control).


As much as I agree with him that I deserve to be happy and I should want to be with someone who will love me forever, I simply cannot get over how broken my heart is right now. He is absolutely the most important person on this planet to me. I've never in my life met someone I was so uncontrollably drawn to and compatible with. Not talking to him is KILLING ME, but I'm somehow convinced that it will make him realize what not having me in his life is really like or that not having me isn't the change he had hoped for in his life, but at the same time if he's feeling less anxious without me, he might be overall happier that way.


I don't know what to do right now. Like I said, I'm absolutely broken over this whole thing. No matter how hard I try to focus on other things, at some point in the day the physical pain in my chest and stomach and the lump in my throat catch up to me and I break down in hysterical sobs.


Not talking to him is ripping me apart, but talking normally to him inevitably ends with me explaining why I'm hurt and how much I just don't understand this and I know that's not fair to him. And when that happens, he says he can't talk about it anymore so I tell him we just need to stop talking altogether, but within a few hours he'll text me something again. It's a horrible roller coaster. No matter what, I think he needs therapy for this or he will end up alone forever.


If anyone has read this much, thank you so incredibly much for just letting me get this all off my chest. I just don't know what to do. I don't want continue to give him the best of both worlds out of fear that he'll grow used to that, but he seems unable to accept when I'm not talking to him. I also want to be here for him because I can't imagine how difficult it must be to try and figure out what it is inside you that is causing this. Our relationship was so good and so strong that I can't imagine him being OK without me in his life, but again, he might view his lack of relationship anxiety as being better than having a great, loving companionship with his best friend.


**TL;DR:** Boyfriend ended things but couldn't really understand why he felt like he needed to do so. An article about relationship OCD resonated so much with both of us, but he didn't seem to be willing to accept that it's something treatable. How do I help both and/or either of us through this? Should I just try to move on? No matter how many times I tell him we shouldn't be talking so that he can have the space he asked for, and he says he understands, he texts me non-stop anyway as though he can't even help himself. I'm not ready to let go of the best friend I've ever had and it seems like he's not either. I really truly believe the relationship we had was so special and rare (and he agrees), so I'm having SUCH a hard time accepting this and trying to get over him and move on.


Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated.

23417,Dating,1n0k6u,"So I don't want to go into a long winded explanation but the guy (21M) I'm (30F) currently dating, I have known for about a year. We started out as friends. Only in the past few weeks did we transition into something romantic. He's cute, smart, and most importantly funny. He has never been in a relationship before so he's pretty much going into this blindly. I don't mind holding his hand during the way because I've had experience with dating someone for a few years that was inexperienced in the relationship department as well. 

The ultimate problem is this... He loves my personality, thinks I'm awesome, beautiful and all that but it bothers him that I am considerably shorter than him, that I am sensitive/emotional to things, and my age.  He tells me not to be so self conscious about these things but I can't help have that nagging feeling in the back of my head that things will not work out because of these three particular things. 

Now the whole sensitive/emotional thing I'm throwing out the window because I'm chalking it up to him not experiencing what being with a woman who is not a friend is like. I am more sensitive to certain jokes because the fact of the matter is... I am now his GF and some things just aren't appropriate any more to make a laughing matter. 

The rest (age and height) is something I obviously can't help. So basically, what do you guys think? Can this work out in the long run? I know he says not to make a big deal out of it but sh*t does happen and I'm trying to just protect myself here.

23418,Breakups,29vp3j,"In May of last year, I met a boy. Although this may seem quite unexciting and uneventful, meeting him was possibly the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

He had previously been in a relationship with a fellow classmate for over a year and three months. His ex-girlfriend was infuriated when she found out that we were speaking to one another-yet we didn't stop the communication.

In June, we began to officially date. Being with him was an entirely new experience for me. I had never had a boy swoon over me like he did. 

All throughout my high school career, I faced a lot of bullying for my looks and weight. I was known as the girl who couldn't get a boyfriend-and that had really affected me.

So I meet this funny, attractive, athletic, and overall great guy, so of course I'm infatuated beyond belief. When I was on my period, he brought me fruits and Vitamin C tablets and chocolate. He wrote me love notes and surprised me at work on a regular basis.

As most teenagers can relate to, the relationship quickly turned sexual. A month after we began dating, I went on a week vacation. 

The day I got back, he left for his own vacation for yet another week. During that week, I reevaluated what I wanted-and I didn't like the obsessive nature that he possessed. We had to be together all the time- we had to know where the other was at at all times. When he got back form his vacation, I expressed to him my doubts. Ten minutes later, I ended up losing my virginity to him. I felt tricked and foolish for allowing him literally into me. 

It all seemed to be too late for me to go back and end things. As per my religion, sex is sacred-I felt as though we now belonged to one another. 

School started in September (we're currently dating for three months). His ex-girlfriend still despised me and would constantly tweet insulting and rude comments about me and my boyfriend. I began to get angry with my boyfriend in the meantime. On multiple occasions, I caught him staring at his ex-girlfriend. I started this somewhat psycho phase of my life-I hated when he even looked at other girls. I oozed jealousy and was constantly getting mad at him.

In October, I had a miscarriage. Although I was grateful to not join a teen mom statistic, the entire thing really affected me. I bled for 52 days after the miscarriage, yet the worst part was literally flushing my first child down the toilet-and my boyfriend was completely unsupportive. He would praise God for the miracle miscarriage. 
By this time, we were only dating for approximately five months. 

Emotionally, I was beyond drained. The miscarriage had really freaked me out. Futhermore, I was becoming so sensitive with all things involving my boyfriend and his ex-girlfriend. While cleaning his room, I found photo albums filled with their pictures (casually laying on his desk), her jewelry, stuffed animals from her, cards and letter from her..all just lying around. I cried one day for six hours, breaking up with him in the process, because I was so unbelievably jealous about their entire relationship-it seemed so innocent and full of love.
In the meantime, I was VERY sexually active. I was having sex with him multiple times a day. For his birthday, he asked that we have sex. That's all. I became depressed-I felt as though I was only good for sex, and would often express that to him. He would shrug it off and convince me that he loved me with his whole heart.
We hung out every single day for the entire nine months we dated. 

In February, things began to crumble. Another pregnancy and STD scare forced my boyfriend to admit that he too had been sexually active with his ex-girlfriend, that of which he had lied to me and claimed to have never even touched her. In a rampant rage, he yelled at ME, telling me all the things he hated about me, which included being hypocritical, bossy, and unloving to him. I guess I had been, but they were all because I was jealous and wanted to believe that I was his first love, as he was mine.

We had gotten back together, but his words had already cut me deep. I broke up with him again, only to attempt to get back together.
Then my birthday came. 

While I was asleep on my birthday, he had taken off my pants and stuck his genitalia into my anus (sorry this is really weird and uncomfortable). I woke up to this-I was disturbed and confused and angry at him. He won't admit to it being rape-but I never consented o it. I will always believe he raped me.

I broke up with him, and in a matter of 3 days he had a new girlfriend. He refused to speak to me to talk things out and remain on civil terms. He began to bad talk me and tell everyone how crazy I am just like his ex-girlfriend. (This pissed me off because he promised me that he would never compare me to her).

We only dated nine months and broke up nearly five months ago, yet i can't seem to get over this boy. He never had many friends when we dated-now he has a whole crew of friends. His new girlfriend is always happy and giddy-which differs from me (he tells everyone I'm crazy and always angry). He started working out even more than before, and his body is spot-on. He's always out being social. His life has improved so much since we broke up- while mine has gotten worse. Still, everyone loves and adores him. He's Mr. Nice Guy at my school, while my new angry and irritable demeanor has caused me to lose many of mine.

I guess what confuses me is that he could claim for so long to be madly in love with me and say he could never move on easily after me-yet he did it, and he did it well. He played the I want to marry you card, and I fell for it.

I don't know how he could spend so much time with a person and then purely hate and despise them. I don't understand how he could ignore me, especially when I tried to reach out to him after the breakup. He would literally drive over traffic medians to avoid driving next to me. We broke up the second time and he completely wrote me out of his life-how come he's still apart of mine?

I'm sorry for this tangent, I'm just really hurt and depressed. After five months, I shouldn't care so much about someone who has directly told me that he doesn't care about me.

I need advice on how to get over it. I've thrown away everything,deleted everything, and cut off all communication. I know there the whole get a hobby! thing, but I do have hobbies and try to keep myself distracted but I'm always so nervous to see him or his girlfriend, because when I see them I always burst into tears (yes, even at school).

Is there advice for how to get over this breakup and go back to the happy person I was a year ago?

She comes back and everything seems to be fine except I'm getting this weird feeling of distance.  One day, she left her email open on my computer.  As I go to close it, I notice a thread with another guy Mark from her old job.  The quickview contains a message *HUG* I Miss you*.  I immediately clicked the email thread, and I see 40+ email thread of really long messages.  She and him are constantly saying I miss you, I am always thinking of you, I wish I was there.  All the emails are long threads (500~1000 words) talking about unrelated subjects like food, travels, personal philosophy, likes, music, dislikes. At the end of every email its Hug/I wish I could hug you in person/I miss you. And she always writes I am thinking of you.  At one point, she mentioned hiking with him where he carried her over some water and that she missed him holding her and she really liked watching the sunset with him.  He has said multiple times I really like you, you are very special, I have never felt this way about anyone before. With this context, what's appropriate?

I ask her about it, telling her I saw her email but lying about the fact that I read it.  She says its nothing and just an old coworker from her previous job that might like her.  She's keeping in contact because of his connections in the industry.

Weeks pass and I jokingly ask her about this guy again.  She pretends to at first not know who I was talking about, and then when I show her she's friends with him on Facebook, she says, oooh that guy.  Then when she's checking her email, I confront her and ask her to show me a recent thread with Mark.  She shows me a bit but then asks me to stop.  So I don't continue to pry but I ask her to tell Mark that she has a boyfriend.

That day, I managed to read another few emails. After my previous conversation with my girlfriend, the tone of the emails became more work focused and less I miss you.  However, there were still instances of I am thinking of you... I wish I was there.  She also apparently skyped him and sent him a photo of her. He sent her a photo as well and she described it as That was a really hot picture.

I am completely in love with this girl, and I think she still loves me alot as well.  She told me she'd completely stop talking to him if I asked her to, although she doesn't know that I know the specific content of the emails.

This Saturday was a tough night for me in many ways, but in other ways it was maybe a turning point in my life.  A bit of backstory:

In May 2012, I began working full-time while taking a break from my studies.  At the same time, she started a job where we would come into contact several times a day.  We started talking (she started talking to me) during smoke breaks and lunch hour and we started walking back home together (we lived a few blocks apart).  

There was a roadblock though; she had a boyfriend (on and off for 12 years).  That didn't seem to stop her.  She came over late one night and we drank and smoked together, talked about life and relationships (she was very unhappy in hers).  I'm a timid guy who never makes the first move, so I didn't do anything.  Got a text message later telling me that her panties were soaked.  Despite the fact that she had a boyfriend, I made an incredibly selfish and immoral decision to make my move.  I'm REALLY not proud of this. Took me about a week after the text to make my move, which was well received and that turned into sexting and eventually we got physical after a lot of anticipation on both sides.  I find out that she's been with about 40 guys (she's 32...and been in a relationship for 12 years?  She's a serial cheater).  But I ignore this huge red flag anyways and continue.  

Between September and December (inclusive), we go through the stages of puppy love.  We text each other constantly, say how much we love each other, have sex any time the opportunity arises and she tells me about her plans to move out so that we can be together.  The typical whirlwind romance.  I hadn't had anything approaching a girlfriend since the age of 18 (where my GF cheated on me ironically enough), so after 8 years it was amazing to feel loved and have someone attracted to me.  

Then, starting in January (2013) she started ditching me.  I either got a last second text with an outlandish or tired excuse (cat is sick/dying, got my period just now, etc...).  I can understand she couldn't come over any time she wanted because she still lived with this guy, but the frequency of her ditching was amazing.  Every week for 4-5 months.  The texting slowed down.  The messages were less loving and showed less attraction.  She stopped returning my affections and we stopped having sex.  I still love her deeply and want a relationship more than anything.

Some time in April, I leave my job to return to school.  We essentially stop seeing each other altogether and my texts and emails go unreturned for weeks at a time.  Of course, knowing how many men she's been with, my thoughts turn to shit.  I thought these things before April, but now it felt more and more certain that she had no interest in me sexually and had moved on to yet another guy.  Still hasn't moved out despite telling me she wanted to since October 2012.

Despite all signs pointing otherwise, I held out an irrational belief that she still might have been into me and that something was possible.  So finally, I get her to come over to meet me this past Saturday.  I was expecting her to jump on me when we first met and for us to have a torrid night and (excuse my pervy-ness) fuck all night like we used to.  Immediately, I noticed she keeps her distance both emotionally and physically.  I started off the night with my hands around her waist and rubbing her legs, looking at her lovingly.  She eventually talks about how she wants nothing to do with men, not only me but all men.  That she's all of a sudden not interested in sex at all.  It finally clicks in my stubborn mind that her avoidance over the last 10 months should have hit me.  I shouldn't have assumed that she was still into me the same way I was into her.  I ignored so much of the reality of the situation because I wanted SO BADLY to finally have someone love me and find me sexy.  It's what allowed me to pursue someone that was still technically in a relationship despite me KNOWING how wrong it is.

She mentioned that she just needed time and that maybe down the road a relationship could still happen.  I explained that I believed that to be impossible.  Two people don't go from what we felt in 2012, to not seeing each other at all then BACK to being like we were at first.

I'm a 26 year old guy who has little (to no) relationship experience and this hit me hard.  On one hand, it's nice to finally know the truth about what the situation really was.  The single biggest priority in my life was having a relationship with her.  That wasn't her biggest priority.  I thought she would come running into my arms and that she'd be as attracted to me as I was to her.  That was wrong.  Boy did it ever feel like SHIT to be turned down by her.  I feel so fucking unattractive physically, mentally and emotionally.  But at least I'm no longer deluding myself into thinking otherwise.  That part is sobering in a slightly good way, even if it's negative I at least know the truth.  She tells me that maybe one day things will change and that she still wants  to keep in touch.  I told her that I can't talk or see her ever again, as it will just be a reminder of my failure and embarrassment.

I'm sorry for the scatterbrained story, but it's nice to get all this off my chest if anything.

Also, I'd love some advice on how to move on from this and how, as a lovesick guy with basically no relationship experience, to try and find someone who wants the same thing I do;  to feel loved, to feel attractive, to help each other through the best and worst moments of our lives.  It's clear to me I've been falling for the wrong type of person.  I'm just so sick of being alone and feeling so unattractive and unwanted.  I'd appreciated any help or advice.

Sorry again for the horrible writing style and emo BS :P  If anyone has any questions or wants clarification, I'd be happy to go into detail or clear things up.  Thanks in advance for those who took the time to read my rambling.

23428,Dating,2ok10w,"I'm in a bit of a situation and I don't know what to do.

My friend Jericho and I meet this girl Gloria at a party about half a year ago. Very attractive and cool. Gloria and I have notable chemistry but at the time, I had a girlfriend. Jericho says he's going to go for her, and of course I don't care. They go on a couple of dates but nothing comes of it. When I consult him about it, he swears he's done with Gloria and is moving on.

Fast forward to September. I'm single now. On a night out, Jericho is heavily making out with a girl at the bar. Things are going well for him and he leaves with his girl. I run into Gloria and we're both drunk. We immediately dance, make out, and sleep together. The next morning she tells me that she has a boyfriend but it sounds like things aren't going well. I don't mind being her sex partner.

I start to feel guilt because I hadn't told Jericho about it so I decided to let him know what happened. He says he's cool but making less eye contact so I know he's upset about it. I give him space for a bit but he comes back and tells me that its fine because he shouldn't have told me that he had given up on Gloria.

Gloria texts me and tells me that she loves her boyfriend so she doesn't want to have a friends with benefits anymore. I realize that I liked her more than I originally thought, but there's no helping it.

November. I see Gloria again after a long time on a night out with mutual friends. Chemistry is still there. She stays at my place with a few other people, but nothing happens. Or maybe we made out--I can't recall because I was drunk. But I didn't do anything I didn't want to do. The next morning, I kiss her goodbye.

Jericho is still upset over the Gloria thing so I promise him I won't do anything else with her. We all go on a trip and Gloria is clearly attached to me. I like her too but I don't know how to respond responsibly. We go out clubbing and in my drunken state, I take a different girl home with me to my hotel. Gloria apparently cried.

I don't know how to salvage this. On the one hand, I really like Gloria. But she has a bf and I'm not sure if I could fully trust her in a relationship. But there's something very genuine about her affection for me and I'm not sure if it's an act.

Jericho understands our chemistry now and has given me the go ahead as long as I'm discreet about it. But I can tell that he's only saying these things because he thinks that he has to. I think that pursuing anything with Gloria would change our friendship irreparably. I'm not willing to do that because he's a great friend.

Meanwhile, I have all these feelings for Gloria I want to suppress but can't. Maybe that ship has sailed since I slept with someone else. How should I proceed in this?

**tl;dr**:  Friend likes girl. Two dates, nothing. Tells me he's over her. Girl likes me and the feeling is mutual. We sleep together but she has a bf. She wants to be friends with benefits but changes her mind soon after. Friend is upset that I slept with her so I apologize and promise not to see her again. I see girl again, we kiss. On a trip with the friend and girl, she clearly is attracted to me and maybe wants more. I reciprocate flirtation and am kind to her. That same night I get drunk and sleep with someone else. Girl is very upset. Friend would have been upset if I slept with her, so I didn't take her seriously. Meanwhile, I'm crushing hard on girl.

23431,Breakups,24ffa4,"A little back story: My SO, who we shall call Katie for private purposes, and I started dating at the end of my freshmen year/her sophomore year. We have been together for 3 amazing years. Our families are close, so close that I went on a European vacation with them last summer. I was living the high life, dating a beautiful,older girl who just completed me in every way possible.
 
Fast forward to this year, she leaves for college about 3 hours away while I finish my senior year of high school. Things were really hard at first but we found a way to make the long distance deal work by video calling and she came home often and I visited her frequently as well. Things seemed even better when I was accepted to a university an hour away from her that I had dreamed of going to my entire life. We began discussing our future, jokingly, but it was still nice that she had thought about a future with me. 

Now fast forward again to about a month ago. She is accepted to this camp at her school that helps incoming freshmen learn all the school traditions and what not of the university. I was proud of her because this was a way for her to make new friends (seeing as how her roommate and sister were her only friends). Well for this camp, they pair you with someone of the opposite sex. I don't love the idea but I know it isn't something I should be worried about because she is very faithful. Things start getting weird when she is uploading pictures everyday of her and her partner, who we will call Michael. Now, I don't know why I was worried because he too has a SO in high school like Katie did, so us four were all a part of the same situation.

To make things even worse, she changes all her social media profile pictures to pictures of her and Michael (when they used to be us). Now I feel awful and finally confront her about it. She tells me things are different in high school and that I shouldn't worry and next year I'll understand. Well I tell her regardless of what level of education I'm in, this still bothers me. I didn't want to be abusive and ask her to change it but it really really bothered me. Well I dropped it because it wasn't worth fighting for, especially a few days before she came back into town.

Let us move forward again, but this time about 2 weeks ago. She's home and we are hanging out just watching TV, everything feels normal. I start to get annoyed because rather than converse with me she is on her phone the whole time. I glance over to see what she is doing and she is Snapchatting this Michael douche (for those of you who don't know what Snapchat is, it's a picture messaging app where the picture if only available for a few seconds.) Well her and I snapchat all the time but recently it slowed for what I figured was her massive amounts of studying. I began to investigate and find out that she snapchats Michael almost twice as much as me, which is odd because Katie and I snapchat several times a day. I bring it up to her because, a few months prior, she did the same to me. She apologizes and explains that they have conversations through this app and I again dismiss it and move on, but a little angry. She is also texting him frequently too which irks me. She goes home and we continue everything as normal but now I'm starting to get irritated.

Move forward to last week, we argue about Michael again because I just can't keep biting the bullet. She then discusses how maybe we should break up because she doesn't want to upset me with pictures of friends and that we ought to have time to ourselves to discover who we are. I don't like this idea but if she wants it to happen then all be it. Well she chickens out and we make up. 

Now we are present time. She had a sorority spring formal and I was her date. I leave school early, book it through Dallas traffic and make it there right after 3 hours of speed driving. I'm ecstatic to see her because she lives in a nice house off campus and extracurricular activities always follow a long night. Well her and I are getting ready in her room and she just strips down for me being all sexy and funny then puts on her dress. We head out to the living room where there is a party going on and we mingle and take a bunch of cute couples pictures. I notice she is snapchatting Michael again. Awesome, but I play cool and ignore it but then he texts her too. I see that oddly enough, all their messages are deleted...the red flag goes up. I take her into another room and ask what's wrong because she is being different, uninterested almost. We discuss the whole being alone and not being jealous thing again and we agree to just go and have fun and try and move on. 

The dance is great, lots of food and fun. We come back and I know things are about to be great. We get into bed and then just turns the light off and says goodnight. I'm confused , this has never happened. I ask what is up and she says she's tired. Right, well, the morning could still be fun so I go to bed. Well I wake up and cuddle next to her, being super sweet and all. Things get interesting but her kisses feel cold and unwanted. I try and make a move and she pulls away and says not today. THAT is when it finally clicked. I got up, put pants on and start getting together and she just starts balling. Her and I both knew what was happening and this time, there was no avoiding it. We talked about it and it was the same conversation as before, we need to be alone. This time she feels bad because I drove all the way down there for this. I hug her, kiss her on the head, tell her I love her one last time and leave, all while she is covered in tears. I see her sister on the way out and I tell her what happened and then leave. 

I drove for 2 hours in utter silence. I cant' believe this happened. Her and I were supposed to be that couple that everyone loved. We were supposed to prove people wrong. She tells me that her and I were too different and we weren't meant for each other, which blows my mind. She tells me she can never love me again. That is when I lose it. I cried harder than I ever have. Harder than when my sister died or when my parents got divorced. To make it worse, a Texas State Trooper clocks me at 84mph in a 65mph zone. I lose it again and don't think I can even make it home. I cry the last hour, somehow manage to make it home alive. I tell my mom and then hibernate for 6 hours in my room. I call my 2 bestfriends and tell them and suddenly I get poured with texts apologizing to me. I don't want pity. 

Now I don't know what to do. Prom is Saturday and I've already ordered my tux. We canceled our trip to Vegas. I don't even know what I'm asking from you guys. I just want people to hear this I guess. Thanks.

I had heard something, called her out for it, and that was that.  I haven't contacted her in over 3 weeks.  Recently she started liking a bunch of my stuff on Facebook.

Three months ago, my girlfriend of seven months broke up with me. She told me that we were better as friends, and that she wanted that back. I tried to stay friends but it was too painful, so we just drifted apart over the last three months. In the relationship, everything seemed to be great. I was the happiest I had ever been, and I was fairly certain the same was for her. I treated her the best I could possibly manage, and she, while after we broke up i realised that she wasnt the BEST girlfriend, made me the happiest guy in the world. Unfortunately it didnt last, and I tried to stop having feelings for her. I, being the President of my senior class at high school, got around to talking to loads of girls, just to try and keep my mind away from her. We share one class, and I see her in the halls often, and we occasionally talked. Anyways, yesterday she told me basically that she was sorry, she was happy with me and she didn't know why she felt the need to break up with me, but she regrets that. She also said she still has feelings for me. I confessed to her that I had tried to shake my feelings of her, but i couldn't, and that i still had feelings for her. We decided to meet up today and talk about us. She said she couldnt promise what happened wont happen again, but that she didnt appreciate me before, and she would now, and she would try and be the best she could possibly be for me. 

I dont know what to do. I still have feelings for her, she made me happy, but I dont know if i would be able to trust her again. I dont know if i should try this again.

So I'm a 23 year old female with a huge crush on this guy who goes to my university. We actually used to go to the same high school, but we weren't close friends at the time (we had a lot of mutual friends and were in a few clubs together after school). 

Anyway about a month ago we ran into each other on campus and We exchanged phone numbers so we could catch up. Since then we've been spending some time together at school, usually around one to two times a week (getting coffee, chatting in hallway). But we haven't hung out off campus. 

Usually when we see each other, he'll walk with me to my next class and we'll hug goodbye. I don't know if I'm reading too much into it, but sometimes I'll say text me when you want to hang out and he'll automatically tell me he's free the next day. But then other times he'll just say it was great seeing you which, to me, kind of sounds like we might not see each other again soon (lol). 
 
I really don't know how he feels about me.  I really like him and I think he's sweet and insanely attractive but I'm afraid he doesn't see me as more than just a friend and a casual one at that. A few days ago I tried to show some interest by buying him a coffee for his birthday but I don't know if that was enough of a hint. 

This week is also spring break. I've been secretly fantasizing about just texting him that I like him or I think he's cute but idk we might be too old for that haha. I've also thought about stopping by where he works (food place near where I live) for lunch just so I could see him for a little while. But idk if that would be weird too.

Then wedding planning troubles started. Her father lied to her, my family and me, and i was the one who proved it to my fiance (she was in denial). I am convinced he is an awful influence on her and this conversation has led to much fighting between us.

I am in a different country right now, and have no one i know i can talk to. I am hoping when i get back we can work though these differences. Right now the big problem according to her is we are missing something that everyone else has, and since its been 4 years it is too late to work through. Thiss this is the first time this has been a problem.


I personally think i screwed things up by showing her how bad her father really is, and that shattered her perfect daddy picture and got her to dislike me. And part of it is if she breaks up with me she continue to rationalize back that her dad is the superman that she once thought he was. 
P.S. It was conclusively proven he lied and deceived her, her whole life.

They were always over stupid things. We always made up that night or the next morning. He's told me before (mostly when I was already upset over something) that he hated our fighting. He has broken up with me twice during the course of our relationship because of the arguing, but they never lasted for more than a day or two.

About two months ago, after another stupid argument, I asked him if he wanted to break up. Sometimes I would ask him this just to see what he would say, but he told me that he did want to break up because he was unhappy with our relationship. We broke up for a day, but then got back together. We ended up breaking up again about a week later because things hadn't gotten much better. We were still arguing, but this time around he wasn't calm and would keep the argument going. We didn't talk for 5 days after this break up because he said he needed to cool down and think about things. After the 5 days, we got back together again. hHe told me that he still wanted to try to work things out, but told me again how unhappy he was. By this time, I kept questioning him because I couldn’t tell if he actually wanted to try to make our relationship work or if he was prolonging the relationship. We still kept arguing because I wasn’t sure what he really wanted and he kept focusing on how unhappy he was. He kept saying things like 'I'm afraid the writing is on the wall, but I can still see us working out.' Then, a week ago, he finally told me that he just wasn’t in love with me anymore and wanted to see other people. For some reason, I was shocked. Even though we had been going back and forth for two months, I never thought he would actually say these things to me and end it. 

I am leaving for two months this Sunday to begin training for a new career. I keep asking him over and over again if he was just fed up with our arguing and if he wanted to take these two months off to figure out what we really want. He's told me repeatedly that he is no longer in love with me and doesn't think that time apart will do us any good. 

We always had a communication problem, especially at his end. He admitted that he let everything build up over the past few months and is just tired of it. We saw each other EVERYDAY for 6 years. The longest we went without see one another was for 2 weeks and that was 4 years ago. We were constantly at one another's side. Even during these last two months that we were trying to work things out, we never took time apart. We went back into our old routine. We never gave each other the time to miss one another in 6 years.

Basically, I realized too late that I should have taken him seriously. He was a great boyfriend. I am still in love with him and I feel in my gut that we still have a chance. I believe that we just need these two months apart. However, he keeps telling me that he is set on his feelings for me and that he wants to see other people. He also says that he isn't completely counting out the idea of us getting back together in the future, but right now is he convinced that he isn't in love with me anymore. I don't understand how he suddenly just knows that he doesn't love me anymore.

Are we really over? Should I hold onto the hope that we just need time? Or do I just try to move on.

23457,Dating,38wpe6,"So, like I mentioned, I'm twenty four, he's twenty six. We met on Tinder, and we started talking, and we got along really well. We went on a couple dates, and started to get really close, emotionally attached, and we were clearly taking things too fast. But, we started to slow down. While we were talking, I told him I went on a date with someone, and he was upset, but then we had a talk about exclusivity and I said we were both on board. But he did say during that conversation, you can see whoever you want to see, I'm not stopping you from doing anything - I said I'm going to stop. Anyway, fast forward to this past weekend and he was supposed to stay over for the weekend. So, we had problems having sex Friday night, but we had incredible sex Saturday morning. During the night and the morning, this guy I used to sext is calling me and snapping me. He knew I was with this guy, but still did so. A week before this incident, and a day after the exclusivity talk, I had told this sexter that I'm done sexting, and because he was taking it hard, I told him stuff like, I still want to fuck you, I still want to be fucked by you, I'm yours. And he saved those messages on Snapchat. So, back to the present, the guy that is sleeping over, sees a few snap chats with him, and he later demands to see the whole conversation. He kind of manipulated me into seeing those messages. After he saw those messages, everything went downhill. I told him, I was breaking it off at that point, I'm not sexting anyone, I'm just with you, if I wanted to be with him, I'd be with him. He said he can't trust me anymore and that this is basically over. I tried to tell him that we weren't in a relationship, and that I'm willing to give it all up if he could give us a second chance. He says he's not like that and he doesn't give second chances. So, he leaves and says that he might consider giving us a second chance, but only at my insistence, and I don't really believe him. I really want him to give us a second chance, I think we'd really work out. Is there anything I could say or do to make him give us a second chance? I was in a three year relationship before, and I am honestly just not a cheater, I'm very loyal. I just want to make this work.

23458,Breakups,3c31ch,"The story began when I met a girl while playing a game back in October. At first it was just casual 
talk but then we started hanging out more. In the end we started a long distance relationship. To be specific,
the distance is quite a significant factor, about 6000km. I decided to come for a visit, and in the end of January I
flew over for a month. We lived together for the whole time and despite some arguments, which everyone has, everything was going pretty good. After I returned I knew I had to focus on studies and graduate University, since I only had one semester left. We dated for about half a year. 

I started working two jobs simultaneously and writing my diploma. The schedule was killing me, but I knew it was well worth it. I slept for about four hours a day. A month has passed after I came back and all of a sudden she told me things were not working out and she's not looking for a relationship at this time. A week later I found out she met a guy, and that was heartbreaking. We said some nasty things to each other, and I'm not proud of the way I acted. We talked some time after and I apologized for that, after all, the time I spent with her was the best time of my life. After some time passed I realized I could live without her, so I decided that once I graduate (which is today), I'm going to book a ticket, fly over and sort things out. I know for certain, she's the one. Well some things happened, and I got really sick. I'm scheduled for a complex operation in the beginning of August, and if I don't do it the consequences might be severe, but that's not the problem. I'm still willing to do everything I can to fix this mess, even move there since I'm done with all my business in my hometown.

I want to marry that girl. Two days ago after we talked and I told her I would be coming over she told me that theres absolutely no way we could be together again, that she's not attracted to me at all anymore, and that she's moving in with her new boyfriend.

We spent everyday together, exuded love, fairy tale etc. Then she moved back to Florida to go to school and I was stuck in Washington, where we first met. 

We tried skype dates and visiting one another. Despite this, the relationship began to deteriorate. I started getting more distant and detached from her. I was honest and told her that I felt like I wanted to seek out other girls even though I loved her. She told me I had to question which I valued more - our relationship or my sexual pleasure. I realized how much she loved me and how honest we were together and decided that I wouldn't trade this relationship for anything. So we dealt with it. 

Fast forward 2 months. We get into a fight over skype date / friend prioritization. She was speaking with a couple of male friends instead of speaking to me, which really pissed me off because I had sacrificed a specific time to speak to her. I questioned her commitment and she tried it to twist it on me and I essentially told her I wouldn't take her crap and told her to go f herself.

So I have this 'friend' who is 30F, I asked her out about 3 months ago. We went on couple of dates, and later she told me she doesn't want to be in a relationship. I responded that its completely ok as its her decision and i respect that. Meanwhile, we didn't stopped talking and became good friends. 

Later she shared her past story with me, she met a guy earlier who she was committed to. They were going to get married but she found out that he had a live-in girlfriend at the same time they were dating. She broke-off all relationship with him and is not in touch with him anymore. This incident has scarred her for life and she don't think that she can trust anybody ever again. She realizes now that there were lots of red flag with him, he used to control her a lot, was very possessive and jealous but what hurts her most is that he broke her trust. She says that she thinks I am a 'nice' guy (I am not sure what she means by 'nice' and if she is putting me in that stereotype) and she likes talking to me and spending time with me. We meet often, have lots of chat, but we as of now we are not technically 'dating'. 

Sometimes she talks to me like she is my girlfriend, gets inquisitive about any of my friends who are girls, sometime even jokes that let run away to different country together etc. But she has lots of trust issues, if we are chatting and my phone rings she has to know what/who that is. She has taken my phone couple of times to see what is there, she couldn't find anything because I am not that type of guy. When she does such things, I do get irritated a bit but then I think maybe if I show her that I don't have anything to hide she will be able to trust me. I don't know whether I should do that or not.

She says that incident in her past life has changed her a lot, she was not like this. Now she says that she thinks whats the point of dating/marriage. All men are cheaters. Whats the point of being in relationship because its complicated. Why have so much drama in life, no relationships no drama. But she is always confused about all these things. When I talk to her and tell her that you cannot make any conclusion about all the men based on a single event, at that point she agrees that I am right and she should not do that. But later she again will switch back to her previous confusion. Because of this, situation is little complicated for both of us. 

What I really like to know from you all is, how do I deal with this situation. She knows that I have feelings for her, I care for her but I feel she is not reciprocating because of her trust issues. What can I do to make her life easier? what can I do to make her start trusting again? OR should I just keep my distance and think it as a lost cause.

It took me a lot to get over that fact, but eventually, I met her and finally dealt with my demons. After a couple of months, and some serious discussion, it didn't bother me any more. I felt way more prepared to go back into the dating world after things ended...

Until I started dating Alfred. So, Alfred and I had a super-amazing-awesome *gush, gush, puppy-eyes* first date. He mentioned an ex-girlfriend and that they shared a cat and everything. It actually didn't bother me at all. I have an ex that I see every once in a while I thought (although for me, I normally keep contact at an absolute minimum once I start going out with someone; it just seems right). 

One night, he asked for some photos so that he could send them to a friend who wanted to know what I looked like. Not even two hours later, he contacted me and told me how his ex-girlfriend was jealous because I was so pretty. Seriously, wtf? It's not just me right? That sent up a pretty big red flag. I asked more about his ex-girlfriend. It turns out that she's pretty much his best friend and they hang out at each others' places about 2-3 times per week. 

We had a pretty decent conversation for a while longer, but after I hung up, I just couldn't get it out of my head. 2-3 times per week? He says he's not attracted to her anymore, but they were engaged and lived together for over a year. To tell you the truth, I believe that he's not having sex with her. That's not the issue. The issue is that I don't want to be the one he has sex with, and then he goes to her for friendship, closeness, bonding, etc. 

I called him the next day and admitted I was too insecure to deal with this situation (I was as honest as possible), and that maybe things could open up in the future if he was seeing her less and I had worked on being more secure. I thought that was more than fair. But he was hurt and said it was unfair that I was punishing him. He argued with me for over an hour to try to keep things on board and said he still wanted to see me. I finally gave in, but said we should meet as friends. We went out that night, but it was awkward, so I had some champagne and we went further than I had anticipated, which I somewhat regret. That, I admit, is entirely my fault. The next morning, I still felt rotten about the whole ex deal and this time, I kind of got upset about it and broke it off again. It wasn't my finest moment. He just... couldn't understand where I was coming from and said he was really sad.

We connect really well together, but I feel like if he's still spending that much time with someone else, that it will be hard to get him to see me as his best friend too, and eventually, that's what I really want. Sex and infatuation come and go, but connecting and bonding with someone is what I'm really looking for, and I already feel like he has it with her.

Am I just being crazy and insecure? Should I try to get over it? What would you do?

23472,Infidelity,1m77eq,"Like the title says, I found out about 8 months ago that for the first 6 weeks of our relationship Emily (31F) was still living with her abusive ex-boyfriend, Jake (M/35). We've been dating for about 16 months now and I just haven't been able to get over this, I'm at a loss at what to do. Any advice would be really appreciated.

As some back story, when we started dating Emily told me Jake wasn't living there anymore but that he still had a ton of his crap at her place and was getting it out of there. In reality he was sleeping there a few nights a week as he gradually moved out and eventually into his mother's house (Emily says she slept on the couch those nights and that they never shared a bed). I also came to find out that they'd have dinner together some nights Emily and I didn't get together, they played a round of golf one Sunday, and emailed each other a few times during the day most days. She explains now she was checking in on when he was going to be around and went to dinner so as not to stir the pot etc - like maintaining until she finally was able to kick him out. The fact is she lied to me about a really serious event at the start of our relationship.

When we talked about Jake when Emily and I started dating, I understood and tried to be supportive as she ended what was a very controlling, problematic, and abusive relationship. Her story then was that she wouldn't let me come over for those first 6 weeks or so because she was embarrassed that her house was so disgusting, etc., and just wanted time to clean it all up before I came over. I get the red flags now and shouldn't have bought that stupid story, I should've just ended it then or stopped seeing her until she got her shit sorted out. Ultimately she ended up spending 4-5 nights a week at my place though and I guess it didn't really bother me that I couldn't go over her house because we were spending so much time together anyway. It came to head about 2 months in when we got into a fight about it and a few days later I went over for the first time (and it *was* disgusting). We spent the night either there or at my place over the next months and eventually I moved in some months later as my lease was up.

I get angry when I think about it - I'm really trying to get over this and our relationship is otherwise fantastic now, but I feel like I was either a guy she cheated on him with, or worse, she was cheating on both of us for the start of our relationship. I get angry that the dates we went on and the fun times we shared as we were getting to know each other are now tainted - like she was this wonderful person with me and then would go home and live this double life with this asshole right after. She swears up and down that she didn't sleep with him and that she hadn't for months before we started dating, and that she only interacted with him and spent evenings with him to avoid confrontation or getting hurt. I don't trust this though, she lied to me and told me many times he wasn't there and that she wasn't even seeing him when in fact not only was he there, they were doing things together.

My gut tells me she let it play out this way because she felt sorry for him, not because she was keeping her options open with the two of us or anything. When I think about those fun months together though it all feels fake to me. I don't know what to do, we've talked about it enough and I've told her I just want to move on from this and we can't keep rehashing old shit but in reality I haven't been able to move on from it. I get angry that she wasn't able to end it when we started dating or that I somehow wasn't enough for her to end it right away. I don't trust her fully and I ask myself if this is the type of woman I want to spend my life with. These aren't thoughts I should be having in a healthy relationship and I know the general consensus will be to just end it, it's been this long and I haven't been able to get over it. I don't know what I want here though, maybe just some advice from someone who was/is in a similar situation or some perspective on how difficult it can be to get out of an abusive relationship?

23483,Breakups,20oa6y,"My ex partner and my relationship was always a struggle. Unfortunately his mother committed suicide at the very start of our relationship. It destroyed him.. He blames himself and completely shut off from the world making him bitter towards most things and would often say 'you know I don't care about anything anymore.. I don't feel anything anymore.' It definitely brought us closer but I feel the depression caused him to take his anger out against me more as I was there for him since the start.

He was always thankful I was around to pull him through everything, and so am I, but as a few years went by I realised really how broken he was. If we would disagree he wouldn't be able to control himself and his anger would come out. By anger I mean he would verbally abuse me. He would shout at me that he doesn't love me, that I'm stupid, if I cried he would laugh, if I begged him to stop he would get worse, he would point his finger and shout and scream and swear. I wouldn't recognize his face when he was like that, it was almost scary. Then after a few hours he would calm down, apologize, beg me to stay, sometimes cry and we would go back to normal.

At the start I could deal with it as I knew he must be devastated.. but over time I started to believe the insults and he would make me feel like I was causing him to be like this. So I would continuously try and help in in every way.. Clean for him (we didn't live together), cook everything, organise anything I could, drove him everywhere, paid for what I could, we even went backpacking to destinations he wanted so he could get more out of it.. I just never told him that. I'd just never think of myself, I'd always wake up and go okay what do I need to do for him today? And I didn't mind that way of thinking, I wanted to help him in any way I could because I was hopeful I could fix him.

He refused to seek professional help, he only saw weed as a way to feel better. And it did work for him, but he ended up having to smoke it to feel better.. he couldn't feel good without it. Which made it hard because I'd start wishing he'd smoke more so I never got the normal him. Then when he drank.. well that made his other side come out even worse.

Anyway the sex stopped about 4 months ago, and he was just always biting at anything I said.. I told him I was thiknking about leaving, and I could tell he didn't want that to happen. He'd always say he thought he'd end up alone for life because who would take him like that? Which made me want to stay even more. 

Anyway.. a few weeks ago he snapped, over honestly nothing. I apologised straight away. I told him I loved him, that I was sorry (just so he'd stop) and he kept going. I was so devastated because we had been apart for three weeks on a seperate holiday, the next day I woke up and just decided I couldn't do this anymore. I was developing anxiety because I was worried he'd yell at me over nothing, I ended up feeling I had no voice.

To be honest the break up was the most peaceful thing we've ever done, he said to me 'the break up would be harder for me because i'd want to be with someone one day again, he never does again.' He also said to me that he knew we'd never last.. Which hurt me so much.

Anyway I am okay.. but there comes moments when I feel like I failed him. Like if I just held on I could've fixed him because, I know, no one else in his life took care of him like I did and it's scaring me that no one really is right now and I want to be there for him.

Some days I want to call and tell him I want him back because I love him and I want to help him forever, but some moments I know I did the right thing because he never wanted to care for me really it was all about him and ultimately my life wouldn't be a happy one.

I just feel so guilty and I feel like a horrible person for leaving.

23484,Breakups,1nqxtp,"tl;dr: We broke up. I had trust issues, could never solve it. He gave up and i had to go back home. Broken and don't know what to do! Was it my fault?

WALL OF TEXT!! SORRRYYYY! (not a native english speaker, sorry for that too!)

We were together for about 2 years and in love. I love him and still think about him constantly, see him in my dreams. This will be long! Sorry!

So we met at university. He is smart, ambitious and successful. But here is the problem. I have huge trust issues, especially since he likes to drink a lot when he is out with friends. I did witness few unpleasant things when he was drunk when i was visiting him back home. He pushed me into kissing some other male friend (not the first time it is happening). Then he kissed his best guy friend. This guy friend is bi, and i learned it is not the first time it is happening. They once did on a dare (full on making out) and once drunk in front of his ex. Also they were in a threesome (mfm) and he assured me that he did things with only the girl. I was not comfortable with him being around that friend since he always pushed him into hooking up with girls or threesomes, even though i was with him. Trust issues started from that. Then he has this best female friend that he had feelings for long time ago. I asked him about that and he lied, but when i pushed him he admitted and told me there is nothing to worry about, it is in the past. But his actions told me otherwise. He would put pictures which had her in them and someone else as his profile picture. One with me and her, the other her and some other friend. Seemed like he liked having her around more.It felt he liked showing her off more on his profile than me. We always had small discussions because of small things like that and he would say my jealousy is too much. I brought these things up rarely and when they were bothering me. Now what he could have done is just comfort me. He knew i had trust and daddy issues. He broke my trust few times and i let him know what bothered me. Especially his drinking. He still said he will do it but he can control himself. I know it is almost impossible to do that when you are very drunk. He has female friends that he sends postcards to when he travels. One of them he slept with long time ago (which i sometimes think he still has some feelings for) and one he flirted with. The one he flirted is far relative, not blood related, he said it was not flirting but something innocent. If it was innocent, she wouldn't be posting love songs on his walls, liking every picture and posting hearts and kisses with comments. Anyways, i am not an angel either. I was jealous and had insecurity issues, was always paranoid when he was out with his friends. I didn't have a job or anything to keep me busy, and friends. We moved into a new city because of his job. we knew no one. everything was about him

Now this is why i am confused. He asked me to move in with him. He was so caring and loving when we lived together. Would take care of me. Clean the house, help me with my dissertation and be silly with me. 

The country we were staying in required for me to have a visa in order to stay or work. I had issues with my dissertation so i prolonged the visa. i stayed there longer to see if i can find a job, which was impossible. We were having little issues then and towards the end it was getting very stressful. One chance was to get married which both of us were not ready for.I decided to travel and give him space while he went back home. While traveling we had small arguments, again me being jealous because he was being around that female friend again and getting drunk. I make him sound like an asshole, but he is not. I came back from my travels and he seemed to change, we had a discussion and he dropped the bomb.. He said he could not take it anymore, all the jealousy and trust issues. He said especially if we have to get married, it will be a disaster, he is the strong one and wants to end. I almost wanted to die then. We had a trip planned to go together.(which we did, and it didn't end well) During the trip he got drunk and started becoming too chatty and flirty with other girls. The last few days he was quite disrespectful towards me. He even left me the last few days by myself in a different country, where i didn't speak the language. I did get by by myself, met new people, but still. It was heartbreaking, seeing a man that loved and cared about me just turned into this man that would say, i don't want to be with you anymore or i am glad this relationship is over. 

Now i am back home. No contact from him for almost 10 days. I wish he contacted me, said that he misses me. But it seems like he is moving on and happy. Has a perfect job, girls around and friends. As if i never existed. I sometimes wonder if he is hurting as much as me? If i still have the chance to get him back? Am i guilty? Was i not good enough?

I'm not in love with my ex. It could've possibly gotten there, but he broke up with me before I had time to find out. I've been in love twice before, and I know what it's like, and I didn't feel that strongly with this guy, not yet at least. But I did really like him, I still do, and it's hard.

So let's go from the start, as simple as possible. I started sleeping with Bob to get over my ex Fred. Bob had the same reason, to get over his ex Nancy. I loved Fred, Bob loved Nancy. I got over Fred, it was really hard, but now we're best friends to this day. Bob had dated Nancy for longer than I had dated Fred, and they did much more together and it was a lot harder for Bob to get over Nancy.

But we started dating. And it was really good, for 2 months. We gamed together, went on lovely dates, amazing sex and just all in all really good.

But then it ended. I went over to visit, and he told me he
* still wasn't over Nancy and wasn't ready for a relationship just yet
* even though he liked dating me,he didn't see a future

For a week and a half we decided to be friends with benefits. Really nothing much changed. We kept having sex, kept cuddling, kept gaming together and going to movies and pizza. But we didn't call it dating. We didn't hold hands in public and we went back to Single on facebook.

So now you're up to date.

Thing is, he told me he's been considering casual sex with other girls. I'd still be one, but they'd be others too.
And he's being hanging out with my best friend Julie a lot.
It sends me into a massive paranoia that they're going to sleep together, and it hurts so much inside.

I don't know if I can stay his friend and watch him move on.

I'm wondering if I should cut the friends w/ benefits, or cut the whole thing. Cutting the FwB sure would help, but I'd still have to watch him move onto other girls.

23492,Infidelity,2omv88,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about 4.5 years. To say things have been consistently great would be a lie, but it's been wonderful regardless simply due to our compatibility. Beyond that compatibility, however, lay a valley of problems. For the first nine months of our relationship, after 3 years of very close friendship (as in; we might as well have been dating), I found I had to make a significant change. I was bailing on her to go out with my friends all of the time, I would avoid important things like her grandmother's funeral or holidays with her, and in general I was much more aloof about the relationship than her. I suppose, looking back on it, that she was a little bit overly gung-ho in the beginning. I had a well-developed, well-trusted, vetted group of very tight-knit friends that had taken years and lots of luck to get together. That was shattered when we started dating. In those first nine months, I chose my friends over her as she tried to show how much she cared for me by wanting to be with me at all times. I thought it was over-bearing and got scared. All of that came to a head on Easter when I bailed on our plans to go on a sudden mushroom trip with my friends. At the end of the night, as I returned home, she and I talked and I decided to change my priorities.

The next year and a half was filled with sacrifices. I lost a number of friends ranging from buddies to close companions, almost completely due to my relationship, and made significant changes to my personality and general demeanor. She was very grateful for this, and after about a year of me doing everything I could to be a better boyfriend, she decided it was time to even things out again. I started hanging out with my friends again, but there was definitely a difference. A sort of gap that, years later, has only widened. I do not regret these early times, but I definitely wish she and I had done certain things differently. Regardless, the following six months after that year were wonderful. I got her over her intense disregard for things like smoking marijuana and drinking beer (didn't make her a party girl or anything, just taught her that a little weed won't kill you) and we ended up finding more things in life to share with each other. Our bond definitely strengthened, but there were definitely still some glaring issues, exacerbated by a couple of events.

During those first nine months, since I had a hard time finding an actual job, I was selling weed. Strictly to my friends and a couple of out-of-towners, but I was making good money. We went out frequently, I bought her stuff all the time, and I blew practically all of that money on her. Anyway, there was a girl that picked up from me. Let's call her Mary. Mary and I had a history, a very long history, filled with hot and cold moments. She and I had been best friends for a long time, stopped hanging out entirely, re-connected and became better friends than before, stopped hanging out entirely, then re-connected when I became the only good dope dealer in town. She would hit me up every night after her evening shift at IHOP, and she was dating one of my best friends and one of the best guys I know. The problem my girlfriend had with this arrangement? I had been in love with this girl for a long time before my current relationship. Now, I don't mean puppy-love, I mean actual love. She manipulated me, strung me along, and did quite a number of those things that make up the mythical friendzone. 

Then I met my current girlfriend, fell further in love, and proceeded to not give a damn about Mary. Of course, this is when Mary starts to take notice of me. We become friends again when she notices I sell dope, and she begins to act like she and I hadn't ended our friendship in a several hour-long screaming match that she walked away from after quoting fucking Fight Club (ah, angst). She starts by coming over every couple of days to pick up, silently, and slowly moves towards coming by every day. Then coming by every day after work. Then coming by every day after work and smoking me down with my own product. I thought nothing of it, utilizing the situation to get some verification on some stuff for my friend she was dating (seeing if she was cheating on him... she was). But, despite having no more interest in her, I found it comforting to be around her still. I actually enjoyed our evening rendez-vous. Eventually, though, she starts to get weird about it. Randomly asking my girlfriend how I am in bed, mentioning to her that she picked a good one, commenting during our smoke sessions that she's sick of her boyfriend (my good friend) and wants other dick (literally a quote), and in general growing increasingly flirtatious.

Throughout all of this, my girlfriend is demanding/begging/asking me to stop hanging out with her at night. She thinks it's weird. At the time, young me thought it was silly to try and restrict what anyone does, and that everyone should just let others do whatever they want so long as it doesn't restrict anyone else from doing whatever they want (this is stupid and not universal). So, after a while, I tell my girlfriend that I won't see Mary at night anymore. Obviously, I lied. I saw her the next night and heard from her some disturbing stuff. The night following that, I go out to a beach with her boyfriend and another friend to have a bonfire. I mention what she said to me, what she'd been saying to me, and what that seemed to imply she was doing based on other evidence, and he was understandably furious. They didn't break up right away, but my friendship with Mary was gone for good this time. Despite that, this event has always been something that my girlfriend will drag into the situation in the midst of some of our worst arguments.

She's had problems with all of my female friends, actually she's had problems with every non-family female I've ever interacted with. Period. I only have one female friend left now (who, based on some to-be-covered circumstances, is no longer my friend) and my girlfriend and I constantly fight about her. We'll call this girl Anne. Anne and I have been friends since we were kids. We didn't always hang out, but we never have been on negative standing with each other. Really ever. The year that my girlfriend and I got together, Anne's friendship with me became much more intimate, but still very much platonic. We hung out very regularly, shared some interesting experiences, and in general become quite close. So, as my girlfriend and I begin our relationship, she is automatically jealous of Anne. Not just because of how close we are, but because of Anne's looks. Now, Anne isn't a looker per se, but she's voluptuous and at the time dressed very... erm... scantily. After an occurence on 4/20 the year my gf and I got together (Anne wore a rasta-colored bikini under her clothes, my girlfriend commented on it in school, Anne said Yeah, I thought [my name] would really like it! I go over to Anne's house for a giant smoking session that day, and she nonchalantly undresses to her bikini in her bedroom in front of me. I leave the room, the end), my girlfriend begins constantly, consistently, and without fail finding something Anne/I did any time she was around us that somehow implied we were dying to fuck each other. Now, let me say, I do not find Anne attractive. Her body is pleasing to the eye, sure, but there's a few glaring issues: 1.) She's not bright 2.) Her face is very much meh at best, that's way more important to me than figure 3.) She's way too much of a girly girl for me.  Beyond all of this, she's also been dating one of my best friends (remember the guy who dated Mary?). None of this deters my girlfriend, who goes to great lengths to try and prove that Anne wants me and I want her. Whether or not Anne is interested in me, I do not know and do not care. Regardless, this girl has been mentioned in what has to be at least 60% of the arguments me and my girlfriend have and I never have been able to mention her to any capacity in any discussion without incurring extreme jealousy and the high potential for an argument.

So, continuing the many rocky aspects of our relationship, I have tried to break up with her around 7 times. Now, that does not mean 7 times I said the words I want to break up, but it means 7 times I went to see her with full intent to leave there a single man. See, there was a significant point of my life wherein I believed my deceased father's words that love is worthless and fleeting at best. So, back then, being so interested in a girl that I'm beyond comfortable doing nothing with her and am thinking about our future together was fucking scary. Freaked me out. As a result, there were multiple times that I lost my cool and tried to end what is the most meaningful part of my life out of sheer doubt. Each of these times, I did not go through with it. Each of these times, despite my many fears and despite feeling differently about her than I had before, I decided to give the relationship another week. And, each of these times, that week proved to me that she was worth the fear and doubt. If I had told myself, You're feeling these insecurities for a reason, follow them, I would have missed out on some of the best and happiest years of my life. I would have missed out on the most important woman to me that I've ever met in my life.

So our relationship progresses, time goes by, and eventually I decide to start moving my life in a concentrated direction. I transfer out of the local community college after 2.5 years of electives and dicking around, and get into a public ivy-league school out of state. It's about six hours away from my hometown. My girlfriend and I discuss our options, and both of us want to stay together. We decided to give long distance a shot.

This is where things get very, very, very bad. Long-distance is difficult. Especially for someone like me, who can be so easily blinded by objectivity and logic, long-distance is very difficult. I end up following in my own footsteps during those first nine months; I avoid her, I see her as a burden, I tell her she's suffocating me with her need for attention. She wanted to Skype every day, not a big thing to ask, and I rejected her. I became massively depressed and couldn't understand why (YOU MISS YOUR GIRLFRIEND, DIPSHIT), so I inadvertently pull away from her. This is a painful time for her, and I was beyond difficult and very much not a good boyfriend. It all culminates in one night. I get very drunk out with a friend, then after he and I went our separate ways I went back to the bar and drank some more. Then I got home and drank some more. Then I made the biggest and most impactful mistake of my life.

I don't know why, but I cheated on her. I don't remember the thought process, don't understand how it happened, but I remember it happening. I went on craigslist, found a local man, and invited him over to my apartment (my roommate was gone for the night). He and I start fooling around, until I come to my senses and make him leave. I vomit. Again and again, I vomit. I cry, scream, cry again, and had at least 3 panic attacks. I showered mindlessly, soaping myself up three or four times per wash. I couldn't look in the mirror. Let me end this description by saying that I have since tested myself to see if I find men sexually attractive. I very much do not. I actually went to reddit with this, got some excellent advice, and I decided to talk to my girlfriend about it. Not just for her sake, but for my own sanity.

So, I told her. I called her that morning after being up all night and I told her. She cried, I cried, and so began the second-most trying time in our relationship to date. She's mad at me, but feels guilty about it because of how horribly I reacted. I'm crushed with guilt and shame, and am teetering on the brink of suicide. I come home, we talk, and suddenly we're acting like we always did. As soon as the distance between us was removed, despite the terrible thing that had happened, we were happy. It was weird, out of place, but comfortable and wonderful. I definitely wouldn't have made it out of there if not for her. Being reminded that, despite what I did, there was still a chance for me to be happy and feel normal again made an indescribable amount of difference.

I went back to school and finished my semester, came home and vowed over and over to her to be a more attentive boyfriend. But I underestimated how badly I'd been damaged by my own actions. I begin having regular panic attacks, flashbacks, constant and intense suicidal ideations, deep depressive episodes, and as such I withdrew from the world. I withdrew from her. The summer was lackluster, colored in grays and browns, and when I left for school again I gave my beautiful woman a half-hearted goodbye in the bathroom. I did not talk to her about our relationship with me returning to school. I did not talk to her enough about what happened. I did not soothe her worries. When I was back at school, much of my old ways continued. I did not talk to her enough, did not pay her enough attention, did not verify how much I loved her enough, and the distance became both emotional and physical. During this whole time, I'd been getting more and more in shape. At one point, I maintained an 8 pack. This makes my girlfriend even more jealous than she always was (which was very, very, very jealous), and that becomes compounded with more jealousy and insecurity when I get a job with several women who show interest in me.

When I'm away, my girlfriend stresses intensely.  When she stresses intensely and I'm not there to help her though it, she does not eat. There was a stint of time, we were in a long argument and not talking for a few days, when she did not eat for three days. On the third day, a friend invited her to party. My friend. Anne. Now, I didn't know this, but Anne had apparently been feeding my girlfriend the concept that we needed to break up. Despite hardly seeing me the past year and a half, Anne is convinced I'm a different man. She constantly tells my girlfriend to end it. This particular evening, my girlfriend is out with a collection of Anne's female friends. They all agree with Anne. A mutual male friend of my girlfriend and these girls asks to come out. At this point, my girlfriend (who, remember, has not eaten for several days and usually gets drunk off of 1.5 beers) has been drinking heavily. I mean, as heavily as I used to drink when I was a 260 lb offensive linemen. This guy comes out, the older homebody brother of one of the girls. He's overweight, has very few friends, and spends most of his time in front of his computer. To him, my beautiful and friendly gamer girlfriend is a shining beacon. He constantly, the few times they'd hung out before, follows her around and compliments her. So, this night, he comes out and does the same thing. She is already massively drunk, and he begins buying her drinks. He buys the whole crew a few, but spends his attention on her. She gets drunker and drunker, and very much is beyond ability to walk properly much less drive. Since he is the only one who is not drunk, she asks him to drive her home.

Now, this guy probably hasn't gotten laid in a very long time. He's had a couple of drinks, not many, but a few and my girlfriend is sloppy drunk all over the place. She's naturally flirty to everyone, but far moreso when she's drunk and insecure. Without having any food in her, she's ten times drunker than she would normally be and thereby much more flirty. This guy takes a chance, since she's asked him for a ride and they're alone, and kisses her. She kisses back, only for a second, that asks for the ride home again. He drives her to his house rather than hers, then kisses her again. She leans into this one, their tongues brush, and they kiss for about 5 seconds. Realizing she is heavily inebriated, she asks to go inside and sleep. This motherfucker brings her upstairs to his room and has her sleep on the couch there rather than the guest room. She says that was the end of it, she slept and woke up and left. I haven't had time to ask about a lot of details.

So she doesn't tell me. We talk and stuff, but she doesn't tell me. It takes several days, but finally I figure it out. I pressure her heavily, and finally she relents. She tells me what happened.

I. Flip. Shit. I've never reacted to anything so strongly in my life. I cried, screamed in pain, shouted at her, cussed and stomped and stood on my roof looking at the pavement below. As she's telling the story, she leaves details out. I pressure her and get the details as we go, but it's like pulling teeth. This, I'll soon find, will damage my trust in her. I tell her it wasn't totally her fault. This guy took advantage of her. She tells me she put herself in that position, and she kissed him back, it wasn't his fault. I tell her that he's been hounding her with cheesy compliments every time they hung out, told his younger sister he loved her, and was buying her drinks all night. He did this with intent. I tell her she had not eaten in several days and drank that much? There's no way she was even mildly close to herself (she gets massively horny and loses a lot of inhibition when she drinks, I can't imagine what she was like that night) and there's no way she wanted that to happen in the first place. She says he's sweet, I say he's been jerking off to her image for a few months now. She says she kind of likes him, I tell her that she's probably chemically attracted to him (chemical attraction, that of difference in immune system, is the second most important thing women use to choose their mates). She says that what happened has to mean something, that we always agreed we would end things if either person legitimately cheated with intent. 

I tell her, over and over, this dude took advantage. She was wasted, wasted, wasted drunk and he definitely knew. He was not that intoxicated at all, made a conscious choice to kiss a woman he knew was in love with and dating another man, and then drove her back to his house. I told her, What if you had been blackout? What if you hadn't cut off either kiss? Do you think he would have just let you sleep that night? She says no, he would not have. I tell her that people get arrested and charged with rape for shit like that, that it legally and logically and biologically couldn't be her fault. I tell her this guy didn't give a shit about her feelings or mine, this guy didn't respect her boundaries, this guy didn't care. He's a scumbag. She agrees, but still is hesitant. I can tell why, and verify it with her later; she feels guilty. She's confused, thinks that not immediately freaking out when he kissed her means something important beyond just having been massively drunk, in starvation mode, and severely insecure about our relationship. I ask if she still loves me. She's not sure. She tells me to come down early before Thanksgiving break, I say I can't. There's so much more to this discussion, maybe I'll add it later. It ends with us being uncertain, her telling me over and over that she thinks she needs time to figure herself out.

I change my flight to two days earlier and fly home. I show up, unannounced, at her house. She has strep throat, a very bad case of it due to not eating. I tell her that I'm home, that I'll take care of her and we can talk as I do. She agrees upon my insistence.

The next five days were... a blur. The first day, her brother tells me to leave her alone. He says she needs space, and I have to let her have it. I agree, but go up to see her anyway. I tell her that I'll just fold up and put away the clean clothes that took up most of her bed-space and then I'll leave. She says, Well... I thought you were going to just... kind of hang out here all break. My broken heart finds some tape. I care for her for all five days, never leaving her side except to get her food. On the second day, we hug. She clings lightly to me as I break it off. A few hours later, as I'm going out to get food, she tells me to hurry back. I literally skip to my car. On the third day, we kiss. I surprise her with it, but it is long and satisfying. The same day, we have sex. We end up doing so every day following. On the fourth day, I tell her I'm going to give her the space she wanted. I've made plans with my friends, so she can have her time. She blushes as she tells me she wants me to stay. I'd never felt so happy to hear anyone say anything in my life. By the fifth day, we had achieved complete normalcy. It felt real, and I realize that the depression I fall into every semester is because I miss my girlfriend (FUCKING DUH). I swear to her, the day that I leave, that so long as we still love each other I will do anything and everything in my power to prove to her, every day, how I feel. I meant it. She tells me she loves me dearly, wants to be with me, and regrets what she did. She tells me she's still confused, but she knows that she still loves me.

I go back to school, but things are still not right. When she and I were talking about what happened, after I came home, I told her that if she and I were going to stay together she'd have to text the guy and make it known to him that what he did was very much not right and that she did not want to see him anymore. She resists, even though I bring it up over and over and she agrees it is a good idea. She still hesitates. When I press and pry, I get from her that she's uncertain of what's going to happen. I ask her if she loves him, she says no. I ask again, demanding and begging for honesty, she says no. I ask her if she's still interested in him, and her silence is my answer. I ask why, how? She doesn't know, he's just nice. I say, Nice? Nice?! This guy saw that you were fucking wasted drunk and took advantage of you with no regard to your feelings. This guy does NOT respect you, clearly, and this guy is a fucking scumbag. Nice?! She says he's nice to her, and I say, You know he's fucking at home right now jerking off to you? He's nice to you because you're pretty, sweet, play awesome video games and are approachable. Being nice to someone doesn't make you a nice person, and what he did definitely makes him not a nice person. She tells me she understands, but she can't help it. I tell her that's a chemical infatuation, obviously. She agrees. Still, no text sent. I let it sit for a while, say nothing for some time, until one particular night. 

I was at work when I remembered that she still had his number in her phone, they were friends on Facebook and she'd changed her account password recently, I have a panic attack in the middle of making a customer's food. A bad one. I barely get through the work-day, having to take time in the bathroom to silently sob, and frantically call her when I get back. I needed her, not just to confirm or deny my suspicions, but to be there for me. She had fallen asleep. The whole night, I'm awake and deeply distressed. At 8am, I get ahold of her. She is distant, hesitant to talk, not willing to help me through one of the sharpest slopes of depression and anxiety I'd ever had in my life. I'm literally shaking, feeling physical pain with no physical reason, crying uncontrollably, I'm a mess. Finally, when I get her on the phone again, I explain what I'm feeling. Finally, she gets it. I didn't need any answers, I just needed to talk. I just needed to be heard. She feels terrible, tells me she wants to be with me and there for me, and we confirm our feelings for each other. During a screaming match, before that conclusion, I bring up the guy's number to her. She deletes it, at least tells me she does, but never sends him that text message. They're still friends on Facebook. She swears she has not spoken to him, or really to anyone much at all since she's been sick (strep became tonsillitis, tonsillitis became something different that she's still struggling through. Little food intake, high stress level, low physical comfort. Not in good shape). I believe her, and force myself to avoid demanding her Facebook password.

So that's where we are now. We alternate from intimate and loving to distant and uncertain since I came back to school, sometimes in the same day, and still I have things to talk to her about. I don't know what's going to happen. Honestly? I'm scared shitless. I never realized how much she meant to me until there was a chance she might have to mean nothing to me forever. We'd talked about marriage and a future together before, but never before had I been so certain it was what I wanted. I'm still in bad shape, barely struggling through finals week, and every day that she and I are not near each other is another day that my stress about her doubles itself. I can't sleep most nights, I force myself to eat, I find no joy in any of my hobbies. I want nothing more than to hold her again. I feel like it's beyond worth noting how much she means to me. I can't actually describe it well enough, I'm finding, to feel like the message gets across. She literally means the world to me, she and I are scary (and I mean scary, used to scare the hell out of me) compatible. We love almost all of the same things, and the only things we differ on are tiny and insignificant. I'm worried, no, terrified that I may lose my best friend, my confidant, my lover, my partner, the greatest thing that's happened to me, the most beautiful woman in my life, because of distance. I'm perfectly willing to give up my schooling and come home to her, but she tells me that's too much pressure. 

So I'm taking the semester off instead. She claims that she wants me to make my plans without considering her, so I figure that's exactly what she's doing now (in fact, I'm 100% certain. She's practically said so herself). My good friend, and our mutual friend, told me to let her go. That she and I are way too compatible with each other to not stay friends and not get back together. I tell him that's a bullshit excuse to let someone get away. I tell him, and her, that if she and I are done then we have to be done. Even trying to think about seeing her and knowing that she's not mine and I'm not hers sends me into a heavy depression. I don't want to be her friend if we separate. Guys are, quite literally, constantly falling in love with her. She's gotten love notes, presents, constant attention, and more from all kinds of guys (honestly, mostly beta guys. She's nice to everybody the same way, but these guys will always and without a doubt interpret it as more than that. Every time) throughout the years we've been together. She's honestly an awesome girl, my perfect girl, and there's no way she won't get snapped up again quick. There's literally a backlog of guys who she was friends with who have admitted their love to her. These guys are like freaking hyenas, lapping up every chance they get to compliment her or say something nice to her (Facebook is usually how, since she stops hanging with guys when they tell her they love her and want her to leave me). At least one of them, bare minimum, will get his day if she and I split. I can't stand the thought. I'm a damn good looking guy, to be more honest with myself than I usually am, so I know I could find another girl, too. I don't want another girl. I never wanted another girl since she and I got together.

I think that's what makes this so painful; she wanted another. I've never felt that, never been there, though she has twice. The other time, which I found out about months later, was a coworker she became infatuated with. He liked her too, and they worked together all the time. She didn't tell me, and I found out accidentally far after he had transferred stores and found a girlfriend. That kind of stuff worries me. It makes me think she's definitely lying about other stuff, especially since it took so much damn hard work to get her to tell me (what I don't even think is) the full story of that fateful night. I'm frayed at the edges right now, completely uncharacteristic of me, and constantly either weighed down with depression or burning with anxiety.

So that's my story. Shit's all fucked around in my head and heart right now. I know this is terribly long, and to be honest I may end up deleting it since it's so detailed and my girlfriend does use reddit. I just needed this, to be honest, to write this all down and see what other people think. Thank you for your time if you read the whole thing.


tl;dr My girl got more drunk than most people ever get and a guy kissed her, she didn't hate it. We're dealing with it, and I'm losing my fucking mind over it.

23493,Dating,28w7x0,"So I've been hooking up with this guy, let's call him Ryan, on-and-off since November. Ryan is very much my type physically, and we've had a history of drunkenly hooking up on multiple occasions. In February Ryan started getting more serious, taking me out on dates and expressing that he has considered us 'dating'. I was wary (he's got a terrible track record with girls) but figured we were already good friends and hooking up so it would be fine. I was wrong and he lived up to the reputation that precedes him. It became clear the only thing we really had in common was that we were attracted to one another and liked to drink.

 We stopped talking for over a month, and I ended up spending a lot of time with his friend 'Eric' due to all of our mutual friends. Eric is not really my type physically, and I only knew him in a group setting so we had never really spent a lot of time together and I never really thought about him as more than a cool acquaintance. Unfortunately for me, Eric and I have almost everything in common (our upbringing, interest in books/movies, hobbies, etc) and we ended up spending most of our time just me and him. It became clear pretty quickly we were developing feelings for one another, and so Eric began avoiding me. In the time he avoided me Ryan and I were at a party, got drunk, and ended up hooking up again. It meant nothing to me but Ryan kept insisting he missed me and wanted to try again, completely unaware that I now had a huge crush on his friend. I, stupidly, decided to spend more time with him, assuming Eric was avoiding me because he had been pursuing another girl (Ashley) and it had been going well. I was actually happy for Eric, as I care about him and his happiness is important to me, and I figured this helped keep things from getting too complicated.

Ryan and I have been talking/fooling around for about a week until a few nights ago when we had another talk and yet again it became clear this was solely a physical relationship and nothing genuine would ever come from it. We decided we would try to be platonic friends and give each other space and, because my life is a joke, I ended up seeing Eric that night and hooking up with him. Eric confessed he had been avoiding me as to not deal with how he felt about me, and he hadn't even thought about Ashley since we began spending time together. Eric and I both acknowledge we genuinely care about one another and would like to pursue a 'real' relationship, given how much we have in common and that we find each other attractive and enjoy each others company, but it's clear he doesn't trust me or my intentions and I can't blame him for that.

I feel absolutely terrible about the whole thing, and although I've technically done nothing wrong they're good friends and likely going to move in together when their independent leases end in the fall. Eric has made it clear he feels guilty and doesn't know what to do and I hate that we're in this position. I told Ryan I need time away from him and plan on doing the same with Eric. Ryan has been messaging me saying he misses me and was worried about me because I've been quiet the past few days and I know if he finds out he's going to completely lose his shit. Eric has been messaging me whenever he goes out and saying that I should've joined him on these outings, and we actually have plans to see a comedy show tomorrow but I don't know if I should still go with him (these plans were made before anything had happen between us). I don't see any other real solution that doesn't destroy friendships. I guess I'm just looking for confirmation that I'm doing the right thing to help strengthen my resolve. I'm not this kind of person, I hate that I come off as someone who can't make up her mind and is playing games with these guys, and I don't want any part in it any more. I'm sure I'm going to get called a slut or whatnot for this, and I guess part of this post is because I feel I deserve that.

**Edit to clarify:** I consider hooking up to be making out/fooling around but not necessarily sex, and I have only had sex with Ryan in the period we were 'dating', not this most recent time or at all with Eric. I didn't think this was a large factor (I'm in college in a large liberal city and am sex-positive, I guess this is pretty close quarters so its different) but I figured since it keeps coming up I should mention it

23495,Breakups,3f4adn,"My ex and I broke up almost a month ago.  We had been together for a year and a half and we were friends the same amount of time before we dated so there’s a lot of history between us.  We lived together for about a year.  Let me preface this by saying that he’s not a bad person; he’s done so much for me and if I were to list out all of the amazing things he’s done for me I’d run out of room in this post. I say this because the way he broke up with me and the way he treats me now doesn’t make him look good.  But he’s not some asshole ex.  He’s my best friend and we’ve admitted that we’ve never loved anyone else the way we love each other.    


He did it through a really long email on my birthday while I was on vacation with my family.  Basically what it said was that because we were living together he felt like he was married and that this domestic lifestyle was not for him.  He moved out of our apartment before I even got home.  When I did come home he helped me move my stuff out of our apartment and into my new one; we both still live in the same complex, but in separate apartments.     
 

The problem is that he still treats me like a girlfriend even though he’s made it clear he doesn’t want exclusivity.  He still tells me he loves me and when we hang out (which is still pretty much every day) we still kiss and snuggle and I even sleep over about three days a week.  But he still is talking to other girls online just to see where it goes.  He told me that it’s not that he’s looking for something better than what we had, he just wants something different.  He’ll never know if I’m truly who he wants to be with until he’s been with other people.     


There’s two sides to me.  One side wants to stay in this pretend relationship and hopes that he’ll date other people and will come back to me with a realization that I am the one he wants.  I mean he still treats me the same.  Not all that much has changed between us with the exception of moving out and not being exclusive, otherwise our relationship feels the same as it did before.  We've even said how there will probably always be feelings between each other.  But the other side wants to drop all contact with him because I know what I want and that’s him and I don’t want to wait around and watch him date other people while I twiddle my thumbs hoping that he’ll realize that I’m who he wants.  I don’t want to waste my time on him if he’s not going to come back.     

 
But I still love him very much.  It breaks my heart that he still treats me like his girlfriend but doesn’t want me as his girlfriend.  But it also breaks my heart thinking that if I cut off contact with him, I’ll never know if I’m who he wants because I would have moved on. I know that he’s not necessarily using me because I can see it in the way he looks at me and talks to me that he still cares a lot for me.  He’s just very conflicted with what he wants, that’s what he always tells me.

23496,Dating,3970lz,"Okay, I could use some advice on my situation. Basically I've started to get feelings for this girl that I work with. She started working at this company about 2 weeks before I did and we have been working here for over a year now. When I started working, she had a boyfriend. My feelings first started in a joking matter with one of my friends/colleagues that I work with. But over time they grew more and more real. Her and I have been having lunch together on about a daily basis for at least 6 months I would say. About 2-3 months ago she broke up with her boyfriend. At this point we are still having daily lunches together, and she hadn't been showing interest in dating again.

Fast forward to now, she is ready to go out again (I know this because she told my friend/colleague). So I decided on a Wednesday after work to ask her to have dinner with me on the weekend. She told me that she was too busy this past weekend to have dinner and said maybe next weekend. Today is after that weekend and ever since I asked her she seems to be putting a bit of distance between us. We still have lunch together, but we seem more apart than before.

I'm not sure if I should ask her again now or just see what unfolds. Sometimes I get the feeling that she is just trying to avoid it but other times she does seem into me. This really confuses me. If she's not interested, I would rather her just say no so I can move on.

So there's been a girl in one of my classes, I started to form an interest in her somewhere around Thanksgiving or so. I didn't actually decide to make an effort to do anything until January or February. Well in March she actually started a conversation with me one day asking if I had met her aunt, this will become relevant later as her aunt and my mom are friends, I told her I had and we had a short conversation.

Well I got her number a week later, the last day before spring break, over spring break we texted quite a lot and I thought things were going well. I was trying to get into a position where I would be comfortable asking her out. I nearly got my chance when she asked if I was going to a dance which I said I likely was, well with my luck I fell ill and missed the dance.

When I came back she asked me how I was feeling. I told her that I was doing a little better, and I accidentally walked away, I felt bad about it and apologized later that night. Well I texted her the next day, no response. So I texted her the day after that, no response. I figured she didn't want to talk to me so I stopped making an effort.
It was two weeks before she texted me apologizing for the long absence, citing studying for AP exams and getting a new phone. I forgave her and we communicated a little over the next few days but it felt far more awkward than before.

There was another lapse in texting a week long actually but we had a brief conversation by text. I was distraught at times by the lapse, as evidenced by my other posts on reddit, but for the most part I was a little saddened but fine. The feelings about it would come and go. 

Well that was all good until early June. My mom and her aunt had lunch, my mother and her aunt apparently discussed me and the girl I'm interested in. My mom found out that the girl I like felt her and I really hit it off and she was at the very least interested in me. But she had doubts because I was too awkward to regularly talk to her in person. So I texted her trying to apologize for it because school was already over and as soon as it was over I had gone on a month long vacation. She told me I should have apologized in person but that it was alright. The conversation died soon afterwards, well it's been three weeks since then and I haven't talked since.

I went through an incredibly nasty break-up a few months ago with my first love/first relationship. We had been incredibly close for the majority of the year and a half that we were together, but things began to fall apart quickly within the month leading up to our split. While I was already heartbroken, my ex added insult to injury by immediately leaping into a relationship with a girl I strongly dislike, and telling me that I never meant anything to him, and merely served as a placeholder for the relationship he wanted with her. 

It took me a few months to get out of the break up phase where I was constantly crying and mourning the relationship. I've pretty much gone through every stage of grief, removed him from all of my contacts and social media, and stopped thinking about him almost altogether. The problem is that I'm finding it incredibly difficult to move on from the relationship comfortably because my family and friends are routinely engaging me in discussion about the split, and the girl that he's dating. It makes me extremely anxious to discuss, and brings back all of the painful memories from this summer. They always ask me about my ex, whether his new girlfriend is still in the picture, and what he's doing with his life, despite their knowledge of me cutting him (and his friends) off. My mom is particularly bad about this, and many of my close [male] friends have cut me out of their lives in favor of him... while keeping myself and my family in their contacts. Naturally, my family sees pictures of my ex and my former friends spending time together and begin to ask me what the deal is. 

I've told everyone time and time again that discussion  surrounding my ex, his new girlfriend, and our split bothers me a lot and hinders my healing, but they just refuse to listen. I had considered myself pretty far ahead in the process, going out with friends, enjoying myself and the like, but no matter how far I thought I was, their interference sets me back and I feel the pain all over again. What can I do to heal despite this?

23523,Dating,1kafs1,"So this is a really weird situation for me and I'm really unexperienced with dating since I've always been in long term relationships (which is another issue and really not helping). I hope someone can give me a little insight. 


I met him [30M] shortly after a breakup. We got along quite well but I never even considered that there was anything more as I wasn't attracted to him. He stayed in contact, part out of necessity and part, I guess, because we got along well. He asked if I wanted to hang out one day and I said yes because I thought he was a nice guy. At this point I was getting worried because I wasn't sure if he meant as a date or really just to hang out. The way we met suggested more of a friend situation so I thought I'd just say yes and see what happens. 



The first time we saw each other again was with a few of his other friends around so I got the impression he wanted to be friends and it made me extremely happy. The second time he asked me out for dinner. I was just going to pay for myself to make sure it was clear that I wanted him as a friend. 


But this did not work out. We got along great, we had an amazing time, we both got pretty drunk and he refused to let me pay for anything all night. Anyway, my stupid drunk mind thought that even though I wasn't attracted to him in that way yet, maybe if he was such a nice guy I should give him a chance. We kissed. It all felt really awkward for me and when it progressed at his flat I chickened out and left. 


We saw each other a few times after that and he tried again. I freaked out again and finally told him I couldn't do this and wanted to be friends instead. He said he wants more but if he doesn't get a choice he will be my friend because that's better than loosing me.


Everyone kept telling me that he will keep trying and they were right. He was really respectful in the beginning but now he's starting to touch me again and it's always just us two hanging out and it always feels more like he's asking me on dates (it's always dinners, movies, etc.). 


The problem here is that I just don't know if I should just try again. Because I really, really like him. He's incredibly intelligent and interesting. I feel like we get along so well and he understands me. I love spending time with him. I do find his personality incredibly attractive. But sexually...it just doesn't feel right. When he touches me I don't mind at all. It's just when we go further it always feels wrong. When I mentioned that I wanted to be friends instead he said that I should just give it a try because otherwise I'll never know. I'm not sure if I should or even if I could. I'd rather just be friends but I think I need to accept that this won't happen. And sometimes I start to think about how it would be if we were really dating. It's not a bad thought at all - I just can't imagine the actual sexual part of it because I'm sooo unsure. 


Is there any chance at all that I could feel differently about him? That I get past the initial awkwardness when kissing etc. and that I'll get more comfortable?


Additionally, I probably shouldn't date at all. I have so many issues and so many things going on. He is so understanding but at the same time he seems to have soooo many issues himself.

Was with my ex for 5-6 months, he'd moved in, along with all his stuff. When we broke up, he moved 75 miles away, but neither of us have a car and he didn't have any space to put it, so it got left here. I went no contact when I heard he was seeing someone else, at which point he'd already left his stuff in my house for 2 months because he had no money and nowhere to put the stuff still.

We've now been NC for about a month, and I've been really good about not checking up on him on social media or texting him or anything, but I do want to get his stuff out of my house, and he has a laptop of mine that I'd like back.

Thing is, I don't really want to talk to him at all, because I'm still hurting a lot over the split and I'm still angry and miss him, so I don't want to stir anything up - but I don't want this to go on forever, because I feel a bit like I'm being used. I have no idea if he has money or space yet, however I'm really starting to feel like this is just not my problem anymore and I want rid of the stuff so I can move on properly. It's really painful walking around my house, and not only do I keep tripping over it, it all smells like him, so I'm stuck in a sense memory nightmare.

I haven't blocked his email or phone number, so if he really needed it back, he could have asked by now, which is why I'm feeling a bit like I'm being used as a storage facility at the moment.

(FYI: It's a lot of stuff - some furniture, several computers, 5 large holdalls of clothes and shoes, around 200 books, 3 boxes of cables/wires, 2 guitars, some speakers, a large TV and 8 smaller bags of random assorted crap - so I can't move it myself and it's taking up a lot of space)

He was great in bed and gorgeous.  He caught me sexting another guy while I was with him, total shame on me. I accept that. Fallout was, he left and hated me.  

I was able to win him back and he had me promise not to sext other guys while I was with him, to which I totally agreed.  He agreed to do the same.  Then I found out he had been sexting and sending videos to girls from my house even after making that promise.  In fact, he had never stopped talking to any girls, even though he had me promise.  I was pissed, but I kind of let it go, calling it even.

He's been great lately, seems very focused on me, but I can't help this feeling that he's probably texting other girls and he says I can go through his phone whenever, but I don't want to.  I mean, I do, actually, because I want to believe him, but I shouldn't have to because I should trust him.  He told me his phone wasn't locked and then I tried looking at it and it was.  This morning his phone went off with my text tone, but I didn't text him. So who did?  Do I ask him?  Or is it just always going to be like this?

23553,Infidelity,3d02sw,"In May, I caught a tramp on top of my fiancee in his car. Yes, she is a tramp because she knew we were getting married, as she was invited to the wedding by both of us because I thought she was a decent person before. My fiancee and I have been together for 2 1/2 years, and engaged since September 2014. My fiancee told me that they just made out, and later told me that she was rubbing on him as well, but she has been going around telling everyone they had sex. His excuse? He was drunk and I pushed him to do it. This incident was 4 months before our wedding, invites have already been sent out and all of those nonrefundable deposits have been paid for, so I have been completely mind fucked, and well as a complete mess.

So for the past few months we have been trying to work things out and pursue on with the wedding. Unfortunately, I have become a very insecure, paranoid, and jealous bitch ever since I caught him. We fight practically every other day about pity bullshit instead of just talking to each other. I can see him become more and more exhausted with our relationship, as he has been spending a noticibly larger amount of time away from me. I have also been scared to react or respond to him in certain ways because I fear that he will find another girl and tell her how miserable I make him. (yes, that is exactly what he texted the tramp a few days before I caught him cheating on me.) Our relationship hasn't been at all the same since, but I guess I should have never expected it to be. 

We are about a month away from our wedding, and I am still having my doubts. Actually, I have been having a large amount of anxiety and fear that he is going to cheat on me again, drunk or not. 

My fiancee has told me multiple times that I need to choose what makes me happy. You know what would make me the most happy? If I never ever had to witness the awful sight of my supposed soulmate jamming his tongue down some other girl's throat, all while being blamed for it. 

So people of Reddit, what would you do? I have reached my breaking point and I have no idea what to do anymore.

23554,Dating,307ndr,"My friend (female) recently turned 16, let's just call her Jasmine. I'm 19 and a guy. I know at first glance this might seem weird that we're friends but we're part of a wider group with 20-30 people in it aged from about 16 to 21, Jasmine is probably one of if not the youngest in the group. I'm not close with all of the people in the group (some I am very close with but others I dont really talk to and are just 'there'), but i'm close with Jasmine because of some (unrelated to this) stuff that happened a couple of years ago which brought us together. I'm not nor have I ever been in a relationship (or even really had any feelings) with Jasmine, just clearing that up.

Anyway, there's a guy in the group who's nearly 21. Let's call him Dave. I'm not close with him, i've spoken to him a couple of times and as judgemental as it sounds he just seems really weird, to put it bluntly. Dave is quite socially awkward and shy, and seems uncomfortable talking to new people. From what I gather he has no job, no drivers' licence and doesn't go to college or anything. Dave spends most of his life gaming, watching anime and collecting figurines, he is also physically overweight and has bad acne. I'm guessing you get the picture. How exactly he came into our group i'm not sure, I think he was school friends with someone who ended up bringing him along to stuff.

Anyway, Dave has beeen really creepy towards Jasmine recently. And before anyone comments that 'you're only saying that because he's unattractive', if an attractive 21 year old was doing and saying similar things to Jasmine i'd think it was creepy too. Jasmine is quite insecure about her looks (for what it's worth I think she's cute as do others) and Dave seems to exploit that. Whenever she posts a picture on Facebook Dave always makes a comment about her being beautiful, gorgeous etc. Now I have no problem with him trying to make Jasmine feel less insecure but to me it just seems a bit creepy that a guy 5 years older than her is making these comments repeatedly. He also messages her a lot, which she replies to out of politeness but makes it subtley known (through short responses) that she's not interested in talking. Also, Dave always asks Jasmine to hang out with him after she finishes school at the local shopping mall, which she declines, saying she's 'busy', but then Dave gets all sad and complains that she's always busy. The final straw came the other day when Dave came into the store where Jasmine works at the end of her shift (she'd told him she was working and when her shift was) with Dave feigning surprise and claiming he 'forgot' she was on and that he just came in to get a burger (it's a small takeaway/fast food place). Jasmine talked with him and he told her that he really liked her. Jasmine didn't really respond to that (she's too nice to get angry) and they continued talking until Jasmine lied about her mum coming to pick her up and that her mum was protective so he should leave.

Jasmine is totally lost as to what to do in regards to Dave. She's too nice and non-confrontational to flat out get mad at him but she's pretty creeped out by his behaviour and afraid of him showing up at her work again. What should she do here?

My friend and I have known each other since 2009 and worked with each other for 2 years before I went to grad school and she continued to work at the company we had worked for together. We began as work colleagues both in lower leadership and in our early 20's. We also went to the same high school, though we didn't know each other then, but we share a lot of memories from the same place so it brought us closer together. I also was the main catalyst for her and her fiance's beginning of their relationship because I am friends with him as well and he works for the same company she does and I use to. 

Other than highschool and the company I use to work for (both her and her fiance still do) I really have nothing in common with her, on top of this they live in another state and we don't see each other very much. 


* The juicer part*
 December 2013 they got engaged and I was very happy for her and we celebrated in our normal early 20 something way of drinking and eating too much. There has been some disagreement of this, but from my memory she asked me to be a Bridesmaid and I said I would love to be there for her in other ways but I didn't want to be negative during her process since I really dislike wedding things. She pitched a fit and called me a bad friend so I told her I would do it, knowing how she is and I was agreeing to something way down the line because she wasn't about to start actually planning a wedding then.  

Fast forward to this summer, my husband and I have been in another state from them for the past 2 years and when we visit Florida we visit with them, so we've seen each other about 8-12 times since this. I made a comment that she should start planning her wedding and I was actively helping her plan things for about 6 weeks before we blew up. I made a joke about being strong-armed into being a Bridesmaid and she unmaid me (whew!) things were said, we both hurt each others feelings.

She just isn't the person I thought I was becoming friends with, and I don't know how to say that to her without shitting all over her life. When we were younger we talked about what we wanted to do; school, work, travel etc. all 4 of us (Me,hubby,her,her fiance) but now she wants to stay with that same company and have kids and live in the same state and basically be the very person we use to say we would never be. 

I know people change and grow, and that's okay but she still sees me as a close friend and when I don't answer her calls or try to distance myself I know how much it hurts her and I don't want to hurt her anymore, but I don't want to be close friends with her anymore either. 

To top it all off, because during our argument I mentioned she never has come to visit me in the 2 years out of state even though we have come several times a year that she was a shitty friend so she bought tickets for both of them to come in September. 

I'm dreading this visit, I want it to be as positive as possible so she doesn't have any ill feelings toward our friendship or us since I do care about her and want her to be happy.

23559,Breakups,3ao1tm,"I broke up with my ex boyfriend of 1.5 years about a week ago. Since probably December, his feelings for me  and personality have flip flopped multiple times. In December he became very reclusive, started doing drugs, accused me of not loving him, and threatened suicide. We had multiple conversations about all his feelings, but I would ultimately be blamed for his unhappiness. Like he would literally  say, Maybe you're the reason I'm so unhappy. Sadly I stayed by his side the whole time ( I regret it), putting my life on hold and doing whatever I could to make him happy. It's embarrassing, but I started to believe that I was actually the problem. 

A couple months later he decided that his life was  all figured out. He was working more, planning more for his education, and his future. However, I was completely torn apart emotionally from trying to keep him afloat. I think by this time, in my head, I was done, but I was too scared to initiate a break up. With his newfound sense of confidence, he felt the need to insult family and try to isolate me from from them, made me feel bad when we didn't have sex, and was still very closed off emotionally. There is so much more I can write about his controlling, narcissistic behavior but there is too much.

OK fast forward to a week ago. Long story short, I came home to my entire neighborhood with the power out at 11 pm. I was home alone and apparently I'm deathly afraid of power outages. I went to my car pretty freaked out, and called him and a couple friends hoping somebody would sit with me for a little bit. My friends didn't answer but he did. He refused to come over saying that  it is weird you are still afraid of the dark and it's too late. I think being so scared and emotional in that moment plus all the negative emotions that were building in our relationship caused me to break, and I told him to not call me the next day. Two days later all my stuff was on my porch, including photos of us, letters I had given him, everything. I felt so free and relieved that the relationship was done. 

So finally to the point of this post lol. Yesterday this ex texted me saying he wanted to talk about what we did wrong in our relationship. I told him that I didn't want to talk to him, and that I didn't need to be insulted, put down, or interogated by him anymore. He replied saying that I was selfish and insecure and that  he deserved to get his feelings off his chest. He said that I hurt him badly. I know this conversation wouldn't be about closure, it would be about him getting his power back and making me feel like crap. He has no intention in getting my side of the story, and even if I tried to communicate my feelings with him I know how it would end, like usual, with me being the bad guy and him being misunderstood. When I didn't reply to his texts he would keep texting me hello? and even when I told him this was not the time to talk, he tried pressuring me into giving him a date to talk. He asked me if  I was scared of understanding him. I replied I was more concerned about myself at this point. Plus, I have been trying to understand this guy for months while being denied any sort of communication or emotional openess. The time to  understand him in my opinion has passed.  I am done with this guy. I am happy without him, and am working on my own happiness, confidence, and goalS. I have blocked his number on my phone. Is it wrong of me to not talk to him anymore and deny him this meeting, or am I still being manipulated?

We had a pretty huge discussion, he let me talk for a long time. I may or may not have had prepared bullet-points. Champion that he is, he addressed every single one satisfactorily. He confirmed what I already knew: he's not really the type of guy who enjoys the chase. He doesn't like going to clubs, getting drunk, and talking to girls. I know he's not just saying this because whenever I drag him out he always just wants to go home and cuddle. I feel like a weight has been lifted, and I'm even more excited for him to come back. Do I wish this never happened? Of course. Am I going to regret not ending this? Doubtful. Am I going to hold this over his head? Absolutely not.

I need your advice.

So, to make a very long complicated story short…

A few years ago in graduate school, I met a very nice boy (He wasn’t a man, at all haha). We met at a bar (typical) and hit it off pretty quickly. Now, he wasn’t very good at courting me then- but I was smitten, so I didn’t pay much attention. 
We dated in the same town for about 5 months and then he had to move about 45 minutes away (to this parent’s house) for an unpaid internship. (He couldn’t afford the gas to travel from my place every day). 

During this time, he didn’t visit as much as I had hoped- even though I offered him gas $. He said I should come visit him just as much (but I lived alone, and he lived w/ his conservative parents and we had to sleep in a separate room). So this caused some tension.

Then, I took a temporary academic-like position for 8 months about 5 hours north of our town. I got a 2 bedroom and asked him to come with. At this point, we had both finished grad school and he was unemployed. He didn’t come with. He stayed at home and eventually got an on again off again shitty fencing job. This caused a lot of tension. 
So, I was applying to jobs all over the country- but mostly West, as it was our dream to move west by the mountains. He didn’t apply to jobs with me, though.

So, I landed a great job w/ benefits out west. He didn’t come- he landed a job in the same town we had been in. This job required a 2-3 year commitment. And he took it, without asking for a night to think about it…This one hurt. A lot. I felt nauseous. Like I was in love w/ someone that just wouldn’t commit. 

He promised he would come out west after his 2 years- so we stayed together…well, we tried.

I got out here, alone. It was very hard. I had an injury that didn’t allow me to do much all winter and I was very lonely and still really hurt over him taking the job. Eventually, I started to feel like I wasn’t important at all. If we got into a fight, he wouldn’t respond for days- because he was “busy with work.”

So, I couldn’t take it anymore and broke it off (hoping he would see what I meant to him). It backfired. When I caved and said I missed him weeks later, he said he didn’t love me anymore. He told me this via email after 2.5 years together. . . 
So, I was depressed. For months. Sick to my stomach. Lost 12 lbs…etc. But, I moved to a hip city a little further from my job. Made a bunch of friends. Got into new hobbies. And I was REALLY starting to feel happy- but, I still felt empty, a part of me was missing. We really did love each other.

And then, he fucking writes me. The morning after I had an amazing weekend and met someone I think I could really like. 
Now we are talking again and he wants to move out here. He said he realized that he was scared of leaving his home town, his home state, his job, and his family- and he feels sick to his stomach that he hurt me due to his own fears. 

What do I do, Reddit?


A part of me feels like I was on my way to a happy, well-rounded life- and I know I would meet someone who would never take me for granted.

Another part of me feels that if we didn’t have that break up and the time  apart- we both would have kept fighting, treating each other like shit, and it would have been a disaster. (Which is most likely what would have happened- I wasn’t perfect either- by the time things were falling apart, I was such a cunt to him).

23566,Dating,30ruq8,"I'm a white American and have been going out with a Chinese girl from my college class for a little while.  After the third date, we went back to her place and watched a movie on her bed.  We talked about us moving forward and decided to be exclusive. When we were laying down on her bed for the movie, she was holding me and rubbing my chest so I leaned in for the first kiss and we kissed.  I kissed her goodnight that night too, no signs of any problems.

One week later, we're hanging out again and I kissed her maybe 4 more times on her bed.  No tongue, no touching, just kisses.  She then told me she just broke up with her bf of 5 years in January and wanted to take it slow. I told her no problem, I understood and would try to go slow.

Since then, I haven't kissed her or even tried to, and have made a great effort to go slow with her.  She says she feels like she needs space and started to get more distant, wanting to hang out less.  She says if I can't understand her situation we can just be friends.  I texted her apologizing for moving too fast and telling her I wasn't trying to use her, but still no response. 

Its been 3 days. I still have class with her and I still really like her but I don't know what to do now. She's my kind of girl and I don't want to lose her so I really would appreciate any advice.  What should I do from here to get her to give me another shot?

I really like him a lot and have a ton of fun with him. We haven't addressed being exclusive at all, which is where things get confusing for me.

Last weekend I went out drinking with a bunch of friends and met this other guy (25M) (let's call him Luke). Luke and I ended up sleeping together at the end of the night and he stayed over the whole next morning just hanging out and talking. He kept saying he really likes me and had a ton of fun with me and stuff, and I totally felt the same about him. 

Luke texted me last night inviting me to go out with all of his friends. If I wasn't at work, I totally would have gone. I'm really interested in getting to know him more. But that made me question things with Kevin… We haven't addressed being exclusive. I don't know if he's seeing other girls as well, or if after a month he's just assumed we aren't seeing other people? Do I owe it to him to have that conversation, or do I just assume I'm free to see other people until we explicitly sit down and have a conversation about being exclusive? 

I don't want to stop seeing Kevin, but I'm not really ready to dive in to being exclusive and in a relationship yet. He's not really a fuck yes yet if anyone is familiar with that reference. I kind of want to have the freedom to keep my options open, but I want to continue to get to know him better and I hope that the more time I spend with him, he'll become a fuck yes. I don't know if this is a conversation I need to have with him, or if I should just ride it out and keep hanging out until it comes up on its own?

Please offer me some actual advice instead of You shouldn't have gotten into this situation. I already know.

EDIT: There isn't much point in saying walk away that's what I am trying to do.
There also isn't much point in saying own up/call his bluff. That's a risk I can't afford to take.
I have spent a long time agonising over this and I literally need some way to tell her about it so she can stop it, because I can't. If I could I already would have.

Basically I started embarking on an affair with my boyfriend, Brad about 3 months ago. I knew he had a girlfriend (Jo) but things weren't working out between them and she and I had some bad blood so I didn't really care about that at the time. 

Anyway, I decided I wanted to leave Brad about 2 weeks ago and he started blackmailing me, saying he would reveal some information about me to my workplace which would get me fired if I left. 

Because of this I haven't left. in a way he would notice. I don't go on dates with him anymore, making excuses but I still sometimes have sex with him because tbh it's fun and more convenient than finding someone at a bar.

However I am starting to feel like I really want to end this but I can't because I am afraid he will tell on me and get me fired. I know Jo can't stand me and I know she doesn't trust me (with good reason!).

I need to think of some way of telling her about the affair, or making her suspicious about the affair without actually telling her myself and I need to do it some way he won't know it was me.

I thought about emailing her or writing a letter to her but that won't work. He would say it is her psycho ex boyfriend trying to split them up again.

I also thought about leaving obvious scratches or a lovebite on him but that might be too obvious for him, I am afraid of how he would react.

I need something subtle to make her suspicious or to make it clear he is having an affair with somebody. She would probably assume it is me and prevent him from seeing me by threatening to cut off his allowance. (She earns a lot more than he does and owns their house.)
I suppose I need to know how people caught their SOs or got caught while having an affair.

FTR I am *not* trying to split them up. She is way too clingy to leave him but controlling enough if she thought he was having an affair she would prevent him seeing me and that would stop him blackmailing me.

We met when we were 15 and 16 years old and have been BF and GF ever since until this past June. We have been off and on over the past 6 years never leaving each other for more than 2 months hooking up with others during the separation time but always managed to forgive each other and get back together. She was best friends with my mom and her parents also liked me. Her family and I even traveled to other countries together. My friends called us inseparable and people thought we were going to get married one day we even talked about marriage too. However this is where the problems started. 

The thought of Marriage to me at 22 was too much to handle and I had some kind of midlife crisis meltdown. This changed my mood on our relationship completely making me grow more distant and emotionally unstable. My ex also has trust issues and clingy like tendencies from stuff in our past so it made the situation even worse. Eventually things got so bad that we split up in June but remained friends with benefits. We started seeing other people and hanging out with our friends more and grew even further apart, but we always managed to sleep with each other at the end of the night. She slept over at my place every other night. Until the one fateful night in August… I was drinking with some buddies and met a girl who I fooled around with at a bar and she gave me hickeys on my neck (which I did not want).

Yesterday I wrote him a letter telling him how much I loved him and didn't want to lose my best friend because of our relationship etc etc and when he read it when we had a talk last night he agreed wholeheartedly that we couldn't lose our friendship because of a break up.

I would even say that if circumstances were different I could be friends with him. He said that all she talked about was me. He showed me a pic of his new gf.

23592,Breakups,1yr75y,"Hi everyone, I think my boyfriend just dumped me. We've been dating for 4 and a half months, it's nothing I know, but I am super in love with him. We met through an online dating site. Now, I guess I was very naive thinking that I could get a very cute and happy relationship from a place like that. He's my first boyfriend, and a few months ago he told me that he talked to me because he was just looking for sex, and that he used that account to get one night stands all the time. I was a virgin when I met him, and he was also my first (he later told me I was his 15th). The day we met we kissed, and that was just the start of a very very bad relationship. He could never ever do the things right with me, I never got respect from him, neither a little bit of trust. Plus, he said things like, I just haven't dumped you yet, because you're too pretty! Too bad you're a slut, and you'll be a slut your entire life

He said that because of all that, me coming from an online dating site and the fact that we kissed the first day, he can't get our of his mind the idea that I am a complete slut. And he has been calling me that way (also cheater, stupid, bitch, dumb, and more) for the last 3 months. Now listen, I am completely in love with him, and him calling me that way is hurting me a ton, because I AM NOTHING LIKE THAT!

Actually I am a very shy, quiet, awkward girl (that's the reason I used that web page to meet people). He was my first at everything, and he doesn't believe that. He asked me to stop talking to other guys and I did, I don't have any friends and got a ton of problems with my family because of him. He says he doesn't trust women because we're all the same, even though he has never been cheated on. He used to sleep around with everyone and I don't give him grief about it! I accept him the way he is, and I love him just like that, I have never ever tried to change him even though he's super rude to everyone, especially with me. He trusts more what his friends say about me than what I tell him about me! (I talked to his friends for about 30 seconds the other day and because I was too quiet I am a two faced bitch and I'm surely hidding something.

So, he broke up with me last night, told me I was never going to change and I would be a slut my whole life, and that he doesn't want to date someone like me. That he CAN'T LOVE someone like me. I felt terrible and cried all night long, I wake up to a message from him that says Can we still have sex? And I told him NO, because I'd only do it if he were to be my BF, and he told me that just confirmed his decision to dump me, that I would fuck anyone who gets to be my BF. He said Tell Lunarmax she's pretty, get to be her BF, fuck her, use her, dump her. That Lunarmax is how you work. You're a fucking slut Then 3 hours later I got an I love you message from him.

Then asked me to close my fb and open another one where he could be my only friend, that way we can be together again.

What should I do? Am I really a slut, and it's all my fault?!

Edit: Now, a little bit about me. I don't expect you to get to know me this way, but this is the truth of how 
I am, you know, I'm pretty sure I know myself, better than him. I'm a 20 year old girl, I'm a med school student, I'm shy and quiet, I have a fairly low self-steem, I don't like to talk to other people because I feel like I'm bothering. I appreciate the few friends I have (or used to have) because I'm not a very social person. I'm nice and sweet, and loving and caring. I try to make other people happy and help them in any way I can. I don't go out often, I'm awkward, I enjoy books and coffee. And movies and music.

23593,Dating,1h3s1s,"About a year and a half ago, I moved into the halls of residence at university, and met quite a few new people, as you do. Having recently broken up with my last girlfriend, I decided that no matter what, I would not get involved with anyone for the first month there. This was also so I could settle into life away from home. Within a week I had met a girl who I really liked and spent a lot of time with, albeit mostly in a group with a bunch of others.

About a week after this I realised that one of the other guys in the group also liked her, and this became obvious to everyone about a week after that. At this stage I decide to let it go and move on, instead of potentially ruining both friendships and relationships. Over the next few months I become very good friends with both of them, though every so often I wished that I had acted first.

Fast forward about 6-7 months (during which I feel like I'm moving on, though I don't actually date anyone), and the girl is having health issues that put a strain on most of her friendships, very bad timing considering she had just organized a flat with a few of those friends for the next year. A month after that, and she breaks up with her boyfriend (as far as I know, for reasons unrelated to her health). The two of them stay friends with me, and within a couple of months are friends with each other again as well.

During those last couple of months I spent more time than usual with the girl, seeing as she basically needed a friend to be there for her, and despite what several others apparently thought, the thought of asking her out wasn't even in my mind.

Fast forward again to the start of this year, and I realise I still have feelings for her. For a few months I try to put it out of my mind and move on, given that I'm friends with her ex still, and in fact living with him. Over time however my feelings for her got stronger, especially when I spent a lot more time with her, these days I go on walks at night with her a couple of times a week.

As for how she feels about me, it is hard to get a gauge on it. When someone jokes about the two of us getting together (these jokes are pretty common in my group) she usually laughs it off with a not likely, but everyone does that for everyone...As for asking her directly, I'm not exactly the kind of guy to stick my neck out, our situation would make it an awkward conversation unless I was fully prepared to go for it.

And then we arrive at now, when I have no idea what to do or who to talk to about it. Can anyone give me some pointers?

Going to try and give a quick overview. We had been arguing a lot the last two months of our relationship, (Around every 2 - 3 weeks) because we would only skype at night when I couldn't talk much and we'd both be sleepy by that time. I had asked him to spend some time with me during the day (not every day, just once or twice a week) but he's really forgetful and would forget everyday. He'd forget because he'd be busy playing WoW. The day he broke up with me he said he loved me but i didn't make him happy anymore. This completely shattered my heart. We had made so many promises to each other. We had talked about getting married in the future. It hurt a lot that he didn't try and work it out.

I don't blame him for it all. I know I wasn't perfect. I feel like there was more but he didn't say anything else, he just kept repeating himself. I know I shouldn't have, but I did eventually text him and ask him to talk on skype again. All he's been saying is soon.. in a few days. This wednesday he said we'd talk this week, but now it's Sunday and I don't think he'll be texting me.

I don't hate him and never will. I love him and forgive him for this pain he's caused me.

I'm sorry I left out a lot. I tried making it short but if I go into detail it's just a wall text. I'd like to see it from his perspective but I've had no luck. I'm just clueless as to how he's feeling or what he's thinking.

Sure, I can wait. I'm a virgin. No problem. But if it took me three months to get her to kiss me, how much longer will other things take?

This is the longest relationship I've had ever, and would be the first breakup I've been through. I just do not know how to proceed. She has told me that I'm the only happy thing in her life and that is a lot of pressure. If I break up with her, it'll break her heart. I know it will. I've talked to her about all of these problems with no changes. 

I know this isn't too long of a relationship. I'm trying to be mature. 
I just don't know what to do.

23597,Dating,1i8cv1,"I had a sloppy, drunk hook up with a girl I met early on in the past Fall semester at school. After a period of awkward acknowledgement, we slowly became friends over the semester (to be honest, we liked smoking pot together with our friends). A few months later, early in the start of our January term, we hook up again purely out of convenience.  Around this time she tells me she thinks relationships are stupid (drama and whatnot). So great, maybe a friends with benefits situation is what I'm thinking.

I meet a few other girls over the course of the semester, but we were kind of like a fall-back option for each other.  I also didn't want to get too complacent with the situation, so I always remained a little distant to her. Things start to change around spring break though. Both of us ended up in Panama City, staying at separate places close by. We hooked up several times, and I decided to ask her to our fraternity's end of the year beach weekend that was a few weeks later.  I was unsure if I made a good choice asking her, because I felt I was slowly leaving the shallow end for the deep end, relationship-wise (if that makes any sense).

We ended up having a very intimate time at the beach weekend. For the remainder of the school year though, I remained distant with her. She told me later she though I hated her, which wasn't true and I felt bad when she told me this. My reasoning is, the two of us will be part of a 3-week course abroad in January.  I felt like she was leaning more towards a relationship (despite her saying she thinks relationships are bad), because she was wanting to spend more and more time with me, but I wanted to avoid a potentially bad situation down the road, because conventional wisdom says friends-with-benefits never ends well. This explains why I was came off as distant and cold towards her.

Here is where things start to get relevant to my situation as it stands today. We had a discussion about the summer, since both of us were going to be around school for the duration. I told her I wanted to stop hooking up, and explained my reasoning regarding the trip abroad. She agreed with me, but said we could still hook up over the summer. I suppose I agreed, but things were unclear at that point.

Fast forward a few weeks into summer, and I've stopped smoking, doing drugs, eating fast food, and doing every other terrible thing that contributed to my terrible mood (and a big factor as to why I didn't want to spend time with her or hook up with her when she wanted to, I just felt disgusted with myself). I feel fantastic, and I'm excited to see her. We decide that we can keep hooking up over the summer and keep going at it.

My issue is that now, over the course of the summer thus far, I've completely fallen for her - a girl that was once just my sloppy random hook up. I originally didn't want much to do with her, but now I'm having a hard time keeping my mind off of her. Despite us being hook up buddies, for all intents and purposes we're in a relationship. She texts me at least once a day it seems (so she's thinking about me), we cook together, spend a fair amount of time with each other and generally do relationshippy things together.

I'm conflicted because she makes it out like we're still just hook ups when it's clear there's more going on. She also keeps her guard up a bit, for example if I send an affectionate-sounding text she'll kind of put it down, which is the complete opposite of when we're together alone (which is very affectionate). My thinking is that she's conflicted as well (a big part is due to the trip).  We said earlier that we didn't want to hook up beyond the summer, but at this point it seems like we're at a point that would naturally transition into a relationship. This is something I would very much like to do, but the trip will be the big factor that determines the outcome. Based on how great we get along, I think we could make it work over the course of the coming school year without screwing it up, but I'm unsure how to proceed and any advice or wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

**tl;dr**: Had a random hook up with a girl at college. I became friends with her, we hooked up casually a few more times. Then we began hooking up more consistently, and now I think I've fallen for her. At this point we're hook up buddies despite the fact that together we're very relationshippy (though not so much outwardly). We decided earlier that we would stop hooking up at the end of the summer so we can avoid a potentially awkward situation (because friends-with-benefits doesn't end well) before we go on a 3-week trip abroad in January. She seems to be afraid of the thought of a relationship and is guarding herself, even though it's clear we both very much like each other. I don't want things to stop, and I want to make it clear how I feel about things before the end of the summer.

So I've been with my boyfriend for close to two years. We have a son together. The other night my friend came over to hang out and spend the night and drink with me. Well I got the baby to sleep and after we finished eating we drank. Well I made coffee to put the alcohol in and drank half of it and decided to get into my pool with her. We were in the pool for a little bit, got naked and wrapped myself in a towel.

I guess she brought up the fact about every girl thinks about experimenting with another girl and I thought about it too. She then was asking that maybe I was too drunk to do this, but I guess she kept saying that I was sober enough to consent and said it multiple times. I ended up just doing stuff to her, nothing was done to me.

The next morning was very hazy. Once I figured out what had happened and she left I felt this huge guilt. It was eating away at me. So I ended up going to his house, we talked about it. He said he was mostly pissed at my friend for taking advantage of me and he is upset as well because I didn't ask him or give him a heads up. He has forgiven me and all we even had make up sex after, and I still have this guilt that is eating away at me and I can't stop it.

I suffer from depression and I've cheated once in the past and we broke up and I tried to kill myself, and honestly I want to kill myself right now. I'm on antidepressants but they won't stop these feelings.

I don't know how to confront my wife about this. I asked the doctor if there is anyway that she could have picked up Chlamydia at work (nurse), but the only way is from sexual contact. I also purchased a fleshlight a few weeks ago and thought that maybe somehow someone used it before I bought it from the store. I am not sure how about to ask her did you cheat on me without blowing up. I want her to admit to it before I have to tell her to get checked for STDs. Thankfully chlamydia is easy to wipe out, and I do not have any other STDs.

At his house while hanging with some friends, around 2 am, they leave the basement and we start hooking up. 

Prior to meeting, we didn't talk that much because when I would text her, 10 minutes of texting go by and she randomly stops. This doesn't make any sense to me. So I figured she doesn't want to talk to me.

The following day (Sunday morning) we have to leave and go back to college. I help her by bringing her backpack out to her car (she stayed over the night, but we slept on different couches) and give her a kiss goodbye. She then says that we have to hang out sometime soon, but doesn't know when because we're about 2 hours away from each other at different colleges. Then we go back to our own colleges.

We texted again today for about 10 minutes then she randomly stopped. The last text I sent was Really?? I didn't know you play the guitar. Then nothing after that. I later see her like a pic on Instagram and then I get sad and all this stupid shit because it's how I get.

Two days ago she came home early and sat me down. She told me that we're breaking up. She told me that she doesn't love me anymore so this is it. I understood that I can't force her feelings so I accepted my fate while crying my eyes out.

I dated my ex for about 1 1/2 years, we ended up breaking up because I was a huge asshole and at the time and didn't know it, I was junior and she was going off to college, so it may have been bound to happen.  

Early this year I was going through a period of depression, my extracurriculars were going awful (Lost about every football game, and had a very poor year in band), and I was slowly realizing that i was very lonely, and had no one that could help me cope, and that I drove away the only person that I could actually feel 100% comfortable with, my ex.  I also began to realize what an awful person I was towards my ex.  This is where she comes in...

She comes over to hang with my little sister (my family was on good terms with her despite me being a total ass).  Eventually she finds out that I'm depressed and comforts me, hugs and etc.  She had a boyfriend so nothing beyond hugs and talking.

Eventually this boyfriend breaks up with here over a text message, and we begin talking again.  Eventually she tells me that the night she came over she really wanted to kiss me, she asked me if I felt the same and I truthfully said yes.  We work out that she is coming to my last home football game, and that we would hang out afterwards.  We get to her dorm after and we make out for a good two hours.  She tells me how much she has missed me (She was still in love with me when we broke up), and I say the same.  At this point I have fallen for this girl again, I talked to her in length about how I have changed, and profusely apologized for everything that I could remember, to this day I still feel awful about what I did.  Before I leave, she says this would be a no strings attached sort of thing, because she doesn't want to rely on any guys right now and she just wants to be with herself.

Fast forward two days, I get a text saying that she met someone and we would no longer be romantically engaged, I was devastated.  We get to talking later in the week and she eventually broke things off with the guy because she realized she still had strong feelings for me.  Then after a few days of talking, I wake up with a text that says I want to have sex with you, I got condoms..  We hook up for the next two nights and everything was great.  

After that we started texting back and forth all day, going on regular dates, and the whole time she kept telling me how happy I make her, and how she's almost said I love you etc.  She's walking the walk and talking the talk, it seemed like we were becoming a thing and would eventually move to being totally with each other again, though she still said she wasn't ready to date anyone.

Then I get the text, I met someone, we need to end being together romantically, do what you need to do.  I was in shock, I put my emotions in a shell and didn't let them out for a good month.  Then they came out and hit me like a brick wall.  I've been so unbearably sad when ever she crosses my mind.  When I think about her, I not only get sad, but incredibly angry that she did what she did, how she made feel from being on top of the world, to sitting on the shit at the bottom.  I can't even masturbate without thinking of her, and when I get so damn angry that I sometimes start to cry.  I can't even walk by her in public without getting this gut wrenching feeling.  A lot of the time I think of how I could try again if they break up (going to the same university as her next year).  The worst thing is that I still feel like a sack of shit for being a total ass to her before we broke up in high school, I don't even know why I was like that.

I have no idea what to do, I know I should get over her and look on to meeting new people next year, but I just don't know.  This is eating me up inside, hell I got sort of drunk for the first time tonight and all I could think of was how awesome it was not feeling sad.

Our mutual friends have always suggested it's something more, but only recently (last fall) did we begin flirting in earnest (or at least, that's when I picked up on it). I started hanging out alone with her on Fridays so I could feel things out for myself. I deliberately avoided using the word date, but yea. Finally, we went to an event on campus which we called a date afterwards. While texting, we expressed mutual interest and decided to see where the next nine months would take us. Why that long?

I received my dream internship offer on the other side of the country, so I'm sitting here on the opposite coast. In September I'll be back for school, and while we've been Skyping somewhat frequently, I'm honestly back to not being sure how I feel about dating her.

My parents come from a conservative South Asian background. They support my decision to not pursue an arranged marriage, but are adamant I only start dating after college. I love my parents, but that's one part of my life they have zero authority over, and I'm respectfully declining to follow their wishes in that respect.

They know this girl and they like her; they also know her parents and are pretty neutral with them. The point is, if I try to strike up a relationship with this girl, I honestly know it'll become a lightning rod for drama in the temple community (hooray for close-knit immigrant communities!). When I brought up the possibility of dating herwith my parents, there was much shouting of too soon!, tears, and thoughts of marriage on their end (which is absurd in my opinion, but perfectly normal in their cultural sense). 

**tl;dr**:   
1) Is it bad this is a major sticking point for me? I don't want my first relationship to have this much tension on both ends.  
2) Do I have my priorities completely misplaced? I've never really dated or been in a relationship, though I think I finally want one.  
3) How do I communicate this to her?  ",Me [20 M] with my friend (interest?) [20 F] - conservative immigrant parents and first relationships,0.0,False,1.0,0.0,1398232031.0,/r/relationships/comments/23qx38/me_20_m_with_my_friend_interest_20_f_conservative/,Romantic

23645,Dating,2gba4o,"I (F/27) recently met a client (M/45) for my job and felt serious chemistry with him (he's single). Even though things were completely professional, it seemed like we just clicked... not to mention I felt very attracted. We have talked and texted daily about our project (completely normal in my field). We will talk briefly about other things and joke around on the same level. But I've noticed that he calls me 'kiddo' in every conversation while using my name when texting.


I have been going crazy trying to figure out if he is attracted to me or if it's all in my head. I think either:




A. He's attracted to me/likes me and it's his way to show endearment while still remaining professional/appropriate in case I'm not into him or until the project is over




B. He sees me as a child and uses that nickname to solidify that he could not see me in a sexual or flirtatious way




C. ???





FYI- the project is almost over and he's a client that lives in another city, so it's not like this is an office romance. I'm meeting with him next week and am not sure how to proceed. I'm attractive, mature for my age, and typically date 5-10 years older. I thought older men usually dig attention from younger women, but I'm paranoid that this is some schoolgirl crush and he would never think about me in that way. Or worse-- that he's calling me kiddo to hint that I'm too young. I just need a better grasp on this for my sanity! 






TL;DR: I'm into an older man and am not sure how to proceed. He calls me 'Kiddo'... does this mean he wouldn't bang me?

23646,Dating,1w98oa,"He's the first guy I've ever had serious feelings for, romantic or otherwise, but that's not really the issue. I don't particularly identify as gay or bi, but I didn't think of myself as straight before, either. Just to be clear off the bat: this is not a post about sexual identity.

Anyway, the details. We'd been friends for a few years, but just started hanging out a lot more a few months ago. Like any good relationship, our bond deepened and over time I started opening up a little more. I was glad to have somebody that I could be close to without being awkward or awkwardly attracted. And then almost overnight I started to have more feelings than I wanted to have for him. I started noticing all the little things that make him an awesome person and someone I wanted to spend more and more time with.

This went on for a while, and I kept acting normally and trying to reinforce the relationship that we already had as brothers-by-choice, hoping that if I said it enough it would become true in my brain. It didn't, and kept growing until I couldn't ignore it anymore. The problem was that he's 100% straight, not interested in guys or in changing his stance. Despite knowing that I had a snowball's chance in hell of getting into a relationship with him, the feels kept on coming.

Of course, inflaming matters was the fact that this is the first time in over 6 years that I've felt more than a passing interest in someone. I guess you could say that I don't get attached easily. It's a good feeling, and not one that's easy to let go of.

Eventually though I couldn't take the internal pressure anymore, and I told him how I felt a few days ago. I knew how it was going to go, and got rejected (very gently and conscientiously) per anticipations. I made sure that he knew also that I'd be willing to take as much time and go slowly in feeling out a relationship if he wanted to try to expand his comfort zone for the sake of being with someone, but that was a last-ditch effort and was also shot down according to my expectations. I guess I finally hit the point of knowing that deluding myself wasn't going to accomplish anything, and that getting rejected was better than harboring feelings that would only get crushed harder when he *did* find someone else.

I don't know, I just don't know what to do with myself from here. It's not like these feelings just come and go as I tell them, and I don't want to cut one of my best friends out of my life entirely so that I can get over my attraction to them. But I also know I can't just reinstate the previous status quo - even if I could make myself be ok with that, it's not like I can wipe the memory out of his brain. Even though he's really chill about everything and we can interact normally when we're in a group with our other friends, I feel like I'm going to lose one of the people closest to me and there's nothing I can do about it. Part of me also wants to keep hoping he'll change his mind someday, and would probably hold out irrational hope right up until he's saying his wedding vows 10 years from now. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with this situation I've created.

23649,Dating,1rsicp,"We are both college students. Our age difference is 1 year and a few months.

1. I like her. In October, she told me she liked me, but she said, but i think i will fail all of my tests if i follow it through.
2. She is unwilling to commit to a relationship because there is too much schoolwork.
3. She feels guilty because she thinks I'm screwing over my own schoolwork as a result of being madly in love with her. After I spent some time helping her with her project, she said, i can't live with myself knowing that you're screwing yourself over for no good reason.
4. She has many friends who are male (being in computer science, most people in class are male). Some of them are very clearly interested in her. She doesn't want to lose these friends and frequently hangs out with them or studies with them. These include: a guy named **L**, and a guy named **N**. 
5. **L** sometimes gets... touchy... with her. He would sit _really_ close to her, or sit behind her and play with her hair, and so on. He would grab her jacket, bury his face in it, and inhale deeply. He follows her everywhere. She has mentioned that she found L to be clingy and annoying, but nonetheless invites him to social events (such as a dinner), and asked him to help her learn a new programming language. L once mentioned that, if she got a boyfriend, he would stop being her friend.
6. **N** has a great sense of humour and often succeeds in making her laugh. A few weeks ago, she told me that he told her something that greatly disturbed her. When I asked what it was, she said, i guess because you don't know some things, and it's not my secret to tell you, and, i want you to know, but i don't think he wants me to tell other people. you could probably guess what it is. She gave me the opportunity to ask one question which she would answer truthfully, so I asked, Does the secret involve a third party? to which the answer is not really. hmm. Also, she said, if you ask him what happened, i will be really unhappy with you. The previous night, she posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/pNHW5W3.png) on her tumblr, and then deleted it the next day. Anyway, after that it was as if nothing had happened and she was friends with N just as before. The week after next week, she is going to watch a movie with N and another guy because it's N's birthday. I wasn't invited since I have lots of final exams at that time (actually she does too, and so does N) and apparently they had been planning this for a long time.
7. There was one time she needed to stay overnight on campus. Since I live in a studio apartment on campus, I offered to let her stay in my room; but she declined on the basis that it would be suggestive. So I lent her my blanket and she proceeded to in the computer lab, where there was a couch. It was a lab that only L could access, and there was a chance L was staying overnight there too. She asked me if I would feel uncomfortable if she slept there with L. I said yes, and she asked if I would feel better if she also invited N. I think L didn't end up sleeping there with her though, and neither did N.
8. L and N are aware that I like her, but I'm not sure they are aware if she likes me. 
9. At one time I confronted her about L. She said, he insists; and he's my friend, but sometimes i just... i dunno. She then asked what I thought about the existence of some admirers, but then a fire alarm went off at that exact time so I had to evacuate the building and couldn't respond. When I returned, she was no longer online.
10. She is going to do an internship next term and is not going to be taking courses. She has implied that she would have time to start dating then.
11. I'm graduating next May and will probably be leaving the city. There is probably not much chance for a really long term relationship...

Am I being horribly naive? I'm spending a lot of time thinking about this and it's really taxing. The vain travail hath wearied me so sore; I am of them that farthest come behind.

I posted about this relationship previously - specifically, about the plausibility of sleeping with an ex. Heh heh. Welllll....

That was around 3 months ago. We had been dating since September 2013, split in November 2014.

He's a flirt. He struggles with fidelity. What can I say? We had an incident with online stuff, he shared his lifelong conundrum, went to therapy, we gave it a go.

Anyway, after the break-up, we continued to see each other, were affectionate, slept together, still hung out with mutual friends. Were both seeing other people. I finally realized I needed more and cut it off (no big thing, just had to bounce for my sanity). A week of this, he says he misses me and wants to talk.

Sigh. We talk. He wants to make it work, but doesn't really present anything different, so my logical brain says no. A few days later, my heart says yes, and I express myself. He is unsure.

We had an emotional weekend this past weekend. I told him I need a committed monogomous relationship, but obviously, I want it with an excited and enthusiastic partner. I don't want to wrangle him into anything! But, I can't wait for him to get it sorted, which is kind of what he wants (but knows how ridiculous it would be to ask, and so obviously respects my decision to decline haha jeez). I wish I could continue with him casually, but I love him too much to derive any benefit.

Also, I do have other prospects.

However, I'm gutted. I'm deeply attached and am having trouble remaining functional - which is pretty important as I have a rather full and busy life.

I still love and care about her deeply. But it has evolved to the point where it seems that sexual and romantic chemistry is slowing going away. I don't want to hurt her and I enjoy being around her, but something has felt missing for a long time.

It almost feels like I am committed to it because I care for her and we have both made promises and planned our futures around each other. I think that breaking up would devastate her, and my feelings of separation aren't strong enough to end it yet.

I also don't think that we improve each other as people. But I don't know if that is always a realistic expectation in a relationship.

A friend of mine recently said that we work really well together, but he doesn't see very much chemistry between us. Meaning, we communicate so well that we can work through almost any issue, but there doesn't seem to be strong feelings there. I care about her a great deal, but I am not sure if we are romantically the best fit. And it seems weird to be uncertain after almost 5 years.

So anyway, I decided, screw it, even though we had seen each other around I would go introduce myself. I did, and we had a short littlebit akward conversation and that was it. That was wensday. Thursday I went up there for small groups and the girls meet before the guys, so in between we all hangout some and I talked to her a little bit, and then afterwords I saw her on a computer working on something so I went over and said hi and she seemed friendly and didn't mind talking to me.

The school year is winding down so I can't really just take my time, cause when campus is out so is the ministry for the summer and I won't have a chance to see her again if we haven't already gotten to know each other. I MIGHT see her Tuesday but then I'm going to be out of town for a week so there is a chance I won't actually be able to see her much again AT ALL. So, yea.

I don't know what to do, I mean, I'm kinda a blunt person, so preferably, I would just walk up to her and talk to her for a minute or so then say hey you seem cool, do you want to grab some coffee sometime this week, but apparently according to some people, that makes me look desperate (which I think is dumb, but whatever). But the thing is, I may not actually see her in person again soon, but I would really like to talk to her, so, that means I kinda need to do it through facebook, because I won't have a chance to see her again.

Once she asked me a work related question which I answered, and she says something like finally you're good for something.

Another thing is, which I don't know when it started, my eyes sometimes follows her as she gets up and she would make eye contact while she's up. Sometimes I stand up and I look at her and she looks back. Other times I'm coming back to my desk and she glances my way or maintains eye contact with me. She never really smiles when she does this, and sometimes even looks angry. Although I noticed once or twice when we break eye contact she starts smiling as if it's an in-joke between us.

23676,Breakups,3h7i8h,"Hi everyone, it's my first post here.

I fell in love with a colleague of mine about 2 years ago, and we started hanging out and in 3 months time we were official.

At the beginning I was really caring for her, I'd make her honey/lemon drinks when she was ill and deliver it to her university, where she was studying part-time for her Masters. I used to walk her to and from work even though I need to wake up really early and go out of my way. I'd even changed jobs so we could continue working together when she changed company.

Even til this day, I care about her deeply.

However, it was my first relationship (and her 3rd) and there were many times, especially at the start, when I was very immature. I'd throw tantrums until I get what I want, and I was very demanding with her time. We argued over this many times and broke up many times.

Yes - we broke up many times, but soon after always got back together. It's really screwed up I know, and I know you guys will say, as my friends have said many times, that that is many red flags it wasn't going to work anyways.

And soon it turned from just tantrums to me being controlling. I wanted to know what she was doing all the time, who she is having dinner with. There were times when I'd follow her to dinner just to make sure she's not being too innocent and the guy is not actually trying to hit on her.

I had opinions about everything and when she doesn't do what I think was right I'd be angry at her. I'd ban her to go swimming because other guys might look at her sexually. I'd stop her from travelling overseas with friends because she never went there with me first.

Just to be clear, I never hit her or cheated on her, but for me, being that jealous and controlling is not much better.

It's been nearly three months since we broke up. This time when I said I was sorry she didn't take me back. At the time I cried my eyes out, because although I was being a douche, I didn't realise it; in my heart, all I wanted to do was to make her happy, I thought if she did what I thought was right, that she'd be happy. How stupid of me.

Since we broke up, I've had a long hard look at myself, and realised all the douchy things I was doing. I have learnt so much from the relationship, she has definitely made me a better person. But I feel terrible that it was at her expense.

Since the break up, she said she's much happier because she feels more free to do what she likes. I asked her why she doesn't want to be back together, and she said when she thinks of me, all she remembers are the bad times. She used to remember the good, but that's all been used up now. It's bittersweet for me, because I am happy that she's happy, but also sad because I made her sad.

She says she doesn't care about me now, but think that if I could manage it, I could be a real good friend. But I still feel terrible because she's such a nice girl, and she put up with me for so long.

I feel so bad for treating her that way and wish there's some way I can make up for the things I did, but I don't know how. My friends say the best thing is just for me to leave her alone, but I still want to be her friend, I still care about her. And I can't forgive myself for the things I've done.

My marriage has been dying slowly for the past 8 years.  Lack of respect, affection and communication are some of the reasons.  Intimacy has waned each year with me literally crying silently after sex because I felt so alone.  With children at home, I felt that it was better to stay together but I found that I was becoming disgusted with him even touching me.  

I started to exercise, joined a book club, traveled and took art classes.  I listened to music, explored the internet and connected with friends.  But I was still lonely and when I got a message of friendship from an old classmate (and my first love), I thought it would be good to catch up.  He was married and lived 1000 miles away.  The rules were simple-- friendship, honesty and openness.  No requirements but it was not a flirtatious friendship-- curiosity and catching up.  

So I was lonely and apparently so was he.  Simply friends, sharing emails back and forth, getting to know each other.  Sharing work advice, family dynamics of our children, hopes/fears for their choices.  If conversations got too personal-- we changed the subject.  

I found that I looked forward to these emails and they immediately brought a smile to my face and a boost to my day.  We communicated a lot -- practically every day. We shared ourselves.  

I fell hard.  I knew I was falling in love, but it felt very real and natural.  I went into this relationship openly and honestly.  From his standpoint, his marriage was empty- no communication, intimacy.  He said that his wife married him because he was safe.  He was a meal ticket.  
She did not want him or necessairily like him, but tolerated him.    

It became an love affair for both of us.  And while we both knew it was duplicitious, we were accepting of this.  It was a happy time and I had a friend that knew me and understood me.  He was my best friend and lover.

Fast forward to now.  His wife now wants to work on marriage and become more together.  Where two months earlier, he professed his undying love for me and me him, she asks to him to not communicate.  That the problems in their marriage were her fault by not being open and receptive and her lack of attention. That she wants it to be more of a marriage.  

So I understand this.

But it was real for me.  I never, never would have even gone further than a friendship and opened up my heart for such pain.  I have never been so open and trusting and now am heartbroken. 

The past two months have been agonizing and I keep reminding myself that this was a choice-- my choice.  It will get better.  

But he wants to still continue a friendship.  At first, I missed him so much that I agreed but said that since he is the one who is working on saving his marriage, he will decide how much communication is good.  

Now I am realizing how painful it is for me.  I am still missing my dear friend who I still love.  I still read the emails, hear his voice, but also know that he is having a good time with the woman he is married to.  

I know I should cut off all communication with him, but I cannot give up the hope that my heart holds-- thinking he will choose me.  
 
Am I better off ending all contact with him?

23685,Infidelity,1h95k5,"My [50M] wife [49F] was a stay at home mom. We became empty nesters several years ago. Last fall she took a job working for someone who was a friend of ours.

During the time she worked for him, she assured me he was gay. She would go out to his home after hours (with my knowledge) to help him with his computer or similar stuff. I missed her, I wanted her home, but it made her happy and I felt it was innocent, since he was gay.

Turns out he isn't gay - I caught her having sex with him February 7.

Over the next week she continued to contact him secretly while she said she was trying to work out things with me. I finally said I needed to see her Facebook, phone, etc. to see what had really been going on.

Looking at her Facebook, I found out she had a number of single female friends whom she had been messaging about him and about me, and that she had been telling them awful lies about me for the last couple years, mirroring the negative things they were saying about the men in their lives.

She claims she said those things to fit in. To be liked.

She had done similar things a few other times in our marriage. Each time she had gotten together with a group of women who were upset with their partners and said terrible, untrue or extremely exaggerated things about me. Each time she has promised she would not do that to me again.

Looking at her Facebook and text messages, I also found she was coaching the man she was having the affair with to do the things she liked in bed. I guess that makes sense, but it's a hard pill to swallow.

I love her, I am committed to her, but I have to have loyalty, fidelity and partnership. I am 50. This is the only life I have. I can't wait another 10 years to see if she will be true to me.

I don't feel I can talk to family or friends about this because it will permanently taint her in their eyes. No one has any idea what is really going on.

I am coming to reddit mostly to help me think through the process. She is away for the weekend at one of our son's houses, so I have a couple days to think.

Here are questions I have:

Am I being naive to think she will be loyal and faithful now when she hasn't been in the past?

After chatting via FB for few months, we moved to WhatsApp. i.e. she gave me her number when I asked for it. Positive sign? Dunno.

23696,Breakups,2hdrwy,"We've of course, had our fights and issues before, but we were working on them and getting through some more than others. We met off Warcraft ( an MMO for those who don't know) and started watching Avatar the Last Airbender together and really hit it off.

In one night, I managed to break him. He's checked out, doesn't want to get married or move in anymore. Nothing. He had sent a text during an argument one night and I thought it had meant he was breaking up with me, and for some reason, I stuck to that thought. We fought again and it went really south from there on Monday. I should have listened when he apologized, but I kept on about it. We broke up that night over a mere misunderstanding and my refusal to accept it as such.

We got a dog together and he has her and told me he was keeping her and I threatened to file a police report. Mistake number two.

Ever since then he's shut down completely. Feeling like there's a gap between us and closed our bank account. 

He told me today he was looking for a jump at the chance to leave and it's all he's thought about the past two days. I'm genuinely heartbroken, but he says the relationship has put too much stress on him and he thinks it's for the better for himself. Which I can understand. 

I guess I'm just here to vent....

I already miss so much. I'm still even wearing the ring he got me. Him smiling and his ADHD, playing with our dog. The movies we'd watch together, still playing Warcraft, redditing together. I fought so hard to convince him to stay and try and work on things, but he refuses on the grounds that too much has to change and it's not fair and a few other things.

This has already changed me so much. He pointed out so many things I needed to work on, I kind of just stopped. It makes me sick to do them.

23699,Breakups,25d0w2,"My bf and I had been together for 14 months in a long distance relationship. We had been close friends for a couple months before we started dating. At that time, things were pretty simple for us. Neither of us worked, and school really wasn't an issue so we would just hangout and play games and watch movies together. We saw each other for the first time in person a year ago, and physically we were very compatible.

I have a history of being sexually abused by boyfriends, and he was the first who seemed to genuinely care about what I wanted and didn't want and was always very respectful. He helped me out tremendously in dealing with my social anxieties, depression and PTSD. He was my world.

Then, a couple months ago he got a job. I was super happy for him, because he hadn't been working, and the plan was that he would move out to live with me, he just needed the money. We would split living expenses and have each other there to start our lives over, since we both had dropped out college, but were tired of living under our parent's thumbs. With that job came new coworkers who became friends, which was great, but I didn't see the point as he was going to move out here n a couple months anyways. I noticed him texting one girl in particular a lot (we would webcam with each other pretty much every night) and I knew something was going on. He insisted she was just a friend and I trusted him, since he'd never given me any reason not to.

Then, he started changing. He started hanging out with friends more until the early morning, started webcamming me less, responding to texts slower and slower until they rarely came at all. I felt super unimportant to him and left out of his life. Considering that he had proposed in a way to me back in February before he had a job, I was freaking out and started becoming very jealous and clingy towards him, which in hindsight was a bad move. Anyways, over the past couple weeks, he and I have been talking about splitting up, but I originally wanted to save our relationship. I didn't think that a couple of fights should really tear us apart after all that we'd been through in our time together.

We resolved things (I thought) with him being more open and honest with me, and I would try to be less needy. At that point he informed me that he had 'feelings' for the girl I mentioned earlier. I kind of called that one, but said I really wanted to work through this so we could be together, and he agreed. Things were ok for literally a day, and then he ditched our plans to go hang out at his friends' and watch some sports. He'd never really been a sports guy before, but I figured yeah, this will be a good exercise in me letting him live his life and be less needy. So I consented, as long as he would text me goodnight if he stayed out late, then text me when he got home.

I occupied myself the best I could, but when 1am rolled around and I hadn't heard anything, I got worried. I waited up until 4am to hear something from him, but got nothing. Turns out, he had decided to go out drinking with the girl from before, then told me that she and another girl had frequently been staying over nights with him. He assured me that nothing sexual was going on, and they slept in another bed. I asked him to maybe stop having that happen, and he 

said no, he didn't want to. He liked having friends and hanging out. I called him the day after the bar incident, and he was out to lunch with her. This wasn't the first time he'd taken her out on one of these date-like situations, so I was pissed and hurt. He'd spent an entire Friday at the mall with her, gone to sex shops with her, talked about his sexual fetishes with her, and something I'd really wanted to do, put makeup on him. I'd told him that it was something I wanted to do, and he'd always staunchly refused me. In the end, I told him I couldn't take being hurt like this anymore, and if he still wanted to breakup, fine.

He texted me later saying how hurt and embarassed he was, since he was out at lunch with her, and that his gf had dumped him over literally not sending a text and what was I trying to be, his mom? I explained how I felt, and he apologized, but said he wouldn't apologize for hanging out and doing all those things with her because he loved her and she was a good friend. He then said he needed a couple days to gather his thoughts and we'd speak again this weekend.

I was crushed when he told me he loved her. He couldn't even manage to tell me that himself when we were dating. We kind of texted on and off, and I was foolish to expect I'd get an answer from him. As I mentioned before, my mental health isn't the best, and feeling disconnected from the one person in your life you'd come to trust and love drove me insane. I couldn't handle it anymore, and decided to put him in a position where he didn't have to choose anymore. 

To me, his silence was proof enough that he was choosing his friends of two months, over his best friend of 2 years. I then tried to kill myself. I was jumping into the great unknown with a new job in a new city and a place of my own, but all of it didn't seem worth it without the person I wanted to spend my life with.

Long story short, I chickened out and went home instead, only to be taken to the hospital for suicide watch by my parents. After a long, cold night, I was released and woke up to a message from him saying that he had felt so helpless the previous night and that I was being really selfish and stupid. That he had had every intention in getting back together with me at the end of this weekend, but now he wasn't so sure since I had made him feel the worst he's felt in his life, and he's not sure how things could ever work out now. I explained to him again about how disconnected I felt from him and how unloved I felt, and he assured me that he still loved me and thought of me as his best friend.

I'm still grief-stricken, but we've agreed that we're going to try and remain friends, but-- I can't stop thinking about him. He's still the love of my life and I would do anything to get him back, to have him hold me and tell me it's going to be ok, to play games with him and just hang out the way we used to. The thought of him going out with 
the girl hurts, I'm afraid that he's going to replace me with her, since she's conveniently there and I'm stuck here, 400 miles away. I'm afraid of how much that would hurt, and how I could ever get over that if he still wanted to be friends.

Her emotions are flip flop, her temper is a hair trigger and I'm lost as to what to do. Her for the past days , I'd say 3, she has been especially strange. For a while we will be great.

Usually wouldn't bother me, but the movie she was gonna see was the one I planned on taking her to see on valentines day. I told her that, and she got upset and so mad at me, cussing me out, belittling me all because I said I was planning on taking her. I never told her she couldn't go, I just wanted to let her know I had planned a date around it. I was trying to keep it a surprise.

I know we are done and will continue to be but I need closure from him.

This weekend I got off work at 1230 and went back to my place to hang with my bf and our friend. When I got there he was already drunk and on something. I was tired and he was making a bit of an ass of himself. 

My friend left and I told him lets go to bed. We went upstairs and he was out cold. Woke up and sleep walked into my closet trying to use the washroom. He was out of his mind. He lid back down and took over most of the bed leaving me shivering in a corner. My attempts to get him to move were met with 'stfu' and 'fuck off'. One last time i nudged him hard and angerily said 'I didnt sign up to babysit your ass because youre so fucked up.' He woke up, snapped and immediatly went to hit me with his forearm but stopped in front of my face. Went around my room getting his things and breaking stuff. Walked downstairs and I thought he left but he came back and slammed open the door putting a hole in the wall. I snapped. Its my friends house not mine. I was just living in the spare room.

I followed him around downstairs and yelled. Finally he left and I locked the door. He txted 10 mins later saying he left his beer and to put it by the door. I kept saying I wasnt going to open it. He said the door wouldnt stop him and the story ends in him kicking in the door and me calling the cops. He got arrested and let out 8 hours later. Cannot speak to me or be near me.

Now heres the confusing part. He got out and txted me just the simple word 'cunt'. I let it slide and didnt tell the cops. I could see how he would be mad. He was speaking to my friend who left that night and said hes depressed and cant speak or see me so he guesses its over. And he cant believe I called the cops.

Do you see how Im confused? I had been previously abused by my dad and my ex and he knew this and used it as leverage against me to scare me. Thats psychoatic. I still love him and I know he feels the same. Those feelings cant go away. This was the first incident ever like this. Our fights are just normal disputes.

She still sees this guy socially when I can't be there, which I know they go to the same school and he's in the same social groups it's probably unavoidable.  She hangs out with other guys and just today dropped on me that she was going to watch football with two other guys.

Now I don't expect her to sit in and not have a social life when I'm not around but she just doesnt seem to grasp how much I'm still hurting over this. 

So I'm torturing myself daily, creeping on her and all her friends facebook pages and It's driving me crazy.  I just don't know if I can trust her.  If you'd asked me if I did 4 weeks ago I'd say yes without question.  Now if i'm not there and she's out...everything goes through my mind, who's she with, what's she doing.

She said she would be totally honest with me, she tells me where she is etc but she could be making it up. If it happened again I dont know if she'd tell me.

I broke up with her around a month ago because we were constantly arguing and I wasn't happy. 3 weeks after we broke up it appears that she may of had sex with someone else and she implied this in many ways she also signed up to snog.com where people Rate her on Snog, Marry, Avoid and seemed to be getting a lot of attention, aswell as her constant posting of pictures of her where she is looking at her best and all these compliments she is getting. (Which to clarify she never posted images like this before to get compliments from guys even before she met me)

She has now implied she is dating or has found someone else yet I don't know if she has even had sex or dating or if this was all implied to get at me the thing is she does it in such a way which keeps me guessing she gives just enough information so It can bother me an example is Wow he is so gorgeous &lt;3. After she had posted she went out with two of her friends.

The problem is I have got into a horrible habit of checking what she is posting and I'd actually say its got to the point where I'm addicted to checking and if she hasn't posted things I get worried to if she is actually okay (because previously I was worried she was gonna commit suicide and she had threatened it so I used to check her stuff daily to make sure she was alright). I know this all sounds stupid but its true she has managed to make me addicted to checking her posts which make me jealous and I don't know why.

23717,Breakups,22hr66,"Where to begin.... Its been a day that has pushed me to my breaking point several times over...

Best start at the beginning,
Which was probably thee most amazing week of my life. I was 17 at the time, visiting Isla Vista for the very first time (UCSB). I had been locked up in a room with a smokin hot 21 year old petite wild girl. With crazy green emerald eyes, I'll never forget those... It had started as a one night fling, yet quickly escalated to telling each other every single aspect and secret of our lives, with no filter what so ever. A complete honesty of who we were, coupled by continuous and mind-blowing sex. 

I ended up staying there an entire week with her, just us two in the room. Pouring ourselves to each other, after i visited a second time she realized how much I wanted her and that she wanted me. So she asked me to be with her, to my amazement. 

We are both extremely ambitious students, pursuing science, which was one of my biggest attractions to her, aside from her absolutely stunning and sleek outward appearance, it was her ambition and her desire to contribute to something greater than herself that attracted me most to her. She was studying Biological Psychology and Neuroanatomy, and I Physics and Engineering.

We were so happy for most of these 2 years, although we only got to see each other 2 weeks at a time and during summer/winter/spring break, it was unbelievable the way she made me feel. The way she looked at me, in disbelief of how i made her feel, the way i made love to her, the way i held her, it would give her goosebumps as she told me that no one had ever treated her as I did, that I made her feel like she would finally be happy after her past traumatic relationships....

I always did everything I could to support her through whatever she was going through with school and all the stress that comes with living in a college party town. And i knew she liked to go out and have fun, but I always thought she was responsible. But it was all too much for her, the pressure and intensity of the classes paired with living in an ongoing party (Isla vista, CA) made her buckle under the pressure. She failed classes, dropped out of some, and barely skimmed by the rest,She partied and procrastinated, got blacked out at clubs, and started doing coke (again).

Now mind you, this happened gradually and sporadically with gaps of normality so it was not like she was hitting rock bottom, it was all oddly subtle... So i always held to the belief she could pull out of it, and she was still always happy with me, so i just gave as much support as she allowed me to give.

About 3 or 4 months ago the consequences of all her partying and neglect of school caught up to her, she can't complete the degree anymore (its her last semester as a senior) and has to take up a different one. She began saying she is bi-polar and clinically depressed. I desperately tried to help... I did all i could to talk her through it, be there for her....


Then she asked for me to give her time to be alone so that we could break up and come back when it was appropriate... She said she was getting a symbol that was very important to both of us (a design we had come up with) tattooed to prove to me she would always be mine...


She drifted.... Far... Keeping me at arms length, calling me when she wanted.. But never answering my calls. Keeping me hopeful and waiting for when i could have my queen back. My kitty... Thats what i called her. Its been like this for a month... In 2 more months she we were to get back and live together

Well today was another phone call... I couldn't take the empty hope anymore so I just asked her to make up her mind, because i dont see why she was
Keeping me like this.... Turns out she has fallen out of love with me and didnt know how to tell me, thought i was too protective and jealous of her always being out with her guy friends. We talked about marriage, kids, all of it. She had never spoken to me the way she did over this phone call, her voice so cold, dismissive, and uncaring... I thought we had agreed to spend the rest of our lives together, and she was able to forget about it in the blink of an eye.....

23725,Breakups,2kpfge,"2 Weeks ago on the weekend my ex (we were together then) went on a trip (for education) with a group she was put in; who were mostly my friends and hers. After she got back we had a chat about us, this ended up in her telling me she had feelings for one of our friends, Gary, and these had grown rapidly over the weekend.

Our relationship was going stale before this for a few months and we had tried to address the problem but could not solve it. This is what the talk was about. As I still wanted her but did not want to stop her happiness we worked out that we would stay together but not exclusively. This did not work as I became jealous over the week as I saw her getting closer and closer to Gary. We decided to call it off but wanted to stay friends.

Over that week we didn't really stay friends as it was too painful for both of us and things were quite sour.

Nothing ever progressed between her and Gary than a good friendship. The feelings she felt, according to her, had gone and she just blamed it on hormones and she wanted us to be friends again. We were talking for a week as she went to Wales and had nothing to do.

When she came back we went out for the day down the town and to a coffee shop and it was nice. We ended up at my place and one thing led to /another/. This was nice but confusing at the same time.

The next day we talked over and decided on basically being good friends with benefits.

This week we have been back at college and the first days were good and the first days in a while I've felt happy and healthy. towards the end of Tuesday though we had a talk as I was feeling a bit insecure and wanted to know if we were exclusive. This launched the conversation of what we /really/ want. I realised I think I want more and want her back again or just to feel love again (just a real clear answer on what could be possible). She just said she did not know what she wants at the moment. This made me feel like she wanted what we had but with someone else (maybe Gary), but if she didn't find that she just could come back to me. This made me feel like a reserve.

I think there could still be feelings for Gary as she 'stopped feeling them' when she discovered he was not really available as he was attracted to Jill, but now that Jill is no long available she feels she has a chance Gary. This makes me feel even worse.

It's only been 2-3 days since the last update but I already am feeling unhealthy because of it, I don't really know what to think or what to do.

[EDIT]
She has multiple mental health problems, so it is common for her to not be in control or aware of her feelings which could explain stuff like the unknowing or one off fling after the 'date' but I don't think that's it. It could also explain the need for me as security as I have tried to help her (and I think succeeded for the most part) for the last 1-2 years

23727,Breakups,3fu77r,"In February I met a girl, and though she lived in another city we became very close. We would talk every night for hours and she was often in my city because her parents lived there, and we would spend all weekend together in those instances. A job came up which was ideal for her in my city, and she got it. At the same time, I had been contemplating moving to another city for a work opportunity, but felt if I was with her I'd much rather a chance at a happy home life and comfortable job I had than climb the career ladder. 

She moved up and got scared about commitment and stopped talking to me - so I took the job after a few weeks waiting. A week after I moved she got back in touch and things started up again. I would go see her often and we talked every night. We weren't in a relationship but it felt like that, and had me contemplating going back to the other city next year. She was aware of this. 

I was so into her I even sent her a drunk text, which I never, ever do. I'm notorious among my friends for refusing to text when drunk - I even when we're all in town and they're trying to find me. General gist was that I miss her and wish I'd stayed in that city. Her reply was that's really nice to know, imagine the fun we'd be having!

We texted that day and made plans for a call that night. That evening I got a text saying she was too tied up, can we do Sunday? Of course. Didn't happen Sunday. Happened Monday. Then this morning I got a text from her that she met someone on Saturday and is keen to see how it goes. 

It crushed me. I was in a meeting and just lost all focus. Went away and had a cry. I wouldn't tell her, because that's gonna impact on her happiness with this guy. I want her to be happy - obviously in an ideal world that would have been with me - so I don't want to do an emotion dump on her. I'm happy for her finding someone as I want her to be happy. In my reply to that text I said that, and that I wasn't going to send her something which would add to her stress about telling me (given I could tell she's been thinking about it for days. I hate when she's sad and I can't be there to help. But I'm left with all these feelings. Last night I was at home missing her and looking ahead to seeing her in a few weeks.

 Now I'm stuck with all this... For want of a better word, heartache. I really feel alone as this is the person I was always chatting to and vice versa. She is an incredible woman who deserved to be my priority. But now what do I do? I can't reasonably try and fight for her after saying that. I don't want to cut her out of my life because I care about her. But I equally don't want to be feeling like this, with this hole, wishing I could just text her or book flights for this weekend to see her or whatever. 

Is this one of those movie situations where Channing Tatum flies to see the girl and has an incredible speech about how she makes him feel like anything is achievable? Or is this the one episode of Ted Mosby telling about the out-of-town girl on his journey toward the final reveal of the mother? Or is it the one where the character doesn't voice his feelings then gets a new hit in the gut every time he sees a new pic on Facebook? Or is it the one where he sends a heartfelt email which he sweats about for hours and she cries on the end and can't decide what to do, so he's actually a douchebag?

My gf (23/f) broke it off with me just before the month July. The 2 weeks leading up to that she wanted to go on a break. And said she still loved me and would be back.  In those 2 weeks i found out she likes another guy and ended up sleeping with a 3rd guy. Meanwhile she still claimed to love me and she just needed to find herself eventually it became obvious thst she didn't have any intention of getting back together, not that I know of anyways.

I loved her a great deal.  She was beautiful and caring before this all started. I was getting ready to propose to her this summer,  and had agreed to having a kid with her after the summer if we could make things work. I was fully prepared for the commitment and truly wanted to start a family with her. She was the reason for all my effort in the past 3 years. Every change I made was for her.  I gave her a home when she had nowhere to go.  I moved across town when the new neighbors were harassing her.  I did what I could and she still left me for a man who's already cheated on her.  I was faithful,  i was loyal and never hid anything from her. 

Now that it's over I feel myself wanting to go back to her.. we haven't spoke other than some formalities about her belongings and one time she even told me that my feelings don't matter to her.  She was my first true love and even though my friends all say I can do better and that she is just toxic to me. I still feel myself wanting to mend things due to this overpowering loneliness. 

I've been doing all the typical things to help cope.  Excersice, going out with friends, embracing my hobbies. But in the end it doesn't seem to be helping.

Met her 5 times in the past 6/7 weeks, mostly at her house, talking, watching movies and fooling around, we get along great and have had 1 proper date where I took her to a zoo and took a surprise picnic which went down very well.

A few things though over the course of the past few weeks is that she's told me she's still speaking with other guys from dating sites, and that the pics she sends me were being sent out to others too, I figured this, but felt she didn't need to randomnly volunteer that information. On the 2nd date I was having performance problems, this has been a long time problem for me and thought it would be better with her, but I covered it with the fact I was tired as I had been awake for 24hrs, on the 3rd meeting I told her the truth and she's been very supportive!

She did tell me that she'd not met anyone else but me since we first met, and stopped sending anyone else pictures 2 weeks back, and I also found out she cooled it off with 2 other guys after meeting me.

On Saturday she went to a party, prior to going she was telling me she didn't want to go and would rather be hanging out with just me, I was sick and up early for work so couldn't go see her, and she went and ended up taking some drugs - she was upset as her ex had tried contacting her, and, because she does like me and didn't want to lie, revealed things got a bit wild and she ended up kissing around 4 guys there. This didn't bother me, but a couple of days later she sent a message saying fun time's over and that she needs to get back to reality and someone will get hurt - she explained that she also really liked another guy.

23732,Infidelity,31cbwc,"Using a throwaway as my main account is a giveaway of real name.


I met [26F] in October 2014, friends of friends and absolutely fell in love with this girl. She was funny, we talked for days on end and the feeling was mutual. We ended up signing a lease together with 2 of her friends (now mutual) in a place in Bethesda in mid-March.. For the first week things were great and it seemed like things were normal. Then things got bad. We have less sex, she becomes not very talkative towards me and ends up telling me she is bored of our relationship... Out of nowhere.


I failed to mention during this time she started a new job where one night she jokingly mentioned her boss [28M] is attractive but he dips so she wasnt really attracted to him in that way. About 2 weeks into our new apartment I notice she has been texting this [28M] frequently and often being quite weird about it. I asked her what was going on and I honestly went about it the wrong way. I am a bit of a jealous type as I have been cheated on in the past. She is an extremely independant and secretive person so she lost it on me and big fight occured. Fast forward another week of her still texting him frequently we go to a local show together and she got pretty drunk. During the show she kept telling me to go up front and have fun and everytime I looked back I would see her texting someone. So I go back and notice it was 28M, sending him snapchats of the show and talking about going to shows together in the future... (well this sucks). I try not ruin the night and just drop it, when we went to leave she was being generally bitchy and argumentative, I figured it was just the alcohol.


My gut feeling at this time was that I didnt trust her, not sure why but I didnt. She past out and for the first time ever I go through her phone (never did that with any exes) and I find texts from her and him talking about how she snapchatted innappropriate pictures of herself to him. I lose it, called up my roommates and explained what was going on.. Because she was drunk I figured Id go stay at my moms for tonight and deal with it the next day. The plan at the time with the roommates was kick her out and live on.


So I got pretty intoxicated at my local bar and ended up being a bit childish and blasting her on Facebook and posting pictures of the conversation from 28M and 26F. Not the right thing I know (Facebook is now deactivated). Wake up in the morning with a text from roommates saying to call them when I wake up and I should probably delete the facebook posting.


Called them as soon as I woke up and explained it was a mistake. They tell me that they moved in because they are friends with 26F and want me to move out and that I need to call 26F. I called 26F and she explained she was very upset with me and wanted to talk about things with us so I went along with it because in all honesty I love the hell out of this girl. I wanted to work through this. So we come to an agreement that we will live together for the month and work on things.


Since then she still seems very distant and I have taken somewhat of a 'leap of faith' in trusting her because I know the type of person she is. However we still dont have sex, have stupid arguments and generally dont talk like we used to. She still kisses me goodbye in the morning, calls me Love and tells me that she loves me.


Reddit, I know this post probably is dumb and I know the answer is gonna be to drop her but I really have never been happier in my life than when I was with this girl. I have never been one to hang around and I felt like we were so good together. I just want to know if anyone here has been through a small thing as emotionally cheated on and gotten past it and back to normal.


Should I give her the trust? I figure thats the only way of truely finding out what will happen without pushing her away again. Do I just get up and move out?


Im really bad at this and am a bit scared to be honest, thats why I feel like Ive become such a weak person... I just really dont want to lose this girl. Ive been in a 4 year relationship before this and I never felt like I did about 26F...


Just need some advice. Sorry if parts dont make sense, still pretty upset and bummed out with everything. First time Ive written everything down and I feel like I condensed things a bit.

I was going to sign onto Skype on his laptop since mine was broken and he is out of state for two days to have a pleasant video chat with him... Nope. I pull up Skype, and- **BAM!** I see all of these females with sexual names added onto an account I didn't even know he had. 

First blow. 

Being in denial, and not wanting to assume, I browse around by clicking on one of their names. Okay- evidently they had e-mailed my fiance. Maybe this is an invasion of privacy, and maybe I'm overly paranoid, but my gut tells me to check his e-mail account. Okay, so here I am- nothing. Great! Maybe this Skype was just an old account- that's what I'm trying to convince myself of, anyway. Why would the man who claims to care for me as deeply as mine do this to me? Nope, not the case. 

I check his deleted folder- and *oh, hey.* Look at that, PoF e-mails as well as some other dating sites.. right.. there. In my face. Some of them ha been created a few months ago (the start of January 2015), and some had been made within the past month. I'm sick and in a rage by this point, so I try logging into his PoF account and guess the password so I could show him better evidence when I confront him- too easy. I log in within the third attempt, and.. I freeze. Guys, I don't know what to do.

 It's one thing seeing e-mails and random girls on a Skype account, but to see his picture that I took on one of our recent dates together as his profile picture.. it hurts. What do I do at this point? I love him with all of my heart, and I want it to work.. I just.. I don't have words. I can't stop sobbing and I don't think I'm going to have the courage to bring it up for a while until I feel like everything's sorted out. 



He's done something similar to this before: Back in January, I found an app on his phone that was an anonymous type of Omeggle (sp?) chat, and he had keywords for kink we did together and listed a kik- things like that. I confronted him as soon as I found it, but he claimed it was an old app and had somehow managed to re-download itself. He tried turning it around on me and bring up a time when we had first gotten together when I was drunk off my ass and answered a Skype call with some guy's junk in the cam. I don't think it registered because of how far gone I was, but that was his defense. Something like that. He threatened to end things if I didn't stop accusing him of things he didn't do, so I dropped it and shoved it under the rug.

How do I bring this up? What can I say? I'm at a loss.

She was really talkative, she even complimented me. I wrote to her on FB, but her responses are damn short and emotionless. What shall I do?



Once I was at a party. I met there Sandra basically for first time (we didn't know eachother pretty much). We got drunk etc, and she may have gotten feeling that I wanna make her blackout just to do whatever-i-want with her. Don't want to get into the details since I don't think it matters that much. Anyways, I didn't plan it to be that way, so after this party I apologized her, she accepted the apologies.



Month and half later from this party (3 days ago) we accidentaly met at next party. At the very first moment she acted kind of strange, like she didn't want to meet me in first place, but shortly afterwards this passed. So we talked a lot. Like really a lot. At 2;00AM we even went on a walk - somebody needed to bypass our friend, I offered that I would do this, and asked for someone to help me, because this guy was blacking out. She did approach on me and offered that we would both go. It was like 20 minutes of pure conversation. She even has called me really intelligent, and she apologized for how she treated me after the first party. I didn't want to fuck up and kiss her or just move on. Why? She really hates men that she've firstkissed at the party.



Okay, so here I am now, with confused feelings. I would really like to date her. When I started writing to her, she was like absent.  One sentence short answers without any emotions. That's really strange considering she is rather talkative. Today I did met our mutual friend and along the lines she mentioned me texting Sandra. But it was like for a second.

23748,Dating,23sfij,"Hi everyone,

Some of this may sound pompous/shallow.  Sorry in advance if it does, that's not my intention just trying to give the appropriate context.

Her - Attractive former model (not sure what extent), eastern european (moved to US at 21).  Currently works in fashion.  Intelligent, witty when it comes to conversation.  Very confident.  Jet setter kind of girl but doesn't have the money to really live that lifestyle.  edit - SHE IS NOT SHY

Me - Standard successful good looking guy (Juan Martin Del Potro with shorter hair) with a big house, exotic car, nice clothes, in shape, etc.  I'm a kind person and treat everyone with respect no matter what their position in life (edit - but I'm mean on the internet, see comments for details).  I'm typically good with women, good conversationalist and know how to make people laugh.

On paper, we are the kind of people who match in that one isn't settling for the other kind of thing.

I've gone on a few dates with this girl and we text and talk on the phone daily.  

Verbally in person, text, and on the phone, she shows a lot of affection and if you looked at that aspect alone, she seems very into me.  She has used words like sexy and attractive as compliments to me in conversation.

Her body language is the exact opposite.  I'm used to women who are into me, being receptive to physical contact.  For example, if we sit together on a bench, they will lean into me and putting your arm around them is natural.  I'm talking the basic stuff here.  Most women I date are immediately receptive to physical contact and will initiate it early in the relationship.

I'm not forcing the issue at all, I know the laws of kinesthetics and I have a good gauge of what a woman's comfort level is by her body language.  

This girl is not physically affectionate.  A few examples:

Second date - We're in the darker area of a club near a wall waiting for someone.  We're talking shoulder to shoulder (important) and laughing.  I put my arm around her hip to pull her close and whisper something to her, but she resists.  I roll with it so it's not too awkward but mentally it's a sign that she's not into it.  She'll initiate contact with me here and there by bumping my shoulder kind of thing, but that's about it.

Here for the people who seem to think I'm trying to rape her:

THIS ^

Hour or so later when we're leaving, I walk her to her car and we talk for a little bit about when we're going to go out again.  I have 0 intentions of going for a kiss because of previously mentioned body language signs.  So I give her a hug which she reciprocates and I turn around to walk away.  As I'm walking away she calls out good night and calls me by her petname for me (diminutive form of my name in her native language).  I say goodnight and do the cool point finger in the air hand gesture without looking back at her cuz that's how I roll.

2 minutes later she immediately calls me on the phone, and says she had such a good time and blah blah and has some flirty/funny things to say and that I should call her tomorrow etc.

So, reddit plz.  WTF?

I can of think of 3 scenarios

1)  Her cultural background is different than what I'm used to.  Anyone have any experience like this?

2)  She's interested in me because of my money and is not emotionally attracted to me.  If that's the case, that's fine.  Not ideal but what can you do.

3)  I'm reading the situation wrong.  Possible but I don't think this is likely and if so this thread is pointless.

If all else fails I'm just going to flat out ask her what the deal is this weekend when I see her.  If anyone has any insight here I'd be grateful.

Thanks

23749,Breakups,2r1km3,"We were together for 3 years and it was tough all the way through. We had many problems which mostly stemmed from poor communication and in the end being a bad match.  
  
We were living together and broke up early last year. I moved out and to a different part of town. We tried to reconcile a month and a half ago after 6months of being apart. It ended up in the same bullshit manipulative behavior so we broke up again and I have refused to speak to her since.  
  
She has emailed me every single day since we broke up - everyday, the entire year. I blocked her number, I don't respond, and I don't answer the door when she shows up.  

It has gotten worse at this point and I don't really know what to do. She is now using online services to impersonate me to other people to try and humiliate me. She's been divulging all the personal details of my life and upbringing to try and cause me embarrasment.  
  
She stalks me online and harasses anyone I interact with. I have thought of a restraining order, and that's fine to keep her physically away from my doorstep, but a restraining order doesn't include online activity so I can't do anything to keep her from doing this.  She's also gone on to harass my ex-wife and her family.
  
What can I do to get this person to leave me alone? I've considered retaliating in such a way that would send her a strong message to leave me alone but I fear it will just make it worse.

23752,Breakups,1o3xp5,"About 10 days ago I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nbitb/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_6_months/) about my breakup with my girlfriend. I was really concerned about how it ended similar to a previous relationship. Essentially, I start worrying about how long the relationship will last or I start focusing on some aspect of my partner that is not ideal and I begin to feel a little suffocated at times during our interaction together. Then, she would come to me either feeling like I don't care or I am neglecting her. In the face of this conversation I shutdown and I become very scared about what to say or what to do. I was scared of us working through this and the relationship lasting even a couple months longer. I was also scared that to talk about my feelings and telling her what I wanted out of the relationship. And when breaking up is mentioned in the conversation, I lock on to that and decide to end the relationship. I feel like I ended the relationship out of many personal and deep rooted fears. 

The few days after the breakup I read a lot of things on the internet about dealing with breakups. One thing I did discover was this fear of commitment and avoidant attachment relationship style. A lot of the things I read resonated with me as things that I do. It was like looking into a book about my life. Here is an excerpt about avoidant attachment:

Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with relationship partners, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the defensive character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive–avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with rejection by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (i.e., their relationship partners).

I have also read that these behaviors of men who get involved in a relationship and then leave on a dime is emotionally abusive to their partners/ex-partners. Here is what I have been thinking about. I want to know if I should break the no contact rule and contact my ex and explain to her these issues. I feel guilty that I left the relationship out of fear even though we were both having a good time. I don't think it is fair that I do something to emotionally scar my ex but I am also not interested in getting back together with her.

23754,Dating,276iao,"So I just got back from college a few weeks ago and went to a party for my friend's birthday last week. There I saw this girl that used to have a gigantic crush on me about 3 years ago. We used to talk a lot but I led her on in high school because I thought she was too young for me.

We chatted and exchanged numbers and now I can't stop thinking about her and have to force myself not to text her excessively because I know that it will hinder my chances.

I have no clue where this sudden infatuation came from because I never thought twice about dating her. I think it's because she's grown up a bit and age now is a little less important. She's also a little on the wild side.

She texts me random things like drunnk hi she also calls me pet names and teases me a lot about random stuff. I will admit that I always thought she was beautiful but it just seemed taboo to date someone who is friends with my brother [also 17].

23763,Infidelity,2r3xh1,"My boyfriend (Dan) and I have been together for 2 years. We've known each other for 4. We have an amazing relationship, I could not ask for better. He's the guy I want to marry, always has been.

I fucked up. Bad. This fall semester, I met a guy (Tom) in one of my classes' group projects. He was just.. weird, but not in a bad way. He caught my attention. We started texting, first strictly school related. Then strictly as friends. And well, it never went past the friendly stage, honestly. We never flirted. We never sent anything inappropriate, no pics, no excessive smileys, no compliments, nothing super personal. But we texted enough. And though we never ever crossed the friendly boundary, I started developing a crush on him, which is what made it wrong. I'm very much aware that as soon as I realized my crush, I should have cut contact. I fucked up. I don't know why I continued. We very briefly talked about meeting up for drinks one day but it never happened and I would not have gone. We never saw each other outside of school.

During this time, my bf and I were doing well, but I was confused. I wasn't sure it was what I wanted anymore. But I loved him so much and I didn't want to lose him, I just wasn't sure I wanted to be in this serious of a relationship. We were both super busy and hardly saw each other. About 2 nights per week. Honestly I got so wrapped up in other things in my life that sometimes I forgot about him. I felt like he was separate from the rest of my life? Sort of? I don't know if I'm making sense right now. I just, I've always been someone that needed to see the other often. We've had many fights about this before. I'm not super clingy or anything, I promise. But 2 evenings per week to me is pretty low. I need more in-person time to feel like the relationship is growing, I'd never be able to do a LDR. Dan, on the other hand, during school he basically goes MIA on weekdays. Anyways. This is not an excuse, I'm just trying to set the mood of our relationship.

Then in december, it's the beginning of winter break. I'm seeing Dan more often, I feel like that spark is coming back between us. Tom and I stopped texting. I've spoken to him once since the end of exams, to ask how he did in the class. We exchanged like 2 texts. I think we both lost interest. Everything is dandy.

On NYE, Dan had a little get-together at his house. I got super, super drunk. I don't even remember the countdown. A little past 12am, I sent tons of Happy New Year &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 texts (except more like hayfppy neyeyarrru\3&lt;3) to my friends. For some stupid, idiotic reason I decided to include Tom in those. 

Long story short, I ended up puking everywhere then Dan put me to bed. While I was sleeping my phone kept vibrating, so he checked it. He read all my messages with Tom, which he didn't know existed. He also read all my messages with my BFF, and apparently went up really far until like beginning of November, where I texted her that I had a crush on a guy in my class.

He's understandably really pissed. We talked about it, I tried to handle it as honestly as possible. I didn't make any excuses. I took all the blame. I told him how sorry I was, how much I loved him, how much I fucked up. I told him I'd never speak to Tom again and that he meant nothing to me. I did all I could. He's heartbroken. He seemed so sad, I feel like a total complete piece of shit. That morning we left on what seemed like a sort of hopeful (given the circumstances) note. But then later in the day he texted me saying he wasnt sure he wanted to be in a relationship anymore.

I know I fucked up majorly. I feel terrible. Dan deserves so much better, he's a great man. Is there any chance this is salvageable? What can I do to make this better? What should I do right now, text him from time to time to ask if he wants to talk/tell him I'm sorry &amp; love him, or give him space and wait til he reaches out? If ever he decides to stay together, what can I do to regain his trust? How can I feel more connected to him during the semester?

I'm at a loss. I know I'll probably get totally chewed out on here, I know yall hate cheaters. That's fine, I can take the insults, I know you'd be right. I'm just looking for any advice, I don't care if you call me whatever between that advice.

But things got better and I found good job and there I met this guy he loved my maturity and boldness and said he loves me. I took some time like 3 weeks to respond that I also feel for you and I really started feeling for him. I lied to him about my past; I said I got sexually exploited by people during my bad times, which was not a total lie by the way. He had another girl in his life before me and he said she is nothing and she lives in another city and I don't care for her, she is so immature and I'll soon leave her as she is from other religion so she can't even marry me and she just want to be with me till she get married.

I believed him and said its al-right I can wait and he said they'll breakup very soon, I was not much jealous at start but as I started falling more and more deep in love with him and as we were living together and our office was also same so he couldn't hide things from me and I started feeling jealous.

I started stalking him on his phone and internet and seeing her messages I became more and more restless. One day he said you have to move for a week because she is coming to stay with me for a week. It was too much of pain imagining her with him on same bed where we used to sleep every night but I bore it and luckily she couldn't come but that pain never left me that he can ask me to leave any time because of her.

I hacked his Facebook and forwarded all our chats to her. She called him and asked him what is this? He yelled at me that why I told her and he didn't talk to me for many days and I cried like hell and begged for his pardon so we got normal after many days then she came for an event of 3 days organized by our office and he stayed with her in hotel room and spent whole event with her and had all meals with her in front of my eyes. I fainted because I was not eating for all those 3 days and he didn’t even come to hospital to see me. When she went back we had great fight and he slapped me.

We again kind of broke up but again I begged him and he came back but then it all became common. My telling her that m still with him, his beating and breaking up with me and my begging and his forgiving me. During that time he got to know about my past and he started taunting me about it.

I told him I didn't want to lose him that's y I never told him truth but he said I don’t need love without truth. after this festival thing I slept with 4 more guys till now just to satisfy myself that m also cheating him because he was not only having her all this time  but some other girls as well with whom he often have sex.  But nothing made me happy. And all this time we were living together and loving each other except when he made me cry because of other girls.

Last week he had to go out of city for a week but when we slept I felt something is fishy so I checked his phone after a long time and there were texts that he was going to meet her and after spending a day in her city he'll leave for his real destination. I woke him up and asked him and he said yes m going because she is dying to see me.

I cried and begged but he left me crying and went to meet her. I have not contacted her for 5 months now because I couldn't lose him and I knew if I tell her again he'll leave me for sure but she had some idea I think. that day I slept whole day to calm my anger  but when I woke up in evening I called him and kept calling till he switched his phone off then I started calling the girl and she picked and I said if you have got free of fucking then let me talk to him and she hung on me.

I called him at night and told him that I'm leaving him and he is free now. He didn't contact me from other city and when he came back 3 days ago he was so sue that I’ll be again under his feet but he was surprised that I was not even sad. I had cried in his absence and had composed myself till he came and when he see I'm firm on my decision he became restless. I left his place as well. This evening he was so upset and asked me y I did that and I said you made your choice and I made my decision.
When he went from office he started sending sms to me that y r you doing this and how can you be so cool and calm. and he said you r so clever and cunning and you play with people and use them so now you have used me so you r leaving me you must have met someone else and lot more shit about my being all bad.
Now I don't know what should I do? Should I forgive him because he is in so much pain and I also want to prove that I'm not leaving him because I have someone else?

I've been going under a lot of emotional stress right now. My parents have kicked me out of the house and I'm feeling lost and depressed right now. I've been feeling like the drinking has been getting away from me as well as a ridiculous amount of pot use that I want to stop. For a while I've had a nagging feeling in the back of my head that I need to break up with her but I'm not to myself when I say I love her. She's by far the greatest girl I've ever had the pleasure of sharing a little piece of my life with. There are problems like any couple but it's more about things like her smoking cigarettes, partying too much together stuff life that.

I am hoping that a weekend without much contact will allow me to come back and appreciate her more because I've started to become a progressively shittier boyfriend as time as time goes one, while she continues to be more and more wonderful everyday. Some of it is work stress related (Line Cook at a fine dining restaurant) and the other part is largely due to tension at home. My goal is to come back and realize what I took for granted.

tl;dr What I am asking is, do any of you have a good experience taking a breaking with your SO and what did you do in the time away from him/her?

EDIT1: I should add that after a long day of work in the kitchen, I'd like to be able to control my emotions a little better. Any tips regarding would be helpful

EDIT2: Also adding, we agreed upon this break and I know for a fact she isn't going anywhere. We both consider eachother boyfriend and girlfriend, facebook status' staying the same, so on and so forth

We have an amazing connection with each other and our relationship was fantastic. After a little over a year she calls off our relationship due to each others lives going different directions then starts spending time with at the time a guy who was at the time a good friend. He has a history of liking the women I date and it has been blatantly obvious he liked her for several weeks if not months. I don't know what to make of it. 

---

We split up with the knowledge that she could not handle being in a relationship for multiple various reasons. (I do not doubt these reason nor do I think she lied, without getting too deep into it they are valid and very understandable) To complicate matters more she contacts me a few weeks after not talking and asks to meet up. We end up spending the entire day and night together and it was overall great. The next time I actually hear from her she says she can't do it anymore and has to call our romantic relationship off completely. I am at this point totally confused, bewildered and steadily becoming fed up. Our talk ends with us agreeing that we love each other and hope for another meeting later in time.

---

Four days later I discover said mutual friend has been meeting up with her. After a few days of trying to get any kind of information out of him (he effectively lies without actually saying a lie, i.e. not telling a lie but omitting truths) I turn to her and she admits that they are spending a lot of time together and becoming close. I ask if that has romantic implications and she answers I don't know and If you ask him you'll get a different answer. We didn't really come to any closing point but I was leaving the state in a few days and she wanted to see me off. 

---

The day I left was incredibly emotional. We ended up spending the whole day together. From almost the moment she stepped inside my house she began to cry. We held each other for what felt like forever just sobbing into each other. She kept stammering how sorry she was and how she wished it were different. Once the crying stopped we started telling how much we loved each other. I know this is out of place but for context we were physical i.e. kissing/hugging/holding each other. 

---

We promised that we would see one another in one year, or at least enough time for us to get our lives in line. We pseudo made plans for her birthday. She told me that she would leave first contact to me. We said a lot. We promised a lot. She told me she wasn't ready to be in a relationship. With anyone. I told her that despite how cheesy, how cliche and sappy it was, I wanted her and I wanted to have another chance. Even though our lives were taking us in different directions, we would one day be able to meet again. While we sat there crying all she could manage to say was I love you over and over. At the very end we held each other and said This isn't goodbye, but until next time. That was the last I talked to her. It's almost a month later and I know she's spending time with the friend. 

---


I'm not holding out for her or hoping that she'll magically change her mind and join me (I moved almost 1000 miles away), but I do feel incredibly deeply for her. I still love her. We didn't discuss not being in other relationships with people we meet, but I don't know how to contain this. This is the second time I've had a friend effectively move in on the girl I have feelings for and pull it off. I have completely cut him off from my life but it infuriates me that he hasn't bothered to try and talk to me. (I doubt I'd really listen but it's the effort that counts) Also, both him and her were there for the first friend that took my girlfriend from me and they both understand how I have taken this.

---

I don't know if they're dating. I don't know if they're physical. I don't know anything other than they are spending time together, and it drives me insane. I cannot stop thinking about it. The thing that hurts the most is that we didn't end on bad terms, in fact we ended on the best terms I can imagine. She told me that she would break contact with everyone when she leaves the town we're from. I don't know if that includes him. She asked me to not delete her from Facebook which I know is her way of keeping tabs on me. He and her went to some sort of garden and he tagged her in the pictures on Facebook. It pretty much set me off into simultaneous depression and fury. 

---

So to the point of the matter, I am at a complete loss. I have been incredibly patient and understanding with this girl. I have given her more than I think most people would and feel as though I've been given apathy in return. To be fair, this girl is one who hides or suppresses her feelings and I know that. I know that her way of burying her sadness is diving into something that doesn't make her sad. I get that, and I don't hold it against her. It's how she's doing it that is eating at me. And, again, I don't know what to do. I've moved fucking across country and I still think, dream and talk about this girl.

Does *anyone* have any advice or can relate? I'm desperate to just talk about this but everyone I know lives states away and have their concerns and problems. To put it bluntly I feel a huge weight in my heart that I can't seem to make any lighter.

My ex and I have been dating almost our entire high school career. Throughout the relationship, we have been mostly compatible, but she had a bit of a temper. Every now and then, she would have fits that lasted about a month each where I would have to be very careful about the things I say or I'd get roasted, and not in the funny friendly way. I figured this was a response she built from her verbally abusive ex she was with before me, and let it pass. We had very few fights, but almost every fight we had ended up with me getting bored of being made fun of and apologize. I don't want to play her out to be evil, but I will admit that sometimes things would get really excessive and I would bring it up with her a day or two later. I usually got excuses like I said those things in the heat of the moment and I'll try to watch the things I say from now on. There are a few specific examples that I could bring up if requested, but it's not relevant to our break up reason.


About a year into our relationship, she started to mention that we don't go on dates as much as she would like. I would reply that I would try to get us out more. It wasn't easy, as she had a lot of after-school activities to attend to and I had a part-time job with full-time school. We really only got to see each other once a week on the weekends, so I tried my best. However, it still wasn't enough for her, and she kept repeating that she thinks we don't go on enough dates throughout the rest of the relationship. I kept telling her that I'm trying my best to get us out more, but it isn't easy with our current state. She gave me replies like Ok. and I know. which meant that she was disappointed.


One day, I looked on Snapchat and saw that she took selfies at a movie theater with another man and captioned it At the theaters with the goof :P I immediately went to text her, and I was hoping it would be nothing and just a misunderstanding on my part. So I texted her with What did you do tonight? and she said Hung out with [somekid]. I told her I saw, and she said it was fun. I texted her a few more questions and got out of her that they went to dinner, then the movies. Sounds like a date to me. I said Sounds like a nice movie date and she said it was fun. 


What? it was fun? I then told her that the Sounds like a nice movie date was meant to be a joke, because when I ever go out anywhere and there's ever a girl involved, I would make sure my ex was ok with me going out and it would never, ever be alone with another girl. She would still joke about me going on a date and I would basically do my best to deny it was a date. Apparently, it's different when I do it. She said Well that's more than you and I do. 


Now I got angry. Apparently, I was not good enough, and she had to find dates somewhere else. I told her We go on dates and she said Like every 6 months. At the time, it was only about two weeks since our last date. Now she is finding dates elsewhere, and is unappreciative of how much I've been trying to get us out. As text messages progressed, I eventually told her I wanted to go to bed because it was one of my escapes from arguing with her, and I already felt insulted enough. I would figure it would be like everything else, I'd wake up in the morning, text her good morning, tell her that I was offended the night before, and she would make some apology or try to justify her actions, and I'll say sorry just because that's what she wanted to hear. She caught on when I said I wanted to go to bed and said Really? I upset you with that joke? I asked what joke she was talking about, because she seemed dead serious about everything. She said the Well that's more than you and I do was suppose to be a joke.


Bullshit. That was 100% serious and I think she figured out that she's in trouble. This is where I told my friends and family what happened, and I immediately found something I wasn't expecting. People actually *asked* me to leave her. A lot of friends said that I was too good for her, and she didn't treat me right. Family said I should leave her because going on a date with another man is unacceptable. I was really surprised by the responses, it's like everyone was holding it all back until shit hit the fan, and they found an opening to speak their mind about our relationship. I saw this as a sign that maybe this isn't going to work out.


My ex and I argued for the rest of the night, she mostly just kept denying that what she did with another man was a date, and just kept digging herself deeper and deeper. Eventually, she posted on a Facebook that all men were stupid (I don't have a Facebook. Maybe she thought I don't have friends that can see it?). This is the part that I'm truly grateful for, my friends and even my mom came to my defense on the post, saying that it was wrong of my girlfriend to go on a date with another man. I also learned that they videochatted for hours a month or two before the date. 


She talked back to all of them with attitude on Facebook, including my own mother. Not only has she insulted me now, but my friends and my mom. She'd fare well on XBox Live, but not in this relationship. I was more disappointed and hurt than I was angry, and this is the part where I'm not sure how well I did. I thought I did everything else pretty well, I told her exactly how I felt about the situation and she basically insulted me and said that I should trust her more and that I know her better than that. The next day she kept it going and I couldn't take it anymore, I just left her. I called her up and dumped her, I was so sick of it that I just dropped her.


Did I overreact? This was about a week ago, and she still angrily texts me, and whenever an insult gets thrown I just stop responding, because I feel that I shouldn't have to deal with that, and I am now above that. Is that self-absorbed? I understand that I'm young, but that's really why I'm asking. I want to learn and grow from this, and I want an opinion from outside, because all my friends and family are ready to curse her out. My questions are: 
Was that the right things to do?
Did I overreact?
Should I have given her another chance, even if the trust has broken?

Also need to point out I have always had a thing for red heads particularly dark red, I don't know why I just find them extremely attractive. My girlfriend is not a red head.

So at work (Customer service at a community center) we have been short handed for some time now and we finally hired 2 new staff members, myself and 1 of my co-workers were asked to train one of the new hires last night since were among the most experienced so we both said sure. So last night the new hire Olivia [20 F] walked in and it was the first time I was meeting her. I was stunned when I saw her she is gorgeous with the killer being she has beautiful long dark red hair. Myself and my co-worker introduced ourselves to her and we each took turns training Olivia and teaching her different things depending on the customers we received. Everything single time that I would call her over to show her something I noticed my heart rate would increase and I would want be closer to her and could just feel the physical attraction towards her and I don't mean I was aroused I mean I was attracted to her and the reason I say its physical is because know virtually nothing about her so it can't be anything else. 

After work and even today I can't stop thinking about her its driving me crazy I find myself constantly trying to push her out my mind and distract myself to stop thinking of her. I feel awful I really do love and care for my girlfriend even in this rough patch and would never do anything to hurt her. I could never cheat on her I have been cheated on before I know how much it hurts and she has been cheat on before too and could never put her through that. To add to it as well Olivia has a boyfriend (came up during small talk between the 3 of use) and I would feel like a complete ass to break up another relationship.

I could really use some advice I already know I am going to be working shifts with Olivia and I know that attraction is always going to be there. I just feel terrible about everything and hate myself for it. Am I an asshole for feeling this way towards Olivia but still loving and caring for my girlfriend. Like I always considered myself a pretty stand up guy and would never do anything like this but I feel I might do something.

I just need a way to get Olivia out of my head so that I don't mess up and do something I know I shouldn't.


tl;dr I'm in a committed relationship but find myself extremely attracted to a new co-worker who is also in a comiited relationship and need advice so that I don't mess up and do something stupid

EDIT: Removed a portion everyone was over focusing on, I know I need to have self control I don't need to be told to grow up. I have been attracted to co-workers before my departments staff is almost all women (currently I am the only male staff) and I've controlled myself just fine for the past 6 years of constantly working with attractive women my age. For whatever reason my attraction to Olivia is a lot stronger what I am looking for is some advice on how to keep my mind off her.

23803,Dating,2t0mfs,"Hello everyone!

I'm really having a hard time figuring this out and I hope this is not a silly dilemma. I got out of a long lasting relationship that hurt me a lot and ever since then I decided I would be better alone for a while and didn't want to get seriously involved with anyone. Until I met this guy in particular.

I've been in a casual relationship with him for 3 months. He told me from the beginning he didn't want a serious relationship. At first, I truly thought he was simply using me for sex. But the truth is.. he is constantly talking with me when we're appart, via text message or facebook messenger. Even when he goes out with his friends!!
When we're together he is super cute. Takes me out to dinner, cuddles with me, makes jokes... I mean all the things you kind of want the boyfriend to do.

The only things we don't do as boyfriend and girlfriend are: 

- holding hands (which he did when he was drunk by the way, but only then) 

- going shopping for clothes (he just told me he didn't want me to go with him to buy clothes - something he did with his ex girlfriends)

- meeting each other's families (which doesn't really bother me at all, since I don't really want to introduce mine or be introduced to his)

I already know his friends from before we started going out. They like me and I like them. I'm not exactly invited to their plans, but many times we're at the same events, because of common friends. When it happens there's no problem if I stick around his friends and he actually tells me to stay with them.

So what's the difference and why doesn't he commit to me? He tells me he is not in a point in his life where he feels like he can commit so seriously. He also tells me that if I ever felt bad in this situation we'd have to break up everything.

Truth is... in the beginning I didn't really care about any of this. I wanted my freedom too. But now I'm falling deeper for him. I am very afraid my feelings will get hurt again and that I'm clinging to stupid hopes that, with time, things are going to change.

What should I do? Should I bail while I still can? Or should I wait around to see how this can evolve? I believe I'm already in too deep. I know it's not such a long time, but if I didn't like him, I'd be bored with him already. We get along really well and I enjoy being with him and chatting with him when we're not together...

Thank you so much.

Please try to read all of it if you can, **I really need insight as well as guidence.** I’m the type of person who analyses everything, and this has been torturing me because I don’t understand it. **I’m posting this to see if anyone can help me gain a better understanding of her thought process. Additionally, I want to get back together with her**, and I know this is reddit and everyone probably thinks *She cheated on me so we should break up* (sarcasm) but I really want to be with her.


I don’t really know where to begin. My girlfriend, Taylor, and I met though a mutual friend who put us together in January. We both go to the same college, but she will be a senior this year and I will be a Junior. We went on a few dates in the beginning of last semester (the beginning of February) and at first I really wasn’t that drawn to her. She was cute and very smart, but she just seemed too shy for me. So I stopped talking to her for about two weeks. At this time I was also infatuated with this crazy party animal of a girl in one of my classes. **One morning I woke up and realized I was chasing the wrong girl. I had been waiting literally years (Since highschool) for a girl like Taylor, someone respectable and honest, to walk into my life and I was just walking right by it. I decided to give her a second chance.** I invited her to come hang out with my friends one Friday night and god did we hit it off. I realized our one-on-one dates at coffee shops and getting lunch together at the dinning halls were too intimidating for her, and when we were in a group of people she was much more open and relaxed. That night we ended up going back to my place, which I didn’t want to do because in the past I’ve had an issue with hooking up with girls too soon and then not really respecting them. I told her this a few days later and she was really surprised that I was willing to tell her that and be upfront with her about it. It ended up not being an issue anyways. But I digress.


After a few weeks of sleepovers, hanging out and watching movies, going out together on the weekends, celebrating her 21st birthday and going on a few dinner/movie dates by ourselves and with friends, we became official. This was at the end of April. For the rest of the school year I was happy as I feel I’ve been in a long time. I know people often say that you have to be complete on your own and complemented by someone else, but it really felt as though all the pieces were in place; good grades, awesome friends, and a loving, beautiful girlfriend. She told me she was so happy that I had come into her life, she was tired of guys who didn’t appreciate her. Her last (and first) boyfriend (whom she was never official with) treated her like shit, and she was happy with me. The last few weeks of the semester were awesome, we texted regularly everyday, saw each other almost everyday, and hung out a lot on the weekends. **She would initiate hanging out just as much as I, so I felt the feelings were reciprocated.** 


The semester ended and summer began. Luckily, Taylor lives just a short drive away from me at home, so we would be able to see each other over the summer. However, she pays her way though school and is financially independent of her mother, so she works a lot during summer break. I work a 9-5 during the summer and take night classes twice a week to make up for a year of being undeclared at school, so seeing each other was limited to once a week, sometimes twice. I thought it would be healthy for our relationship; not being able to see each other all the time would make us miss each other and cherish the time we got together more, and for a time it did. We would go on dates and hang out, text each other when we weren’t working. She would get upset when I would have to leave late at night to go home because I had work the next morning. Several times she begged me to stay the night because she missed sleeping next to me. **All summer long it was like this, she was super enthusiastic to hang out whenever I saw her and would get bummed if plans had to change suddenly, as would I.**


**August is where things started to fall apart.** Taylor is 21 and can go to the bars, I can not. She’s a sweet girl and would never cheat, and I’m not the type to freak out and need to know where she is at all times, but something did happen. She told me she has never blacked out before, but a few weekends ago she did, and apparently she made out with one of her female co-workers at the bar. I wasn’t super upset by it, but I told her I didn’t like it, because she had kissed someone else. This didn’t sit well with her. She told me she thought I was being stupid and it wasn’t a big deal because it was her friend. There really wasn’t much compromise on the issue, and I feel like she was embarrassed about it anyways, so I let it be. the next morning I simply texted her saying it bothered me, and I asked her in the future to try not to do it again. For the rest of the week her responses were slow and cold. I could tell sometime was wrong. All summer she had been excited for me to help her move into her apartment, because we could stay the night up there together, and when I asked her about it she said she didn’t want to go anymore. I decided to surprise her after work with a flower and her favorite candy, to bury the hatchet and move on, to try and fix the damage. I wasn’t going to let a little drunken slip up get between me and this girl that I was crazy about, it was something that we could put in the past.


I waited by her car near her work until her shift got out. When she saw me she was totally off guard. She didn’t say much at first. I told her I came to make amends for possibly making her feel judged about the incident the previous weekend, and then I just wanted to put it in the past. She did’t say anything. I asked her if everything was alright and she just kept saying “I don’t know, I don’t know… I don’t know” almost like a whisper under her breath. I told her she could tell me anything, but if she didn’t tell me what was on her mind I couldn’t help her, as I can’t read her mind. **She looked up at the sky and started to cry.** She said she had been feeling weird about us this summer, she said “you do all these nice things for me, like this, and I just don’t know what to do.” I asked her if she wanted to break up and she looked at me, as if to acknowledge I had said it, but she didn’t say anything. after a minute of silence she said she Didn’t want to break up, but she felt really uneasy and couldn’t explain it. at one point she muttered something along the lines of, I just love you like a really good friend. (that hurt) 


One thing I’ve always known about Taylor is that she has a hard time articulating herself the moment, when put on the spot she has a really hard time putting words together and explaining herself, unlike me. I told her she needed some time to think, even though I believed she had already made up her mind (sort of implying that she wanted to break up) She cried into my shoulder for a bit and then I put her in her car and drove home. 


We didn’t talk for 4 days. I wanted to give her space to let her figure it out, but the anxiety was killing me. Eventually I broke and texted Taylor. We made small talk for a bit but eventually I asked her if she wanted to talk about what was going on. She said she did, and she wanted to talk about it in person, “but I’m not sure I’m ready yet.” She said. I told her I would be waiting for her when she was ready. I hung out with one of my buddies two days later, and he had me convinced that something more had happened at the bar, that she had cheated on me and couldn’t find the words to say it the first time. my Anxiety was thought the roof. I wasn’t eating right, I had lost 3 pounds, I wasn’t sleeping right, my mood was out of whack and it was effecting me at work. So I called her. I told her that I was sorry but I couldn’t bare to wait anymore because it was tearing me apart. she told me she wanted to meet, that day, and we set a time a place.


I drove my car to the meeting spot, A seaside park, and there she was sitting at a park bench. I sat down beside her and asked her what was on her mind. I made sure to let her get it all out and listen to what she had to say before I said anything. To summarize, she told me that she likes me more than a friend, and she doesn’t want to be just friends with me, but she has been feeling unsure about our relationship. She said she has been feeling a little tied down, and the fight about her and her co-worker made her realize that she was indeed feeling it. This was going to be her last year of college and she didn't want to miss out, and additionally she didn't know where she was going to go after she graduated. She said she didn't want to be with anyone else, but she just felt like she wanted to be alone. She thought maybe she could ignore these feelings until school started and it would go away, but she couldn’t do it anymore because she felt it was unfair to me. I treat her so well and she didn’t feel like she could match the level of love I was putting out. At this point I was shaking, I wasn’t sobbing but tears were starting to run down my face as I sat and listened to her. After she had finished, I tried to explain to her my side. I told her that we had only been together a little while, and that I didn’t expect her to be deeply in-love with me. I know that I am a very loving person, I’m more concerned with giving love and doing acts of love, like the flowers and telling her she’s beautiful, stuff like that, than receiving love. I said that for now, I was okay with being in a relationship with her as long as she felt that she did want to be with me. she said she couldn’t do that, as it didn’t feel right. The remainder of the encounter consisted of me explaining the feelings I was going though in that moment. I told her that “feeling tied down” in a guys perspective is just “ I want to bang other guys” but she told me she didn’t want to be with anyone other than me, and it wasn't about that. I asked her to explain what she meant by feeling uneasy, what did she really mean? She said she couldn’t put it into words. Then she said something thats really been tearing at me this whole time. She said **“the one thing that scares me is that I’m afraid I’ll get to school and in a few weeks time I’ll regret breaking up with you and you’ll hold it over my head.”** I told her that if she even had a single thought of regret to come to me (Looking back on it, big mistake to have said that). After saying something like that to me, how can I not wait for her, even subconsciously?!?!


I told her that I knew I had to let her go, that I couldn’t hold on to her if she wanted to leave, but I didn’t want to leave the park bench because if I did it would really be over. She said she didn’t have anywhere to go and she was okay with staying for a bit. So we just sat there together, watching ships go by. After about 20 minutes I simply looked at her and said “Go.” She kissed me on the cheek and walked to her car. Later that night she texted me saying she was so sorry about what happened.


That was 9 days ago. I have not made contact with her what-so-ever since then.
I was an absolute wreck for the first 3 days. There was random break downs, at one point I called one of my friends and just let it all pour out of me. I’m so scared she’s going to sleep with somebody else, realize she had it better off with me, and then come back, but by then it will be too late and what shell have done will hurt too much. **I’m frustrated because I treated her so well and she seemed to be so into me too and then out of the blue she just break up with me, drops me off like its no big deal to her. She hardly even gives me a real explanation. I mean she gave her reasons but they don’t make sense to me. I feel cheated.** Why did she get into a relationship with me and allow me to feel all of these feelings for her and fall for her and feel like it was reciprocated only to let me fall to the ground? Why does being with me make her feel tied down? Even if it does whats so wrong with being with me? I never told her I loved her but I did tell her I was crazy about her. And I am. She’s caring, she has very strong ties with her brother, sister, and mother. she’s so smart, she’s grounded, I mean for gods sake she pays her own way though school she pays her own car and medical bills, I guess she’s much more mature than I which makes this whole thing even harder for me because it seems like such an immature reasons to break up a perfectly functioning relationship. I really do want to be with ***her***, not just in a relationship.

23809,Breakups,2n4g8t,"My boyfriend (20M) of three years and I (20F) recently broke up. We were dating since high school and I really truly loved him. We did basically everything together. Went to the movies, shopping, to baseball games, got dinner together, and all that other stuff. We saw each other almost everyday and if we didnt see each other we still talked via texting. It's not that we were clingy or obsessed with each other we just really really enjoyed each others company. We rarely fought, never got sick of each other, had all the same interests and truly had a good relationship. We also both go to the same university.


Anyway, last week we started talking about our relationship and our future together. As we were talking my boyfriend admitted to me that he was afraid that we would end up getting married and he would regret being with the same person his entire life. (we both had long relationship before we started dating but we were both young and in high school during these other relationships). He was concerned we would be dating for so long and these feelings wouldn't go away and he would end up regretting being with me and no one else. He told me his feelings for me haven't changed and he still loves me and is happy with our relationship. He is just also having these feelings of regret that  he cant control.  After talking for hours while both of us cried we both knew that if he was having these feelings it would be best if we broke up. Neither of us wanted to break up and it was definitely the hardest thing either of us has ever had to do but we both understand it had to be done.


The thing is, I really really love him. And I wanted us to be together. I know we are both fairly young but I always thought that he was the one I wanted to marry. And I still do feel this way. I've never met a person in my life I got along with so well. I am really hoping that now that we have broken up that after a while he realizes how much he misses me. Or that he dates other people and realizes that we had was better. But I dont know what the chances of that happening are. And I dont want to spend my life waiting for him. 


Has anyone else experienced anything similar? What ended up happening? I could also really use some advice just on what to do now. And trying to talk to him is not really an option. I really appreciate the help.

23810,Infidelity,1njpfy,"So here's the problem. I have two ex-friends, we'll call them Amy (24/F) and Susan (23/F), and an ex-fiancé who we'll call Joe (24/M). I recently broke off my engagement to Joe for several reasons, including the fact that he was extremely controlling, manipulative, and I was so miserable in the relationship that it was making me physically and mentally ill. It took me months to get the courage to end it, and instead of supporting me and realizing I was in a bad place, Susan and Amy became upset with me because they were supposed to be bridesmaids and had spent time and money on the pre-wedding activities and such. 

While I was with Joe, I had met up with a manager from my work on a few occasions to help him through some personal things. We had become somewhat close months earlier over a shared tragedy, and I felt comfortable approaching him about how he needed to seek help for a current issue he was having. Any time I met up with him, it was during the day, getting coffee in a public place. When Joe and I split, my manager let me stay at his place (on the couch, completely PG) while I was trying to find an apartment as a sort of repayment for me pushing him to get help with his issues.

After the break-up, I told Amy (before I knew she was not a friend) about the coffee meet ups and that I had been staying at his place, and asked her not to mention it to Joe because this sort of thing, though completely harmless, would be frowned upon at my job. Fast forward two months later, and Amy and Susan are now telling people, including Joe, that I cheated on him with my manager. Joe is now going around telling all of my friends that I cheated on him, and even went as far as it ask one of my co-workers if I did. I am also pretty positive that he told my main manager (who he knows personally), because lately that manager has been rude to both me and the manager I was accused of cheating with. 

I am honestly not sure what it do about this. I really don't want to talk to Joe, but if I have to I will. I just don't know how to approach it, or if I should let it blow over. I just know that if it gets out at my job then I will automatically be assumed as guilty because my job is a breeding ground for drama and rumors.

23816,Breakups,2dw0sf,"Backstory:

We had been together for about 16 months when we broke up. I clicked with her family and we had many of the same interests so everything just fitted. She was perfect to me. Had a great personality, our sense of humor was the same and she had a body like no other.

My ex and I had some issues in the end of the relationship. I had a tough time because I was the one she would talk to about family and school problems, and there were a lot. Although I had a great time with her family, it was shit. I had thought about being single, a couple of months before we broke up, but I loved her and I would do anything to support her. Even though her problems took a toll on me, I kept going. She had just gotten a job so she wouldn't be as dependent on her family money-wise. This was a huge step. She began paying back people she owed money, and even though there were still problems, it helped out. She also talked about moving out of the house and live near me and our school. (She lived about 20km outside of town, but in an area where the only bus driving, was the schoolbus. If we were planning anything during the weekend or outside of school, she would sleep at my place because she would have no way of going home)

The break-up was very confusing, but the short version is that she didn't feel like we were BF and GF anymore besides sex. She wrote this on Facebook just when I was heading to work and that got me annoyed to the point where I came to think of all the problems she had and that, plus work, kept me from thinking about what I wrote.

All of a sudden we were no longer a couple and that didn't hit me until it was to late. I went to her place immediately after work and apologized for everything. She said that everything was fine, be she wanted a break. It held up for about a week, and then she wanted to break up for good.

Main story:

My ex uses Tumblr alot, and since I'm not on it, she writes whatever the hell she wants, and because I still loved her and didn't think I went through her whole Tumblr history since our break-up. She had been to a gaming convention a couple of days prior to a break-up, and she had a text-post where she explained that she had just experienced the hottest thing in a long time. She had been sitting on this guys lap (let's call him Alex) and they had gone through all of the porn-blogs she followed. He had his hands on her hips and she wrote that she could feel his hands tighten and his eyes lighten up. This made her horny.

As far as I know, they didn't do anything besides that at the gaming convention, but after her and I had broken up, they began to see each other. From what I saw on her Tumblr, they had been doing everything. They had been at it since at least a couple of days after the break-up.

Right now, I'm in a grey zone. We are in class together for at least another year so No contact isn't an option. Do I let her know that I know or do I just let it pass and stay quiet?

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been married for approximately a year and a half. My relationship with my wife can be regarded as stable. We understand each other. I have not issues with her, nor does she with I. 

A workplace colleague joined our team. She is single. I've been starting to feel an emotional and physical attachment towards her. It's physical attraction but nothing to the point of wanting to sleep with her. I am attracted to her intellectual nature as well as physical.  We have similar traits and interests and that has made my feelings stronger. I am constantly thinking about her after work and during work and feel happy when she texts or see her. 

I have not said anything to anyone.  I am posting here for the first time. I know there are others who have been through this. I am considering switching locations to get out of this environment

I've dated Carmen for 2 years, and it's been wonderful. She spent some teenage years abroad in the United States, and she manifests herself in more liberated ways than other women here. Sex life has been good, too. We recently went on a small vacation together where everything was fine. 

Recently, we had an argument about some trivial subjects, including her contributions to our dating expenses. We are both students, but my part time job pays more than hers. Still, she paid almost nothing even though she makes 60% of what I do. This would not be a problem (I can understand that she might have more student loans, more difficult family situation, etc), except for the fact that she spends irresponsibly on her personal items, such as buying expensive make-up, shoes, clothes, etc. 

This fight led to us not talking for a while. In that time, I learned that she had gone to a male friend of hers, whom I do not know, who is a professional photographer. She posed nude for him for a series of photos, and sent them to me a few days later. While I begrudgingly admit the artistic merit of some of them, they were overtly sexual and provocative, and definitely involved full nudity. Even featured some sex toys I recognized (no penetration of any kind, however). She also hinted that she thinks the photographer is interested in her, but maintained that she did not do anything. 

I'm at a loss. I can't even figure out what is going on in this girl's head. I don't know if I should be mad or how much. The original argument seems to pale in response to this. How do I respond?

1.) Three years ago, I broke off a 7 year relationship with a girl I knew from childhood that I still loved but had grown apart from. After a year I was still not ready for another relationship, but she had already moved on and gotten married. 

2.) I starting dating again but had no feelings for anyone I was dating, even after several dates with girls that seemed amazing on paper. One ended up asking me to become mutual with her and I agreed. I was lucky and ended up having feelings for her, we even got engaged after a year and some months of dating, but I found out she was cheating on my left and right and was even living with another guy. I was absolutely devastated for 6 months. I gained 40 lbs and have stretch marks all over my stomach. I thought I was never going to love again, I quit my six-figure job and started doing drugs and partying almost everyday.

3.) I moved to a different city for a new job and through chance met an amazing girl from another country. Her personality is so unique and even though I was sure I was never going to love again I forgot everything when I saw her. She was love at first site and she felt the same way about me. She had a ton of personal issues at the time and felt like I was a gift from god to her (she doesn't believe in god). After 2 months she had to return back to her country so we decided to do long distance. Her friends back home are very welthy and arranged for me to visit her country, so two weeks ago I arrived and everything was like it was before we parted. We had amazing times together every day and amazing sex everyday. 

We got into our first fight last Sunday (which I thought was rather minor) and she just went completely stoic and said she wanted to end things. She walked out of our hotel and returned home for two days - I stood outside for 5 hours in the cold with flowers and she came down and we went back to the hotel and talked, she said she had made up her mind so I went to bed. I woke up the next morning with her next to me and hugged her. 

Things that week were back to normal until yesterday she was complaining about everything we were doing (too cold, too boring, etc.). I was a little stressed so said let's go back to the hotel and relax, and the cab ride home was silent. We get back and she breaks up with me again, this time she says it is for real and that anytime we get into a little fight it's a huge problem for her because we have a language barrier and she can't explain herself and resolve it. She has a ton of personal issues and tried once to kill herself before she met me. 

She says she has too many problems to love and when we get into even little fights, she realizes she can't deal with love and her problems so she needs to cut me loose. I feel like love has abandoned me and this second time I can't show up with flowers again, I don't know what to do. I want her to have something to live for (me as well).

Being alone for as long as I have you learn to cherish the bonds shared between people unlike most guys. I've beaten my depression yet I feel this dark empty void in my heart. I think she might be what's missing in my life. I've only felt this way about a girl once before.

23844,Infidelity,1iaqcf,"I think maybe the answer seems obvious at first, but it would help to hear answers from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Especially people who have left someone for others. I'd like your input on what was going through your head and if the new relationship worked out.

This has happened to me more than once in the recent past. The first time, when I realized a guy (who was taken) was developing feelings for me, I didn't let it go anywhere because I would never want to be that woman. He told me he was planning on leaving his girlfriend, but I was too wary of the situation. He had been flirting with me while he was still in a relationship, and even if he said he was going to end it, it seemed weird. If your relationship was in a bad enough place where you're sending sexy texts to another girl, why wouldn't you have already left? Maybe I was judging him too harshly but I have been cheated on and I absolutely didn't want to be the other woman.

I recently started getting the feeling that a different guy (also in a relationship) has feelings for me. I don't know much about the relationship, if it's at its end or not, but I know with absolute certainty that he is a good guy. One of the least-scummy guys I've ever met. He's never tried to pull any moves on me, but I can tell by the attention he gives me that he is into me. When we talk, we just click and he acts incredibly interested in my life and my interests. It hasn't been long enough for us to actually discuss the fact that he's in a relationship, nor has it been long enough for me to say he should have left her by now (I'm talking barely even a couple of weeks here). My questions are these:

* Do I cut off all ties before I find out? 
* Is it possible to be a truly good person who develops feelings for someone else while you're already in a relationship?
* Has anyone been in a situation where they left someone for another person, and the new relationship worked out?
 
Obviously time will tell. If he were to leave her very soon and still maintain decent behavior toward me and do things the right way, I would probably trust him. I just need to know if it's a bad sign right off the bat. I've been cheated on more than once, and I don't want to miss any initial red flags.

tl;dr: Is it a red flag *every single time* a guy who is in a relationship shows feelings for you? Or can good people fall in love with someone else? Has anyone in this situation ended up successful in their new relationship, without any cheating or dishonesty?","If a guy has feelings for you before he leaves his girlfriend, is it a red flag?

23845,Breakups,1mqdf9,"I want him to say these words: I've stopped drinking since you left me. I've been putting all the money I would be spending on alcohol into a banking account for us. I want to work together to build it and use it to work for our goals. I want your help managing my finances so I can start paying off my debts and paying my child support. I'm ready to be a dad and a partner for you. I want your best interest to become our best interest. I want my best interest to become our best interest. I am ready to give and accept support as we sober up and move wholeheartedly through life together.

I want to build you up, not tear you down. I want to show you how much I value your input by putting it into action. I want to try out your ideas and share mine so I can watch you make them come to life. I want to work together to create something bigger than we could do on our own.

I can't control him. I can't make him say those things. I can't shove any more of my ideas down his throat or he's going to resent me, he'll see me as my controlling mother and leave me. Worse, he'll just say what he knows I want to hear, because it sounds great to him as he's saying it. Who doesn't want to be the hero? But then he feels that it can all be uncomfortable and requires a degree of focus... The poor guy just doesn't know what to do, and hasn't learned to use his creative mind to build a life with someone. Meanwhile, I'm too impatient to see him through in hopes he will meet my expectations. 

He's got all the right stuff, he's just lost in his alcoholism and hasn't had the right experiences to make him more mature. We both desperately want and love each other. We want to be with each other, but we are both wishy-washy and can't handle when things are less than movie-perfect. I am quick to back away. Hell, I've broken up with him 4 times now. Each time, he came back with sincere apologies and promises and I took him back, dreamy-eyed. Soon, he is feeling inadequate and the sparkle has faded from his ambition and he wants to try so hard, but he can't muster up the enthusiasm. I know how this feels, as I myself am caught in the depression-alcohol cycle. I know the reasons why I don't want to be in a relationship are still there after he's gone. I find them in myself. I am putting out his fires while stoking my own. I have literally gotten myself a beer after getting upset with him about his inappropriate drinking. 

I told myself I can be better for the next person. I won't make these mistakes again. My other half says: Well, if that's the case, then make these changes now. Be the person you want to be now, and give this relationship a fighting chance. Give yourself a chance at happiness. Give your son a chance at having two parents. A week ago, he was sitting in your room, telling you he wants to spend his life with you. Was it that you didn't believe him? Maybe it was the fact that he prefaced with I'm afraid you are going to fall in love with someone else and I'll have lost you forever. Maybe it's because he knows you are lovers with one of your female friends and wants to fulfill that fantasy all boys have. And you don't have the heart to tell him she is 'Mine' and not 'Ours'.

Anyway, what choice did I have? She and I both had been living and creating families with boys who eventually decided I can't. We need each other and our friendship has led to intimacy. I can't say it's a coincidence he's begging for another chance. 

It's been a rough week. I'm in love with a child in a man's body. He wants to grow. I want to grow. However we are unwilling to let go of the consumerist, addictive, disconnected, distracted, lazy, half-assed bullshit culture we live in, and I guess here we sit and stew, alone, until we pull ourselves out of it. I'm scared to death we can't do it without each other, but the past 2 years haven't done me much good in terms of overall growth either. Also I know that's bullshit. I can do it myself, and that's just another excuse. How do you know when it's time to cut your losses and begin to rebuild? I'm prone to say As soon as you both stop trying. Don't waste a single second. And that's how we have broken up 4 times now. 

Anyway, I love this person and I see him in 10 years as everything I know he can be. I wish he could do that for me, right now. I'm so impatient and I know I have to lose that or it will make me miserable my whole life in so many ways. 

The bottom line is, my son deserves better. He deserves a better mother who can put down her beer, get off her ass and run around the park or clean the fucking house. He deserves a father figure who sticks up for his partner and takes him camping like it's no big deal. Together or apart, we have to get better or we are just slowly dying, wasting all that we have to offer the world. Right now it seems like apart is best, and the day after we cried on the phone and I cried harder than I've cried in many years, I am clinging to any hope that his love for me will motivate him to change his priorities and be a family man instead of an immature little boy. I am clinging to any hope that we can do it together.

I've recently moved in with my girl. Since then, I've begun texting an old male friend of mine who is in the army. Him and I don't talk much. Well, I dated him back in High School when I was still trying to convince myself that I was straight. 

This boy and I have always had a great friendship. My girlfriend got really upset that I was talking to him again. She's now decided that it doesn't bother her that my male friend and I are rekindling our friendship. I know that is her putting up a fuck it wall, though.

Also, I have a friend who is a fellow lesbian. She and I text and we joke around often. I haven't even met her, though. We began talking over the internet a good while back.

I had made a sexual joke, my friend made one joking comment back, then we proceeded on with our conversation regarding a party she'd gone to the night before.

After getting her to ask her friend what happened, the two of them walked off and ended up at a bus stop (the rest of the group went home in a cab).

She promises me it meant nothing but admits she was attracted to him and that she was flattered by the attention. She cannot remember what happened after they left, she says they may have kissed but she thinks she would have remembered.

I was hesitant to start another serious relationship after her and my experiences in the previous months but I asked her out anyway. We've been officially together for 5 months.

Things have gotten very serious between my girlfriend and I over the past few months. She will often say things that hint at us having a life together. I know she thinks I'm the one. But I don't want to get married until my late 20s at the earliest, and I want to be single again at some point before I get married.

We saw each other every day when we were at school. Now during the summer, we live about an hour and a half away. We had half joked about a threesome before, but only when we weren't having sex a few times a day did it start to become a reality. We found a girl on Tinder, smoked weed with her in a hot tub, and I ended up getting head from both of them. My girlfriend quickly found out that she was very straight and very jealous and started having numerous anxiety attacks. The next day, she became even clingier than usual, and also said that I wasn't allowed to be alone with the other girl. So since I hate girlfriends telling me what to do, I did just that. And even though I didn't intend on cheating on my girlfriend when I went and visited the other girl, she came on to me and I was high so I couldn't resist her.

I also told her that I was leaving for a month to go to a mental hospital in Baltimore, where my dad and stepmom live, to get treatment for my Depression. Of course she was angry, but she also wants to try and make things work. Meanwhile, I feel crushing guilt every time I look at her or talk to her, and I'm afraid she's harboring resentment against me at the same time.

We usually text back and forth every day or every couple days. I think she is into me because she texts me first when I don't and she had scheduled 1 out of the 3 dates we have been on.

I'm no experienced in dating, and actually this is my first time dating someone.. ( I think we're dating???)

I've been having a lot of confused feelings on whether she wants to keep hanging out and talking to each other. 

And we haven't talking in about 3 days (which is unusual) and I'm waiting for her to text first because I've texted her first the last few times, and i asked her out last weekend and she said her weekend was fully busy (which i sorta believe).

So back to my confused feelings. I want a way where I can straight up text her asking her if she wan'ts to keep talking and going out. Like a way that she will have to give me a yes or no answer.

23886,Infidelity,20uaje,"Last weekend, my boyfriend and I went to visit a childhood friend of his that he hadn't seen in over a decade. She lives in a city 300 miles away, and while we stayed at a hotel, we spent the days with the friend, her newlywed absolutely charming husband, her mom (whom we'll call Mom) and her grandmother (whom we'll call Grandma, because clarity).

We all had a grand time: the husband was lovely and absolutely devoted to his wife. The mom was sweet and funny to everybody, and the grandma was raunchy and hilarious. My SO has known her family all his life. It was a bit awkward for my SO and his friend at first, since they hadn't talked in 10 years, but they quickly got friendly again.

**My SO and his friend had never dated or been anything but platonic friends**

When we got back home from the weekend, the friend started sending my SO some inappropriate texts. She was asking about whether he'd had feelings for her when they were younger, saying that seeing him again brought memories of feelings to her. She started wondering about how things would have turned out if she'd dated my SO. She started talking about how everybody thought that they were dating when they were younger, and maybe they should have. Most concerning, she seemed to dismiss our relationship and dismiss her wonderful husband.


She is coming into town in a month, and over the weekend I had welcomed her to stay with us. Now she's asking my SO if they'll have time alone to talk and if PinkSodaPopTumbler will always be around

I am concerned, and distressed. I feel horrible for her lovely husband. I feel horrible for her family that we just spent a weekend with. 

My SO was uncomfortable with it at first, and with guidance from me, told her clearly that he had never thought about her that way when they were younger, and that he likes how their lives have turned out.

Still, she continues to text about the subject. Every day. She calls him when she has 5 minutes to spare during her day. She stays up way late, past her husband's bedtime, to text my SO. My SO continues to engage her on the subject because he thinks he's made himself clear, and it's now just harmless speculation.


To be clear, I know my SO won't be cheating on me. But this is awful behavior coming from a married woman, and I'm concerned that this will end very badly and ruin my SO's relationship with her family, whom he deeply cares about.

**tl;dr**: Married childhood friend of my SO is hitting on him via text. He thinks it's harmless.

EDIT: I'm also concerned about the high drama potential of this situation. I hate drama, and I hate when nice people get hurt. If her husband or her mom (who was close to my SO when he was a kid) discovers these texts, they'll be distraught.

EDIT 2: I forgot to add that my SO and I are in an honest and loving open relationship. If his friend had been single, I wouldn't have cared about them hooking up.

23892,Dating,2esawi,"Alright so I met this guy online, we were both playing video games and we have been talking on Skype every since we met in a group skype chat with other online friends that play this game. I am very very close with everyone in this chat, we have all played together for the past 7 years. (except Daniel, he just joined 1 year ago).


Okay so the first couple weeks it was just normal we played video games all about 3-4 hours a day and we all skyped in the group chat as we did. Then me and Daniel started to get a lot closer.

I am a very very closed off person, I have friends that I've been friends with for all of my life that don't know half of the things about me Daniel does. He is just so easy to open up too, I told him things I've never told anyone about my childhood and he's told me things that nobody knows about him too. I have never in my life met someone that I feel like I can trust like I trust him.

Because I am a private person, and because of some things that happened to me growing up I find it extremely difficult to trust anyone but this guy just, I honestly have know idea what it is but I feel like I can tell him anything. It's like I've known him forever. 

We live 1.5 hours away from each other which isn't too horrible considering we met online and we could have been in other countries or something.


But here's the thing, I really feel like I am falling in love with him but physically I do not find him attractive. I think he feels the same way about me, actually I'm pretty positive so I'm not even going to get into that. But he wants to start meeting up and hang out in person.

I really like this guy, i've never felt this way about anyone. But I don't know what to do if I don't physically feel attracted to him, only emotionally. I don't mean to sound shallow it's just I can't help it. Physical attraction is a big part of any relationship. 

I do admit though that since I have known him I find him better looking the longer I know him (even though nothing has changed in the way he looks), but still I am not attracted to him.


I don't know what to do. Should I meet up with him and hope that the chemistry is magically there? I really like him and I feel horrible for feeling this way. He is everything I could want in a guy, and I want to be attracted to him in that way so badly, but I'm not. I have no idea what to do or how to proceed.

23893,Dating,271v8e,"My life is confusing right now. Some background: I am on a break (maybe broken up? The line is blurry) with my boyfriend of 11 months [21M]. I still really care about him, he still really cares about me, but he has some life issues he really needs to sort through. He has issues expressing/feeling/dealing with his emotions and started using alcohol as a coping mechanism. He's trying to work through these issues and sober up, but I realized our relationship was probably hindering him from doing that. Also, in the mean time, he was becoming more and more resentful towards me.  

Enter my best friend. We've been tight since the very first day of our freshman year in college. Lived in the same dorm for 2 years, kept hanging out the 3rd year. He was dating his high school girlfriend for the first 2 years of college, but broke up during the summer when she cheated on him. Dated a high school senior from his home town out of state after that for about 8 months. I've had boyfriends off and on during the course of our friendship as well. He supported me through at least 2 break ups, but we never dated or hooked up or did anything physical AT ALL. 

He's an amazing guy. He's smart and funny and good looking and my family loves him (my mother is practically offering to bribe me to date him). Yesterday, he took me on a date (though he didn't say it was a date until it was already happening. I sort of assumed it was just us hanging out like we always do). He did everything right. He took me to sushi, bought me ice cream, went to my favorite candy store and bought this gourmet licorice as a gift for my family when I mentioned me and my mom loooove black licorice. We went back to my house (I'm living there just for the summer) and shook my parents hands. We watched a movie, and when it was time for him to go home, he asked to kiss me. 

My response? A mental ooooohhhh shit. I told him it was pretty soon after my breakup for me to be thinking about dating again. He said he was a patient man, and that he didn't mind in the slightest. I gave him a quick kiss before he went anyway because I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but I now regret doing that. 

I don't think I'm sexually attracted to him. It doesn't make sense. I think he's handsome. He works out and takes care of himself and smells good and does everything right. We have tons of friend chemistry (we can laugh and talk for hours no problem), but I've never wanted to kiss him or hold his hand or pursue anything more than friendship. Am I crazy? Is there something wrong with me? If I could flip a switch and be attracted to him in that way, I definitely would. He's everything I could possibly want on paper. 

In your experience, does sexual attraction or chemistry ever come with time? Is there no hope for this?

Over the holidays we were chatting online discussing all sorts - old schools, board games, posters on our wall. It then moved onto serious stuff like the expectations of society, our diminishing individuality as a result of the pressures on our lives. This lead naturally onto mental illness and stress. She expressed her dissatisfaction with her life and feeling worthless. I empathised with these emotions as we are both of a similar age (20, 21). Of course we both discussed getting professional help if the need arose (personally my mental health is at an acceptable state for now). She continued for a bit with her worries and no-one liking her and the common question of whether her friends actually were her friends. I insisted that I was and chose that moment to express that I found her attractive. The response was one of gratitude. I was not expecting reciprocation considering the circumstances but I was concerned post-conversation that this may have been interpreted as pity when in fact it was genuine or that it was poorly timed considering the subject matter. I am curious of people's opinions. The conversation flowed naturally after that, talking about LOTR and other nerdy stuff. I will be seeing her again in January, suggestions?

We were doing so well during November and middle of December and we were happy, at least I think we were. We were seeing each other often, had sex, and enjoying our time together.

When the holidays came by however, he got really moody, and didn't spend time with my during the holidays except for Christmas Eve, because he had traditions with his friends which was understandable. However, I got really furious with him on Christmas because he said he was busy, but he was with his friends and family, but I felt that he wouldn't give me an hour of his time to see me. So after that I got angry and wrote things out of anger:





I just don't understand. I just don't understand why we only talk during night time especially really late at night. Lately, I keep thinking to myself maybe I've been selfish or I'm  blaming myself a lot for too many things. But, now I'm sure I'm not selfish because I'm always adjusting to your favor. I just don't understand why I adjust to your schedule all the time. How come we always hang out super late in the afternoon (more like night time)? You already know I can't be out late at night after I mentioned it so much. So why do we do this? Why can't you fix your sleep cycle and sleep like a normal person does instead of being up until 6am or 7am on Netflix. Why am I always the one asking to hang out or ask to Skype? Why am I the one initiating things? Why am I always driving to your house. Why can't you hang out at mine more often? Why do I feel like crap when I play video games at my house and you end up being on your phone all the time when you visit. It's okay being on your phone but if you're attached with it 90% of the time it's rude and I feel like crap. But when I watch you play a game at least I try it or have some interest. I actually make the damn effort to understand your interests.  I was super upset since black friday. You said you wanted to spend time with me and at last minute you tell me you're bringing Harry. That's pretty inconsiderate since it was a last minute notice...just like you planning to bring YOUR FRIENDS to MY BIRTHDAY hang out for archery. I thought it was just us.  That's like me having a birthday party in the past with my friends and they end up bringing strangers to my home. I ENDED UP CRYING. I HATE IT. I feel like you're doing the same and it upsets me. It's like you have to bring your friends all the time. I don't dislike them, but the thought of you doing that makes me feel sad. How would you feel if I invited all MY friends to your birthday party but not  your actual friends? What hurt me more was the fact that you hung out with your friends at Starbucks and also had time to hang with Kennedy during Christmas. If you had time with your family but also your friends I just don't understand why you can't give me an hour of your time..JUST AN HOUR at least to hang out. You are always hanging with them at night at Starbucks whether its school season or not. All I wanted was to watch fucking Christmas lights with you just like last year. It's Christmas, shouldn't you spend time with your family, friends, and significant others!? I asked my guy friends and they said it was odd that you didn't on Christmas day .  I'm not asking for anything expensive or a physical item. I'm not asking for anything difficult that's going to pull your arm or leg. I just want to spend time with you outside. It's sad because who does that on Christmas!? Who does that. I was at home and I didn't really do anything with my family. I just wish you put more effort when you're free. I'm pushing so hard to make you happy but I wish you did the same.  I feel so sad. Small actions make me happy I'm not asking for a lot. I really I'm not. I haven't stopped crying because I'm constantly frustrated. I'm sorry, so sorry for dumping this on you. I just can't be a strong person to suck it up and deal with it (and not talk about it) and think I'm the one being selfish.  We're in a relationship to communicate, but even I failed to talk to you face to face. I'm only confident in expressing myself through typing or writing because I have the time to put my thoughts in together. I'm not asking you to change, I just want you to realize you're hurting my feelings and you're being inconsiderate. I don't want you to reply back to this because I know you don't like typing/texting a lot. I just want you to understand how I feel. I don't want to be yelled at. I don't want you to lash at me. I'm scared and I'm afraid to send this to you because I'm afraid it might start an argument.






We didn't talk about our problems, we didn't hang out until Friday, but when I was at his house he was so focused on his phone that he wasn't paying attention to the clip we were watching on Netflix. I felt furious and wanted to cry, I told him I can leave if you want if you are so attached to your phone. I rather not be here if you are like that. Then his friends called him up to go to Starbucks, but he asked if I wanted to go, but I was hesitant because of the tension we were having. So, then he asked me Do you not like my friends? and I told him I like them I don't have problems with them. I just feel like we hang out with them so much, and I haven't had the chance to spend time with him since Christmas Eve. The plans changed, and we had dinner with them at a food court but we sat at separate tables. I felt like when we said good bye I gave him the hardest hug I could possibly give him and we kissed good bye. In my head I felt like something was dying.





That night when we talked I told him I feel sad still that he was on his phone so much, and I mentioned how I am still upset when I sent that note to him. He was like do you want to talk about it? And I said no, because I felt that we were really angry and I regret not talking about this issue. I felt that its not right to talk when you're not level-headed. Then the night ended.




The next day he broke up with me through email:




I’m going to be honest with you that I haven’t been happy these past months. It has been unfair that I can’t really tell you how I feel and it is unfair that you are being hurt because you don’t know how I feel. I feel that you do not give me a chance to tell you how I really feel. I feel like the time we spent together you don’t even know who I really am. The more I got to know you the more distant I got. I got to a point where I can’t tell you everything because you either do not want to hear about the subject matter or I filter and censor what I have to say to you because you do not relate to it or are disgusted on the topic. Honestly on your birthday I didn’t invite my friends to archery on your birthday it was a coincident that they wanted to do it on the same thing that day. I told them that it was your birthday that day and I told them about how you had a bad experience and that you wanted to try archery and try out kbbq. My friends and I thought it would be a good idea to try everything in one day and have a birthday party together. But if you didn’t like that idea then we would do something else and we did. I also called different places to take you archery so we could be together by ourselves but no one was available. I know what happened to you and I thought I could surprise you with a birthday experience. I was hurt and still hurt about what you had written to me about that day.
If you really want to know why I do not like hang out at your house is because it is so negative there. How your family talk to you and we generally end up around my area if we do go anywhere. I do not mind using my car to drive but it’s just my opinion. On black Friday I invited Harry because we made plans a week ahead to go shopping at 2am and you wanted to go shopping too so why not just take one car? I pushed back harry so I could bring you along on the shopping adventure. I didn’t have to be with him the whole time if you didn’t want to but I tried to make the best on carpooling on the busiest shopping day. My friends mean a lot to me and we have our own traditions together for many years already. During the holidays I get really busy. Kennedy called me on Christmas Eve to hang out but I couldn’t and he asked me to meet him up on Christmas day. He just got back and hit me up first and I haven’t seen him for months. Plus I had family that day too. Christmas Eve is more important than Christmas day in my point of view and Christmas isn’t special to me. Spending time with you on Christmas Eve was more eventful to me.  It is hard telling you how I feel. You make it sound that I am lecturing you all the time and I feel bad so I just hold it in and deal with it. It was good talking to you on skype but recently you have been gaming all the time and more focus on  the game than talking to me so I keep myself distracted and not looking just at you play. It doesn’t bother me that much but when you start calling me by a different name multiple times that kind of suck but I got over it. The more I got to know you the more I realized that we are really different. I understand where you are coming from but do you know where I am coming from? From my background or my own personality? How can I connect with someone when they don’t really know me?
 It is hard to incorporate you with my friends. They ask about you and how you are doing and why I do not bring you around. It feels like you only know me on how I am just with you but the other half is what I do with my friends and family and you do not really see that. I do not want to change who you are because that is who you are. I am not going to change who I am because I know who I am and I’m not intending to change that. If I seem inconsiderate is because I have to deal with a lot of things on my own for a very long time and I grew to be independent and because of that I can seem inconsiderate to other people. I don’t want this to turn into a blame game because there is no one to blame. I am sorry if I have treated you unfairly and bad but I am doing what I can to juggle my life together. I got my life straight for once and I am keeping with the plan at hand. With school coming up around the corner I am going to be busier than normal. I’ll be at school more often and my sleeping habit isn’t going to change because of school. I found that this is most productive for school and it worked out so it is a vital factor for my schooling. But at the end of the day I feel like when I do hang out with you or talk to you is that I feel horrible afterwards. Like there was nothing left there but an empty void. I feel like whatever I do isn’t good enough or you are not happy afterwards.
As I am writing this I feel like this is the only way to get through you. You don’t want to talk about our problems in person or on skype and I can understand how hard it is to confront someone but ignoring this is not going to change the fact that I am not happy. The only thing I can say is to agree with you and not fight back. Because I know what you said how you did not want to talk to me about the issue but we did need to and you postponing it is really hurting our relationship. I do not know how to fix this anymore. I dealt with this for so long already that I am at my breaking point now. I don’t know what to do or say but I know how I really feel now and I want to break up with you. I don’t think this is a healthy relationship that keeps hurting the both of us. I do not regret the time I spent with you. I do not regret anything but I already know that this relationship isn’t going to work out anymore. My feelings towards you has change and I don’t think you or me can change how I feel now. It hurts too much to go on and I am done feeling like this for the past couple months. You have no idea how long I have been feeling like this. I try to work it out and do what I can with what I got to work with but it’s just too much for me to deal with emotionally. I just feel angry all the time and I hate feeling angry. My friends notice how I have become a bitter person lately and it’s because I am not happy at all. But without communication and not trying to push you to do things that you do not want took a toll on me. Even at this moment and time I can’t talk to you because I know how I feel and I hope this letter explains some things that has been going on but this is how I feel and this is how I felt for some time but I wish I could tell you sooner and stop the heart aches that I put you through. This is how it came out and I do not know what else to say but I hope that you can understand what I’ve been going through and if you don’t then I have nothing else to say. I just hope with all the things that is going in your life you should change what don’t like about your life. Keep going forward and never look back. Reach out to your dreams and what you really want in life. Btw you are not going to reach me tomorrow or Monday because I am going to be out of town to deal with school. I could write back to you with any concerns or anything to clear up but I really do not want to talk to you until you have read this and have a clear calm mind set. I do not want to be yelled at or talk to you when you are emotionally unstable.





We actually talked on Skype again, but the way we ended things, there was no argument, we didn't yell at each other, and didn't do anything out of hand. I just tried to stay calm as possible without breaking down. I just wanted to stay strong. I asked if we should take a break because I think its a fixable problem based on his concerns with the email he sent me. I felt like he put this upon himself by not speaking up, and he should man up to his promise to communicate. I am no better either, but I do not want to talk about problems until both sides are calm. Why talk about problems while having a screaming match you know? He told me there will be no second chances, and that he knows who he is and he said it will not work out at all. I did ask him if he honestly had any feelings left, but he said a little but It won't change how I feel now. However, I feel like everyone is different in each relationship. I noticed that I matured a lot through my past ones. I just didn't understand why he couldn't just tell me these problems. Why build up something small and make it so big and get all mad about it. He's being silly by bottling it. You're going to have to let it out whether its good or ugly. Otherwise this relationship is one-sided which is how it ended. He said we could be friends as long as we didnt talk about this stuff.




We haven't talked, because I decided to not contact him until I worked on myself. I mean I made drastic changes immediately, cut my hair, work out, see my friends, shop. I didn't want to sit at home because I know that if i sit and mope around I will not feel any better. Right now I'm a bit better, Yes, I do care about him still. He's not a bad guy, but I think he can't handle problems as well as I thought he could.
If you're curious, I had problems last year with my family, education, and with my health. My health was at my worst because I had a skin condition with unknown reasons. I recovered though! So there was a lot of ups and downs.




His friend, Danny reached out to me the other day, we had a talk and he said Bond was still looking at my social media stuff. Danny said Bond was proud of me because I started working out again. Because I put that off for 4 years, and he noticed that I was trying to turn my life around.




I don't know if there will be a second chance, I just know I'm on the right path so far doing things for myself by setting my priorities straight. Its sad to see good things going my way but my relationship is not part of that. I basically became the girl that he didn't fall for anymore, and I lost it. His friend said there was one girl that Bond gave a second chance to, because she made him laugh or something like that. Well, it didn't work out because she found out she was lesbian. Danny also said since he and Bond are similar (scary similar) it's hard for Bond to open up to others. He keeps to himself and is very personal. Danny said that none of his friends had any bad blood with me, and I was generally liked a lot. They all know I'm quiet, but I'm not an asshole they all know I mean well and the fact that I'm friendly with everyone. Just...really shy. Big groups of people scare me and it's overwhelming to talk over people or when people talk over you.

On the second week I got accepted to the school of my choice, and I broke the no contact rule. I felt that If I did not thank him for the times we had our talks about school I felt that it would be rude to do so. So, after I got my acceptance letter I texted and called the people who supported me constantly. Btw I am not the best student, but I am finally getting out of a community college after 4 years being stuck there with a 1.9 gpa, which was brought up to a 2.50. So, it was a huge struggle for me. So, I wrote:






I know I'm not ready to talk to you, but it wouldn't be fair if I didn't tell you. Those talks we had about school and how I should change things,...It's going to happen. I just wanted to let you know that our talks about school and changing things really impacted me. I know you repeat yourself a lot about it, but it was never a waste, it was never in vain. I was always listening. I got into [school of my choice - censored] and I wanted to let you know. Thank you for always being patient. Thank you for always being kind. Thank you for our talks. You are my inspiration because of your accomplishment to Pomona too. I will try harder in school and graduate this time. I wish the same for you.



By the way, Bond and I are somewhat living in mirror lives.  He was stuck in a community college for 7 years so, he finally got to the school of his choice. So, something like this was a huge struggle for the both of us. He did however, responded positively:




Congratulations in getting accepted to [ School name here]. I knew you could do it. I noticed that you are turning your life around and good for you to change for the better. It's going to be tough but this is what growing up is all about. The challenges in life. Just don't give up or give into pressure. Relax, calm down, and make the right choice. I'm glad things are working out. Best of luck to you at your new school.





Then, I haven't talked to him since.





After I feel like, I'm better mental &amp; physically. I will talk to him again, but I'm not sure how to start with that yet. My friend and her husband suggest I write him an email because its less desperate and gives him time to think about what to say next. Plus, I don't want to catch him at a bad time when he's out or busy. I'm not the best at texting, because I have banana fingers. I had others say 





How can you be so happy and all of a sudden it goes down to sh*t? I just feel hurt that he said I don't know him at all. The fact that he thinks I'm not happy around him, but if I wasn't I would have left a long time ago.





I really want to re-mend our relationship, but I'm not sure what to do. He's a good guy. I know he's a really good guy for me, and I'm not saying it because he broke up with me. I'm not going to erase a good guy out of my life, but I'm definitely giving me some me time to work out stuff on my own before I see him again. Probably go for coffee or something.

----------------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr: Bond can't confront me with his problems. He kept it to himself a lot and think I don't feel happy around him. If I wasn't I'd probably broken up with him a long time ago. Anyway, He made a small issue into a big issue, and it took over. Now, relationship is dead (with bs excuses!) I want to re-mend the relationship, and don't know what to do. If you want to ask questions I will respond back. My thoughts are all over the place so I apologize if it doesn't make sense.","Me [23/F] with my boyfriend [25 M] of 1.3 years, broke up with communication issues while being confused after wards, can this relationship be re-mended?",0.0,False,5.0,5.0,1390595879.0,/r/relationships/comments/1w27ku/me_23f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_13_years_broke/,Romantic
23898,Breakups,1pha6h,"I've been with my girlfriend pretty much my whole life.  It's a given that we are going to be getting engaged at some point next year and that we will have children and get a house and grow old together and all that stuff.

From the outside we have a great relationship, but in reality we have a lot of issues and I think our relationship sucks and that we are both in it because it's easier than being alone.

She suffers from depression and I hate dealing with it.  I am emotionally distant and have trouble communicating my feelings thoughts and emotions (and she values communication very highly).  We don't share many of the same interests.  I value my alone time, she wants to be in constant contact and takes it personally if I want to be in a separate room of the house from her.  It depresses me I've only been with one women (her).

Despite all of these problems, we can't easily break up.  We share our money and don't have much of it.  Which means if we broke up she would end up staying in the apartment we share with her sister taking a quality of life hit as she would lose half her income with me gone.  I would have to move in with my mother for at least a short while, and I would rather live out of a car than do that.  But I can't drive and don't own a car. ha.

Neither of us really have any friends so we would be alone.  When I was in college I failed at making friends and spent all my time alone in my dorm feeling very depressed about the situation and don't want to go back to that.

I hate to think about how weird it would be talking to my family about having broken up with her.  We're a package deal and have been since age 15.  The idea of telling people we broke up and having to explain it to literally every person who knows me leaves me feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed.

**TLDR:  I've been with this girl for eight years and there is a lot of pressure on me to get engaged and progress the relationship but I feel we have some serous issues and want to break up.  But doing so would cause so many problems that I don't want to do it because it's easier to just be unhappy.**","[Me 23M, her 24F] I've been with this girl for eight years, since we were both 15, and I want out of the relationship.

23899,Infidelity,1p2j4v,"My wife (I'll call her O) and I started dating when we were both 20.  From the very beginning there was another guy (I'll call him Cameron) who was seven years older than her who kept trying to ignite some sort of relationship with her.  He would text her about how beautiful the moon was and how it reminded him of her, or come around to where he thought she might be and give her a little gift.  It turned out he was a family friend and that he had been crushing on her and waiting for her since she was 12.  Every now and then her family would talk about him with the implication that he and O used to be very close.  However, whenever I asked her about him, she would tell me he was annoying, she didn't like him, and that they had been friends but that was it and that there was never anything romantic between them.  

I ignored this guy the best I could, which wasn't hard since O obviously chose to date me.  We dated for nine months, and during this time I found out that O was not a virgin and had slept with her first boyfriend.  Both of us grew up in a conservative Christian environment, and this was hard news for me to take since I was a virgin and wasn't expecting this from O, since she had been giving off the impression that she was a very scrupulous, Christian girl who even told me she wasn't like other girls.  I mean, O was the kind of girl who would go to Bible studies, work at Bible camps, etc., and at the time this was the kind of girl I was looking for (this is no way is me judging anyone who chooses to have sex before marriage; I am simply trying to provide context).  It was hard for me to deal with this, partly because O still kept things from this guy: a fancy wooden chest he crafted for her, love poems, pictures, etc.  O said she was sorry and that it was a mistake but never acted apologetic or remorseful, and I explained to her that I was hurt and disappointed, partly because she held on to all these things as reminders while trying to convince me that she truly was sorry.  But, whatever, I forgave her and tried dealing with that on my own though I started having a hard time trusting her.  

We ended up having sex before marriage (yes, we were young and hypocrites).  The night we did it, she drove back to her house and got a box of condoms out of her closet.  Later I asked her why she had those condoms as it seemed weird to me that a girl who was trying to act like a good, holy Christian would have those.  She said they were given to her as a gag gift and she had forgotten she had them but had never used them.  That didn't make sense to me as she knew exactly where they were when she wanted them, but I put it out of my head since we were having sex. 

Nine months into our dating relationship, we chose to get engaged.  During this time, I was on O's e-mail for some reason and found e-mails she had saved from Cameron to herself.  In these e-mails were pictures of them heavily kissing on a beach in Taiwan.  I was surprised and asked O, my fiancee, about these.  She basically shrugged them off and explained that she had wanted to travel the summer before me.  Since her family knew Cameron was in Taiwan teaching--and since they knew he was a good family friend--they thought it'd be a good and safe excuse for her to visit Taiwan.  So she explained that the kissing meant nothing, that it was just for fun.  I also saw a picture that was quite suggestive with her smiling at the camera while lounging on a chair in her bathrobe (he was behind the camera).  She said she didn't have sex with him, and I chose to believe her even though I knew that most young people in that situation would have had sex due to hormones, being in a foreign environment, or just for the fun of it.  I'm sure I probably would have.

Well, we got married and Cameron showed up at our wedding.  I was annoyed by this, but O claimed he wasn't invited.  Whatever.  I ignored it and moved on.

About a year into our marriage, I was going through some boxes of my wife's things in our storage room and found an old diary.  I shouldn't have opened it, but I did.  Inside I read an entry written when she was much younger about how she wanted to spend so much time with Cameron and was angry how her grandfather wouldn't let her.  This made me wonder because she had always told me she never had any romantic feelings towards him and that he was annoying.  I asked her about what she had written, but she said she didn't remember any of it.

Through the next year or two we had our ups and downs.  I quickly realized that my wife wasn't empathetic at all and had a very hard time apologizing or showing remorse for things.  I also realized that she had a habit of running away from her problems instead of communicating with me about them.  

About two years into our marriage, we ended up moving to Taiwan so I could teach in Taipei (I had also traveled there while in college, and so we thought it'd be a fun place to live for a bit).  We were there for two years and had a blast.  However, during the second year, I discovered that Cameron (who was no longer living in Taiwan) had messaged my wife on Myspace and told her how beautiful she was.  She replied, but the conversation was disrupted by my finding it.  She said she was sorry and deleted her Myspace account, and I told Cameron that he was out of line telling my wife such things.  Some people may think I overreacted, but I was tired of this guy continuously popping up, it seemed, in one form or another and finally had enough.

So, that was that, or so I thought.

We moved back to the U.S. after two years in Taiwan.  Our marriage was suffering at this point.  I had a bad temper, my wife was very unempathetic and unemotional about many things.  I would try to talk with her, only to be ignored.  Our sex life was also sucky, and even though I tried working on it with her, we weren't really getting anywhere.  I also had a hard time trusting her.  I started flirting with other women and felt justified because my wife was ignoring me.  I met one young lady--had an emotional affair--and my wife found out.  That lasted for a while, and then I had another emotional affair with another young lady and also flirted with my wife's best friend (at her friend's pushing and prodding).  I felt terrible for these things and often tried stopping and focusing on my wife.  However, every time I would stop and focus on my wife, I would still be sexually and emotionally ignored and so would slip back into my conversations with other women.  I never had sex with them, though, and I am not talking or flirting with anyone now.  

About two years ago, my wife brought up the idea of divorce.  This was a wake-up call for me and I downloaded Homer MacDonald's book and made some good changes.  My wife came back, things went up and down, she threatened divorce again, and this became the new normal for a while.  During this time I found out that my wife had started talking to Cameron on the phone.  She had traveled down to Florida to visit her grandparents, would barely talk to me, but had talked to him quite a bit.  Also, on the night she kicked me out of our home, she had called him both before and after for emotional support.  I also found out that they had been sending each other birthday cards since we were married and that they had been talking off and on pretty much since our wedding.  I was very hurt by this since, even though I knew I had not been loyal to my wife in regards to the emotional affairs, that I had at least been loyal for the first four years of our wedding.  I was devastated to find out that my wife had never been loyal to me, it seemed.  

I later found out that she had been having extensive conversations with him on Facebook.  In these conversations, he would talk about how much he used to love her, how their relationship could have rivaled those in the Bible (he considers himself a conservative Christian, I would say).  He even talked about how he wished he had kept his promise to her when he left for Taiwan long ago before O and I dated.  Apparently she saw him before he left and made him promise he would come back to her after his six-month contract.  Instead, he stayed in Taiwan.  He apologized to her about that, but this was news to me.  After finding about these conversations, my wife denied knowing what he was talking about and said she didn't remember anything about a promise.  Then, knowing I had found their Facebook conversations, they took their talking to Words with Friends.  I found these conversations too, and all these conversations were full of words showing that there definitely was a romantic relationship between them and showed him encouraging her to leave me.  

So, I messaged this guy and told him we needed to talk.  He refused, said he didn't know what I was talking about and said I was overreacting.  I told him I had the evidence of their conversations, and for the second or third time in my life I told him to leave my wife alone and stop talking with her.

They were done, or so I thought.  

Last week I found out that they were e-mailing again.  This happened back in August of this year.  Cameron was going BACK to Taiwan, and before he left they went on a walk at a nature park near our house, with my two sons.  She also invited him to yoga with her.  Then, in a final e-mail, said she had always cherished their friendship and that he shouldn't try talking with her right now as she didn't want me to find out and get angry while she was working on the divorce.  This was two months ago, like I said, and since then our relationship had been going fairly well.  I was devastated to learn of these things last week, and I simply don't know what to do.  I find myself questioning every single trust issue that my wife explained away earlier.  I wonder if she had slept with more guys, if she slept with Cameron, was there a more realistic reason why she had those condoms (was she sleeping around while dating me), and have questions about a lot of other red flags that she explained away and I chose to believe her about (things I don't have time to mention here, but things that most guys would be like, Yeah, okay, that's not going to fly  See you.).  I know a lot of these things happened before I came on the scene, but I feel like I can't trust her about anything and simply don't know who she is anymore.  Is she the person I thought she was?  This is an important question, and it feels like she has constantly lied to me and deceived me about Cameron.  And, if she was willing to do this, what else has she lied about?  

I confronted her one night about what I had found, she started crying and asked if I wanted her to leave.  I said no but explained my trust issues, and that's basically been it from her.  No apologies, no remorse, nothing.  She is acting normal, like nothing has happened.  I had always been very clear about my distrust regarding Cameron and how I did not want the two of them talking.  She has known this since we were dating, and yet I'm faced with the knowledge that they have been talking and doing whatever from the beginning of my relationship with O and haven't really stopped.  

What do I do?  I'm tempted to post a message on Cameron's Facebook wall explaining to him how he has no right, especially as the Christian he considers himself to be, to keep talking to my wife after I have already told him to stop several times.  I would like to embarrass him in front of his employer, colleagues, and students, but at the same time that would embarrass my wife, too.  My wife would like to divorce me, but we have two young children who deserve better.  

I know I haven't treated my wife perfectly or even fairly for long periods of time, but to know that she and Cameron have apparently never really stopped their conversations, and that they started before I started not being loyal to my wife, is very upsetting.  Did she have sex with him?  I don't know, but now I wouldn't put it past her since she has had no problem lying to me and deceiving me.

I also forgot to mention that when she wanted to divorce me, she had lied to me about her whereabouts, money issues, etc.  

Please help!  Thank you.

23911,Infidelity,30uxxr,"Here's the deal. I've been with her for almost 10 years. We got married about 2.5 years ago. I love this woman with all my heart. We have an amazing 7 year old daughter together. 

I was a bastard to her for a long time. Going out all the time without her, getting drunk and being disrespectful. I caused a lot of pain to her. About a year ago I fucked up bad. I left my wife at the bar with her sister and I went home with my male and female friend. She thinks I cheated on her which I didn't. She also saw me flirting with a girl at a party. I didn't do anything but talk to her but she thinks otherwise. I cheated on her by making out with a friend a while ago. Coincidentally she did the exact same during the same month. We both admitted to it, worked on it and went to counseling and we seemed stronger for it.

Fast forward to about 18 months ago. I know I need to change. I start seeing a therapist. I stop drinking completely for about 6 months. My wife and my family and friends notice my change so its not just me patting myself on my back. I am treating her like I use to when we first started going out and I am really into the relationship again. We've had problems here and there. Our main one is that when we have misunderstandings, she will say something hurtful and I escalate and take it to a whole new level.

Fast forward to about 10 days ago(the friday before last). I was out with some co-workers(her and her sister join me later on). I lose her going from one place to another. She thinks I left her and I the same. We argue over texts and I go home. We say very hurtful things to each other over the phone. I go to sleep. I wake up around 5:30 am. She is not home yet. I call and call and her phone is off. Her sister who she was supposedely with does not answer. I look for them till 11:30 am saturday morning. They finally turn up safe and sound. I come to find out that she had in the night, danced with some random guy(she knows that a big no no with me) and they went home to a friend house. 

After prying over the last week I found out that it wasn't a friends house and that it was two random guys they met. Her sister spare me has slept with a lot of men and constantly goes home with random guys. How do I know? B/c my wife will stay up worried hoping she is ok when she gets texts from her. Not to mention my wife has admitted herself she bad mouths me a lot. 

Point in case: She went home with her sister to an after party where she crashed on the floor and the two guys and sister and other guy and girl all crashed also. 

I tell her I don't believe her and break up with her about 2 days ago. She tells me after the fact that in fact one of the guys at the apt went up to her and kissed her. She kissed him back for a bit and then pulled away b/c she said she couldn't. The guy apparently knew she was married and said I know.

I am willing to work past all of that. I don't want to give up on my marriage b/c of our toxic situation. I want to start over a clean slate b/c she is a great person. She made her choice to cheat on me but she didn't get their on her own. My question is that only after grilling her, more and more of this story keeps coming out. My concern is she did sleep with another guy and she is scared to tell me. When she told me she made out with another guy I lost my anger and threw my small tv through a window.

23912,Breakups,3eos1g,"First, some background information. We are both in high school, I am a junior and she's a sophomore. We're both pretty smart and I'm a bit of a nerd. We both do theater at our high school but hadn't known each other long before our relationship. I asked her out on Valentine's Day, and broke up with her just a few days ago.

Pretty much throughout our entire relationship, I felt like I never really emotionally (or physically) connected with her, because whenever I tried to talk to her about something serious (like our feelings for each other, kissing, etc.) she would reply with I don't know to my questions, and seem to appear slightly irritated at me asking it, although she didn't remain angry at me at all. She told me that she has an in ability to talk about her feelings to others, including her own family, and she gets stressed and shuts down whenever she attempts to. I really am attracted to her and honestly besides this, she doesn't have a lot of flaws. She's polite, kind, works hard in school, and cares about her future. However, last week I basically told her that i couldn't take the lack of connection anymore and said that we should part ways for now. Obviously I miss her, but I really didn't see any other option. Does she have some sort of actual disorder, or is it just a part of being a teenager? Should I wait and see if she matures to where she's comfortable talking about stuff and then try a relationship with her again? I really just want another opinion in this because I feel hopeless.

23915,Breakups,35vxz9,"I've [24F] been friends with M [25F] for almost 11 years - we went to high school together in our hometown. I moved to the big city for college and she moved there a few years after for an internship, so I've been here for about 7 years and her about 2-3.

M has always had depressive moments, and has been on antidepressants which have made her pretty spaced out and apathetic for years, but in the past 2 years especially it really has seemed like she's been stunted. It's hard to explain, but where my other friends and I have all grown up through college and post-college -- when it comes to dating, relationships, jobs, finding your own apartment, making friends, etc -- it seems like M just... hasn't grown.

So, without wanting to sound like I'm just going to list a bunch of negative things about her, here are some of the things that have gone haywire in our relationship during the past 2 years.

1). She's been extremely depressed and isolated in the big city, and has no friends here. She avoids going out and dating people and is still a virgin but she's always complaining to me about how she's still a virgin. I have several social circles, a boyfriend, and a group of really fun coworkers, so I've done my best to invite her out anytime I'm out, though she rarely drinks, parties, talks, or reaches out to people on her own. my boyfriend and I have tried to introduce her to about 5 guys now. Each one takes an interest until they talk to her more, then become completely disinterested due to her awkwardness and lack of social cues and desperation

2). She has hit on both boyfriends I've had that I have introduced her to. My current boyfriend is pretty emotionally aware/mature, so he noticed her awkwardly flirting with him and craving his male attention when all 3 of us hung out the first time. Her behavior made me and him both extremely uncomfortable (she was only making eye contact with him, ignoring me, getting into her sultry mode, etc) and he said when i was in the bathroom, she leaned closer to him and just got weird. I know I'm not crazy, because he backed me up on this one and did everything he could to avoid her advances. So this entire thing has broken my trust in her. It's like she has no concept of the 'girl code' whenever guys are around.

3). She relies on me for everything, but never thanks me or tries to do anything on her own. She depends on me completely for social events, friends, introducing her to men. She also lived in a boarding house that she hated, and was isolated in, so I let her take a room in my apartment for a sublet to jumpstart her apartment search (she wanted to move to my neighborhood only because I moved there but never did any of her own apartment hunting). My boyfriend and I moved her (he did most of the work by borrowing his friend's car and carrying things) and she never really thanked us. We had to ask her to buy us pizza. My bf has also bought her tickets to shows and she's never thanked him. 

4). It often feels like she's trying to be me even though she's resentful towards me, which gets incredibly annoying. She tries to fit in with my friends, hit on my bf, steal my roommates, move into my neighborhood, etc but she never asks me how I'm doing. She only complains about things, sits in a corner by herself and sulks at me.


5). The problem is that we've been friends for so long, and I worry about her mental health/depression and potentially being suicidal. She's like a burden that I have to carry around though I get nothing out of our friendship. She has no one else here but me, plus a lot of my hometown friends are still friends with her so it would be awkward for me to breakup with her. I've tried to detach myself from her, and I also told her recently I'd be moving out of the apartment (because I can no longer deal with her or deal with her burdening me). But it seems like I can't avoid her in all social situations.

Long story short, she planned on staying longer in the apartment than I expected. I only tried to help her, and I thought she'd find her own place, but she made it clear she has no intention to go out on her own and she said she'll do whatever I do. I can't take it anymore!

I was never able to get to that point.  I just didn't love her, for whatever reason (and we talked about this multiple times).  But I really cared about her, had fun being with her (most of the time), and we had GREAT sex.  I was always totally honest with her about my feelings and where I was at.  We both just kept dating each other.  But then it got to a point where she kept wanting more and I kept wanting less.

I started seeing a new girl [also 27F] and we dated for about a month.  But the same thing happened.  She is at the point in her life (masters degree, good job, no debt, dog, etc) that she is looking for a husband.  She started making future plans (I am going to my best friend's wedding this summer and she invited herself along, she wanted to plan a summer getaway, etc).  She seemed really ready to be exclusive and go all in.  We talked about it and mutually decided to break it off due to this imbalance.

I am 26, living in my parents basement, and about to change careers/potentially be unemployed.  Also, looking for jobs in other states...  So I am just not looking for anything super serious.  I am fine being exclusive.  I work two jobs so I don't really have the time to be dating multiple girls, anyways.  However, I am definitely not looking for a wife or a big time commitment.  I want to be clear: I would be fine with a girl I am dating going on dates with other dudes.  She doesn't have to wait around for my busy ass.  Honestly, I would prefer that.  I hate knowing a girl is on my beck and call, which both of these girls were.  If I wanted to meet up, they were free...

Background:

I met my girlfriend (now my wife) in 1985 We started our relationship by the end of the year. We married in 1996 and we have 2 sons: 15 and 14 years old. That means we have been together for 30 years. Like any marriage, with lots of ups and downs.

My then girlfriend had an affair in 1990 with a friend of her. That caused a break on our relationship and I decided to forgive her because she told me that the cheating consisted only of multiple kisses and caresses.
Last month (May 2015) she confessed to me that she and her friend had sex tree times, back in 1990. She also said to me that she didn't told me the whole truth because of her fear of me dumping her.

I feel shattered. I trusted her words and I married her and raised a family.

Now I feel my marriage has been a lie. I feel my marriage is based on a lie. I feel she has confessed now because we have a family and children and would be very difficult for me to leave them.

I would like to get away from her, not for sleeping (fucking) this guy, but for having lied to me for 25 years.
Another part of me wants to forgive her and let go because it was so long ago and it doesn't matter anymore.

What do you think about this my dear internet friends? Should I walk away or forgot (leave behind) whatever happened 25 years ago?

23924,Breakups,3ed594,"I have been with my boyfriend for about 2 years now. I won't go into too much background detail for the sake of anonymity, but in summary, we met on a popular video game about two years ago and found that we lived in the same city, so we immediately met up upon realizing and had an instant connection.

We moved in together in February. I made it very clear beforehand that I needed the apartment to be kept clean (this was a big deal for a few reasons: his apartment beforehand was disgustingly dirty and I mean to the point of being rather hazardous to one's health, I have OCD and while messy spaces are not extreme triggers for me they make me extremely nervous and anxious, especially anything with organic material). He would roll his eyes and agree like I was nagging him and it was obvious that it would be so. It was not so. I was out of town for a week for a family trip and when I returned the place was absolutely disgusting. It took weeks to get all the flies out and I had to scrub the place. He didn't clean out the cat litter ONCE the entire week(!!) and claims that he didn't notice that it was dirty, as if it takes an expert to know that cats shit daily.

He also still plays a LOT of the video game that we met on. I don't play it so much anymore in lieu of trying to be productive in other ways. I would usually be okay with this, as a gamer myself, but his habits are detrimental to my well being. He will get grumpy when I don't want to play the game and act like I'm snubbing him if I ask if he wants to do literally anything else. He's always too lazy to go on a walk with me, let alone actually go anywhere. I ask him what he would like to do and he always says the video game, nothing else. It's agony. I am recovering from a long bout of a stagnant lifestyle stemming from somewhat severe manic depression. Only recently have I started doing things I like again instead of just staying couchlocked smoking weed and playing video games. Let it be known that even atop all this I still play 3 or 4 hours a day, at minimum, of the video game with him. It's not like we never play the game. And before our sex life gets brought up, he gets it multiple times a day. I get off. His hygiene is poor but he's not bad in bed.

He is not just content to maintain the toxic environment (by making less than no effort around the house or in our relationship; the few conversations we have are always commanded by him and I cannot say a sentence without being steamrolled, and he consistently believes that I am stupid when I am in actuality very educated and not a complete idiot), he punishes me for daring to deviate. This morning was the last straw when he, upon me greeting him when he woke up, told me essentially that he didn't like that I didn't play the video game during the day anymore and said that it contributed to his sleep problems as it made him play later at night (aka he stays up until 3 am playing the game, after I have gone to sleep at 11 pm, when he has work at 5 and gets upset with me as if I'm attacking him when I mention that that must not be good for his health and I'm worried about him).

I am just so tired. I'm 18 and I'm finally starting to break out of a really bad place. I love my boyfriend but I feel like we are not good for each other. I must control everything that happens or it never gets done. If I don't buy groceries we will have no groceries for weeks. If I don't clean the house nothing will be cleaned, including food, used condoms, even disgusting messes he is aware of and intentionally ignores for weeks or even months. I want to live life and meet interesting people who don't roll their eyes when I say anything and get hyperdefensive if I don't say anything that isn't I agree with you!. I don't need convincing that we aren't right for each other. I'm just worried for a ton of reasons.

* I love him, he's my first boyfriend, despite this post there are two years of wonderful memories and he has a goofy, caring personality; I would be shattered

* He would be shattered; without me he would essentially have no furniture, apartment, cat, or friends (neither of us really have friends outside of each other, I know it's unhealthy)

* 1-year lease...

* He would likely fight about keeping the cat despite me being the one who paid for her, her medical bills, and being the sole caretaker of her in terms of food, water, and even cleaning up the litter

23925,Dating,3f4y2o,"I started dating this guy recently (I'll call him Sam), and he is the only guy I've ever felt romantically about. We met through mutual friends, it started out with me just being a good friend and offering him a place to stay when he had to get out of the house and someone to talk to when he was in trouble, but it soon became apparent we had feelings for each other. We've only been together for a week, but the week has been filled with cuddling and messaging and I really like him, but I just don't know whether I can do this and I know I can't leave him.

When we started talking, he told me that he is awkward because he was bullied all through school for being gay, and has never really been close with others. He then confessed that he had had suicidal thoughts recently because his parents aren't the most supportive of him, and he hasn't had anyone to be there for him. I went through MANY years of depression, and I never want anyone to feel that way, so I tried my hardest to make sure that he felt wanted, but I'm not going to lie, he made it really hard because of the anxiety, insecurity, and paranoia (kept saying he thought he was annoying me, even though I kept reassuring him).

I would honestly be willing to work through all of this: I've never felt romantically about a guy, but I'd make it work; I've been trying to help him out of his depression; I have been trying to get his self confidence; I've been trying to make him feel loved, but when we were hanging out with some friends tonight he was really distant, leading me to send him this afterward, Hey Sam, I know you are driving and have work in the morning, so I understand of you don't respond right away, but I need to know what's going between us. With the cuddling and messaging I though maybe we were a thing, but then tonight you barely talked to me, and I'm pretty sure Branden (a hetero friend of ours) got more action from you than I did. I really like you Sam, but you aren't acting like you like me, and I get it if it is because you are insecure or something, I just need to know what's going on.

He responded with this, I don't know... I really don't... I like you but I have so much going on and I'm confused and every time I like anybody this shit happens and I can't take it and I just want to... Idk...

I told him, Sorry man. Well if you need some time to figure things out, I don't blame you, but like I always tell you, I'm here for you if you need me, but I am honestly really hurt right now. I put so much into every day, even before we started dating, because I cared about him, and I didn't want anything to happen, but now he's in the span of one day going from spending the night and calling me hun, to IDK.

 I would have left the already, but I can't do it him knowing how much he hurts. He is depressed, anxious, insecure, and even having suicidal thoughts occasionallly, and I'm just not sure I can keep up being his personal therapist, cheerleader, and boyfriend, especially if he can just flip how he feels in a day.

I know that, you have to put your needs first, and, you shouldn't let them pull you down with you, but I can't do this to him. I want to be with him, and I'm afraid of what he'd do if I left, but I don't know if I can keep up such an exhausting relationship if doesn't even know how he feels about me.

I was finally happy again and thought I found hope.

Then out of the blue he said we need to slow things down, it feels like this is a relationship and that scares me. Of course this hurt, since I'm already so heartbroken from the death of my boyfriend and this cut like a knife. He also says he feels like second best next to my passed bf.

The next day I was very emotional, I had so much stress going on in my life, and our relationship stress on top of that. He says he still likes me, but was kind of taken back by my behavior. I apologized and reassured him he did nothing wrong, it was just a moment of weakness on my part.

We last spoke a few days ago, and he asked if we could just not speak for a few days so he can figure everything out. I told him if he knew at that moment he didn't want to see me anymore to just tell me, it's better than waiting around. He told me I don't know what I want.

I haven't contacted him, nor am I planning to. I'm also friends with him on a bunch of social media, twitter, instagram, Facebook, and I think he may have met someone else.

23935,Infidelity,2vg0le,"My fiance and I were together in the same city for 7 years. We had the normal ups and downs. For the last three years, we've had to do a long distance thing. For the first 7 years, I made a lot of career sacrifices to accommodate his. Mine was finally taking off just as he got a transfer to California. We've been rocky during those long distance years. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think maybe the physical distance between us was creating issues. I knew nothing about his life. I hardly knew half the people he was friends with. Finally, we decided the long distance thing wasn't working and that I needed to be nearby to make this relationship work. Initially, the plan was for me to quit my job and move in with him. But a job opening within my company became available. It was near but prohibitive to live together. Either way, it was perfect. I was initially hesitant about the job. It was far from people, places and things. I also didn't like the role.  But he convinced me it was the right choice for our relationship. I bought a house and I moved.

&amp;nbsp;

We spent three or four weekends together in the first two months. I had to travel back to Seattle to transition out of my old job. Then suddenly, at the end of October, he tells me that hes unhappy and he wants to break up. I think he is going through something so I basically call and text him weekly to figure out what is going on. He starts painting our memories in a negative light, even though they weren't. He starts talking about how the distance caused him to emotionally distance himself from me when all of his actions suggested otherwise. (He proposed before I moved for god's sake). In November and December, I relentlessly call and email him trying to figure out what the hell is going on. Why was he doing this? What happened? Can we work this out by talking through it?

&amp;nbsp;

At this point, I can't sleep, I can't eat. The holidays go by. In January, I decide to stop by. I knocked, no one answered. The door was unlocked (he regularly leaves it unlocked when hes home). I went in. I discovered he was with someone else - the evidence strewn about his apartment. And their relationship started a couple days before he called it off with me. I learned he had met her parents. I learned his parents knew about her. I learned he was taking her to the same place he had taken me for valentines day the year before (where he proposed). They were reliving our memories together. They had basically threw themselves into a serious relationship in less than 3 months. 

&amp;nbsp;

I confronted him. Asked him why he asked me to put all of it on the line for him if he wasn't sure. Why I had left my friends, my family, my job to be with him. Why I had sunk all of my savings on a house. Why I was stuck in a city I never wanted to live in for 2 years because I signed a job contract because my company moved me. Where were the signs? Every time we saw eachother, it was bliss.

&amp;nbsp;

He got offended with me for invading his space. When I asked him to go to therapy with me (not to get back together, but to move forward in a healthy way), he said no. When I asked him to help me pay back my relocation expenses so I can get out of my contract and move back home (he can afford it easily), he said no. I put everything on the line and moved across country for a man who left me in less than 2 months of me arriving. I hadn't unpacked the last box.

I regularly have this nightmare of them having sex on his living room floor. I'm pounding on the window asking him to stop. He looks at me and keeps going. I pound and pound until my hands are bloody. And then I wake up with such adrenaline that my entire body tingles. I haven't slept since October. Not more than 3 hours a day. I've lost nearly 10 lbs. This wouldn't be so hard if I weren't so blindsided. This wouldn't be so hard if he shared in the consequences. This would be less scarring if he had made time for himself after our breakup before he jumped into someone else's bed.

He feels completely justified. His new girlfriend knows all of this and still wants him. And I'm stuck here for 2 years with no friends or family because I can't pay back my relocation. And the worst part is that I found a pros/cons list she wrote about him to help her decide if she wants to be dating a cheating asshole. The pros haunt me. She wrote, He drives me crazy. And that sentence literally haunts me. She wrote, he never gives up/gives in referring to me trying to get him back (before I knew about her).

23936,Breakups,20cl72,"Hi Reddit, very much looking for advice. 

Background Info: Met in college 2 years ago, started going out around January of last year. Last 4-5 months have been severely strained. 

2 weeks ago my girlfriend of the last year and a bit broke up with me. We had been going through a very strained patch throughout the last 5 months and she finally decided enough is enough. She's an amazing person, funny, smart, beautiful, everything anybody could ever want. Of course there's little annoyances (very stubborn, very keen one early marriage)

I had a job for the summer which ended in september and after two months of getting absolutely nowhere in searching for a new job I completely lost all confidence in myself, I wasn't as social, I wasn't as comfortable when meeting new people, I was even avoiding contact with people and staying at home more and more often. I wasn't leaving my shell. I was completely depressed over the whole of christmas and into the new year. 

This put a massive strain on our relationship.
Needless to say, I wasn't me, I was tired, lazy, sluggish, inactive, bored and extremely apathetic. She lives about an hour away by public transport (train and then bus), while I lived at home with my parents and sisters.  I didn't show her the love and attention she deserved, I didn't do anything bad, I just didn't do anything good. 

Finally, two weeks ago she broke up with me by text after I couldn't come and visit her (I was going to, but neither of my parents came home before the last train leaves and I couldn't leave my sisters alone), she had been saying for most of february that 'she couldn't do this anymore' so this wasn't exactly a surprise. 

Here's where it gets tricky. She broke up with me 3 days before I started working at where she works (A big customer support call centre). The break up made me realise what a shocking human being I am and have been for the last 6 months. I realised that I'm not currently able for a relationship and finally sought out some councelling. I have been in a bit of a daze the last two weeks, especially since starting the new work. 

She wants me to fight for her. She feels that if she is 'worth it' that I would be fighting for her and putting all my efforts into doing so. I know that if I fought to win her back it would put us straight back into the same position we have been in for the last 6 months and that it would just make her more unhappy. I have too many issues (Weight, confidence, mentality) at the moment that I'm trying to sort out for me to be able to justify piling them on top of her again. 

I think I want space and time to better myself as a person and take some time to myself. 


I know this is probably horribly worded, badly phrased and full of missing details, please ask me if there's anything you're not understanding, I'm having a really difficult time wording it at this moment. Thanks for all your help in advance!

23939,Breakups,1ga1q4,"I've been dating my GF for a year and a half. I broke up with her after a year for a total of 2 months. To briefly summarize, I broke up with her because she lied a lot about doing hard drugs while drinking with friends. It's not about the drugs (necessarily), it was about honesty and about continually breaking a promise without telling me. In every instance, I was the one who had to find out. It was only then she would admit to it.

After we broke up, I focused on myself and she started seeing a counselor. We got back together after I asked her to take a drug test (she passed). She stopped drinking entirely which was the catalyst for the drug use and I'm almost 100% certain that she hasn't been secretly going out and drinking. I'm extremely proud of how well she's done. I know it's hard since I've got an addictive personality too.

One of the problems before we broke up was her friend and coworker. He's gay (if anyone cares). The problem is that he does a lot of drugs and was the guy she'd go partying with. They have been good friends for a long time before we started dating. When we got back together I told her that if I ever found out she was secretly hanging out with him, I could only assume it was for one reason. Especially given her history. 

She has said to me that she doesn't really talk to him anymore and does not ever hang out with him. I've no reason to believe otherwise, yet I sometimes wonder if that's really true. I ask from time to time how he's doing and she'll say she's not sure because they don't really talk much. There have been two times where he's asked for a ride and she has let me know she was going to give him one. I appreciated it and never questioned her on it.

Here's the issue though. I just heard about an appreciation day in the town where we live where business give out gift cards, bags, coupons, etc and I told my gf that I couldn't believe we somehow missed it. She said that she went with her friend and another coworker. They took a break from work and walked around for a bit. 

I was pretty surprised because from all accounts, she says she's not really friends with him anymore, doesn't know what he's up to, etc. Yet, they still do stuff together. I don't feel like she's being honest about her relationship with him and honestly, I think the other coworker being there was probably just to make me feel better about it.

I KNOW they aren't skipping out to drink and do drugs. I've no reason to believe that. Yet, I feel like she should have mentioned it. Lastly, given her history, I can't help but wonder about other times she might have done stuff that she simply didn't tell me about. I thought I was very clear. It's not that I don't want her to have her friendship, it's just that I want her to be honest with me about where her friend stands in her life and more importantly, where I stand.


**tl;dr**: I broke up with my ex-gf because she was partying and denying it. I got back with my ex-girlfriend because she went to counseling and stopped partying. When we got back together I told her that if I found out she was hanging out with her best-party-friend (and coworker) and not telling me, it would be a big deal. 
I recently found out she took a break from work to go to an event in our town with her party friend. I don't think she's partying, but it really bothers me that she didn't even mention it.
I can't tell how big of a deal this is and I don't know what to do about it. Help?

23941,Breakups,25ib6d,"This was my first time trying to date a guy after coming out as gay. I don't know if I'm the asshole, or we just don't work out for each other.

I met him at a bar, he was attractive, we got along great, go to the same university, nice guy. I could see myself being with him.

He just expected me to replace too much of my life that I value for him, and at least to me, I didn't feel like I should.

I don't know if I'm selfish or not. Do I need to give up my other relationships in order to date someone?

I'm best friends with my ex-gf. I dated her for a couple years. I've known her since grade school. She knows me better than anyone alive today. I love her, I just do not attract to her sexually.

I have another best friend, he's a straight guy, and I've known him for 5 years. He's like my brother, I tell him everything, we hang out all the time.

Those two are the main people in my life when I'm not dating someone. I text them off and on throughout the day, everyday. I hang out with them a few times a week. Sometimes alone, they are very good friends too, so sometimes the three of us go out.

I have 3 other guys I know really well, I just don't see them as much. And by as much, I see them once or twice a week. We text sometimes too.

He just had a problem accepting that I wasn't going to let these people drift away when I got to know him.

I still had time to text him every day, I still had time for me to WANT to see him 4 or 5 days in a week. I wanted to make it work, but at the same time I wasn't going to give up my friends.

I didn't have to change any of this while dating my ex-gf, she was happy I had great friends, and she often came along with us, she became friends with all my friends so it always worked.

I was more than willing to do the same with him, he just seemed to want it to just be us all the time.

I would still tell my ex and my best friend every detail of my life, I would also do the same to him, but it takes time to build that relationship, but I was more than willing to allow it to happen.

I love all these other people, they mean the world to me. There is more than enough room I think to have a boyfriend in my life without sacrificing anything else.

I agree, maybe I do hang out and have too close relationships with people I'm not dating. Should I be guilty for this?

I do find my male best friend attractive, he is, if he was gay I would marry him. He isn't. We are still amazing friends, and I tell him everything, we hang out all the time. I don't know if this is wrong or not?

I spent every Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night (one of those days) playing video games, drinking, and ordering take out with these guys I know plus my best friend. I've done this for a year. We sleep over and have an amazing time.

I offered for him to come with us, but he didn't want to, but always seemed upset I couldn't spend the night with him.

He seemed upset that I wasn't upset that he was upset. If that makes sense.

I don't know if I need to open my eyes. Is this my fault? I was more than willing to incorporate him into my life, but I'm not giving up people I love. Is this OK?

I knew he was calling and texting her, and I was okay with it at first, but that’s because 

1. I didn’t know he was sexting her (obviously)
2. I didn’t know she was THE girl that had previously broke his heart and he still pined for somewhat.

Then, today, I was just browsin’ the Face, when I stumbled upon his “likes.” I wasn’t snooping, however I was “Facebook stalking” a little, but not with intention of catching him doing anything. I just like staring at people’s lives… 

I don’t know what to think.

I tell him EVERYTHING. What’s more, he expects me to! But he keeps so much from me. It's not just this girl he still talks with. There are plenty of girls that he used to chase and he still texts them and talks with them via Facebook. It wouldn't bother me so much if he just told me! Girls text him as well and BLATANTLY flirt (he doesn't tell me). He says he doesn't notice... I used to believe that but now I don't know. After what happened, now that he’s liking this woman’s pictures still, I'm very confused. 

Am I overreacting? I don’t have many friends that I can talk to about this and I don’t want to overreact. I know it’s just Facebook but it really hurts that he even has little bit of contact with her. I don’t want to read to much in to the other girls, either. I don't even know how to broach the subject.

I am and 18 year old male, and I met this lovely, funny and beautiful girl over a year ago, I was instantly attracted to her, I know the word love is strong and overused, so I won't say I loved her, but I was really attracted to her and seeked a relationship with her, we spoke for a bit and got quite close, but then found out she had a partner, this was off-putting to me, as I liked her so much, I wanted to hang in there, just in case they broke up, because I was brainwashed, because I really liked her; but in the end, we both talked about it and discussed It wasn't fair for either us, me or her partner, so we just drifted apart. 

Come 6 months later, I get myself a girlfriend and stay in the relationship for just over a year, my relationship was pretty bad with my girlfriend, I will not go into detail, but I ended it and we have not contacted each other since. When me and my girlfriend broke up, my old crush contacts me and says she has just broken up with her boyfriend about a month before I broke up with my girlfriend, so after a period of getting over our relationships, we both discuss the past and my feelings. She said liked me when she was in her relationship, and that is why she ended it, in hopes that I'd split up with my girlfriend eventually and nobody had made her feel as special as I did (When we first spoke).

Then comes this reveal from her, she asks me if I had sex with my partner, and she gets jealous, and says that it upset her, al though it is my fault, the reasoning for this is that she wanted to be my first, It seems like she liked me even when she had a boyfriend, that I treat her so well even as friends, that I understand her better than most people, and I really do like this girl too, I really care for her - and If I didn't have my doubts, I'd be with her in a heartbeat, but this is what puts me off.

In about 3 years, she has 4 boyfriends, ofcourse this was during high school, so many weren't that serious, but the fact that she's had 4 boyfriends in 3 years puts me off, considering I have only had one, that lasted for over a year, and as well as that - If she liked me and was attracted to me when she was in a relationship, what will stop her this time? What will stop her from ending it with me to seek someone else; the only explanation I have is that because she told me I have always been special to her, she has always wanted to be with me the most, I have always treated her the best, and she has always wanted to be with me, but I had a girlfriend, and before I did, she had a boyfriend. 

I know she would not cheat on me, kiss someone/have sex and such, especially telling me how she felt about me, how I'm the only one that understands her and such, It seems like I would be the best boyfriend for her, she's not a mean girl, she's lovely, caring and emotional, I have known all of her ex boyfriends, and they have been pretty nobby If I have to be honest, I would love to be in a relationship with her, but what would stop her from leaving me for someone else? Liking someone else? Just as she liked me, Or if she liked me that much, maybe we should try and give it a go?

So pretty much after a 2 year relationship where we were best friends and lovers (did everything together, didn't lie to each other, considered perfect by my standards) he started feeling guilty about being with me because I was more in love with him than he was with me.

He said he felt trapped by me, so he broke it off and has pretty much been all over the place dating since then. He often used to complain about me getting to explore and how he never has before.

We've currently broken contact, but he purposely goes to places at Uni where he knows I'll be (where my friends hangout, since he kind of knows them).

Anyways, I have a few major questions.

1. I'm still deeply in love with him, should I just keep avoiding him forever?

2. A lot of people are telling me that it's a phase he'll get over when he is done exploring (which could take who knows how long, but he's decently awkward with new people so he may not do anything for a while).

3. Right now I'm planning on keeping contact broken until a big halloween party by our mutual friends (this halloween would have been a second anniversary). I just feel like I can maybe try to talk to him about what he wants in life.

Lately I've been getting really annoyed with him, and some of the problems in our relationship are really starting to bug me... such as: 


- I've never been to his house the entire time we've been dating because he's living with his parents 'temporarily'. He lived on his own until about 6 months before we met, he owns his own house. He doesn't want me to meet his parents yet, therefore I can't go over. I also haven't met any of his friends or family at all. His family is of a culture where you 'supposedly' don't bring a girl to meet them unless you're planning on announcing an engagement.


- I feel like it's always about sex. He gets annoyed with me/keeps pestering me for it when I say no. 


- His ex: I feel like I'll never compare to her. He was so in love with his ex and they were engaged, however she cheated on him and broke off the engagement; he was heartbroken. He still mentions her from time to time. I've talked to him about this and he says he's over her but I feel like he isn't.


- He's slept over at my place three times since we've been together. Apparently he likes to sleep alone, and is easily disturbed during the night and can't get a good sleep in the same bed as me.


I have spoken to him about all of these issues, and nothing has been resolved for me.
I'm starting to feel like this is the end of the line for us. He's been talking about marriage, kids, etc. and says he sees a future with me and is constantly asking me questions about our future, where I want to live, kids, and he's even been hinting at a proposal. He asked me to show him what kind of rings I like. 
On the other hand, I don't think I could ever marry him. I feel we have too many issues in our relationship that won't ever be resolved. Other than that, I try to see past the issues and when we're together we have fun. I care about him very much. If I break up with him though, he will be very blind sided.

P.S. I know he's not married or cheating on me-- I sort of had a friend stalk his house a few times and he really does live with his parents.

I'm being a little eager by not just waiting til the weekend, but we won't be able to hang out this weekend so we have to work around our schedules. 



Is it a bad move to already start spending the night with a guy? What are y'all's opinions on what're appropriate boundaries for a very new relationship?

23974,Breakups,2z8ebe,"About five months ago, I broke up with a girlfriend of about one year. The relationship was really bad for me, but I was a doormat for most of it so it was really my fault. I let her treat me really badly. However, eventually, I grew a backbone and ended things. About three months ago, I started dating this awesome new girl that I've honestly fallen really hard for. She's really fantastic, and I've used mistakes from my last relationship to lay the foundations of a great one now. 

However, occasionally, I'll see a picture pop up of my ex on a friends Facebook or I'll see her with her new boyfriend as well. I'm not jealous of the boyfriend, because it's a pretty big downgrade (I know it sounds arrogant, but I know her taste in men and it's definitely a downgrade in both personality and looks) and plus, I legitimately hope that she is happy. I don't hate her or anything anymore. However, sometimes I'll feel a stab of hurt seep into my chest. Is this normal? Despite how badly I was treated for a lot of the relationship, I'm not going to pretend it was 100% awful and abusive. There were good moments, and while dating her I would have said I was in love.

Is this normal? Even while being in another loving and healthy relationship? Do these feelings eventually fade or go away completely? I just sometimes feel bad that I'm apparently not 100% over it (otherwise, why would I get these tinges of hurt?) while being in a new relationship that really means a lot to me.

23976,Dating,39hj3y,"Okay, first off I want to say that I'm legal where I live, and she's not an authority figure.

I'm a lesbian, and though I've had a few girlfriends, I'm a lonely virgin. I was messaged a couple of days ago by an older woman who's a BDSM domme. I'm a sub, and though she didn't know that, she asked me if I was interested in things like that. She knows how old I am.

Now, I've had a lot of crushes on older women before, so it's not that fact by itself that's a concern.

Anyway, I told her I'm a sub, and she seems really into me. We've pretty much only talked sex so far, but apparently, she wants a 24/7 BDSM relationship, which I'm nervous about, since I haven't tried any of these things IRL.

I feel so dirty because of this. I really just want sex and maybe validation as well, I'd probably prefer dating a girl my own age or just a bit older, and yet it's really hot that she's older. And I feel like I wouldn't get this chance again. I'm afraid my friends would judge me, and I don't even know the logistics, since I live with my parents in a different city than she does.

To be honest, if it was a friend my age telling me this, I'd probably tell them to run away. But I'd personally feel pathetic for refusing to meet up with this woman.  She's nice, too, and not pushy or anything. She just seems really attracted to me. Which feels good.

I have been working in an craft beer bar since October. I messed up my first year of university due to personal reasons so I'm retaking a few modules this year but as I'm not getting any student loan I had to take on a full-time job. Not the most ideal situation but I thought hey I'd make the best of it.


When I first started working there I met B and I thought he was cute, but as I was in a relationship at the time I didn't consider the possibility of us hooking up. The other guys joked that he was a bit of a heart breaker, but I thought they were just teasing him with a bit of bar banter. Immediately we bonded as we both came from the same home city, and as he had recently graduated I think we both recognised we were in a place we didn't particularly want to be.


However as my relationship started to deteriorate into what had been a long time coming break up, I had been in a long distance relationship for 1 1/2 years and we had gradually grown apart, I had to admit to myself that I was strongly attracted to him.


I hardly told anyone I worked with that I had broken up with my boyfriend, mainly as I'm quite private with my personal life and didn't feel like going round announcing it to everyone. I figured it would happen naturally and that was how I preferred it.


I knew B liked me as I had heard him talking about me to a regular telling him that he thought I was amazing but he knew I had a boyfriend so he wouldn't try anything on. I really wanted to tell him I was now single but I didn't know how to without it being kind of obvious/seeming a bit forward.


One night B offered to walk me home from a friends party round the corner and I accepted, only remembering when I got to my front door that I had lent my keys to my house mate earlier and was locked out. He offered to put me up at his, nothing happened as he insisted he would sleep on the floor and I take his bed, but I think that was the point we both became aware there was sexual tension.


He started messaging me asking if I wanted to meet up and do something and I agreed. I think we both wanted to escape how monotonous and tedious work had become and really needed to talk to someone else about it. We went out for a quiet drink and ended up going on a massive bar crawl and talking for hours. I got blind drunk, told him I was single and we inevitably made out and told each other we were attracted to each other.


I had my warning lights on from the get go, I knew work relationships could be a bad idea so I decided to proceed with caution and take things very slowly. I definitely didn't want to jump into bed with him. 


The other main worry was that he was leaving and moving back to our home city in May, but I was going to go back there too for the summer around the same time so I figured things could possibly carry on.


We would meet up to go for lunch and walks and to hang out and watch movies. I expected him to start trying it on with me but he was respectful and would only kiss me. I couldn't believe how sweet and lovely he was being, it all felt too good to be true.


I'm naturally quite cynical, so when he started sending me texts saying things like My only plan today is to spend time with you I couldn't really take it seriously. It just felt disgenuine, like he knew all the right things to say from lots of practice. But I wanted to believe him when he would sweetly tell me how much he liked spending time with me and that he thought I was beautiful. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt.


I started to have further doubts when I realised he lived with his ex girlfriend, he said they had studied together and he had decided to live with her and stay in our uni city on a whim for another year. I just couldn't help but feel massively awkward when I went round to his house and met her, and felt like it was almost disrespectful towards her. He didn't seem to think there was any issue with it though, which was a bit of a red flag.


He would work the day shift and I would usually take over the night shift, and sometimes he would stay and drink throughout my shift or go out and then come back and hang out with me as I closed the bar. On this occasion he did so, and got in a taxi with me and my manager to go home, when we got to my house he asked if he could stay at my house in front of my manager. I said yes unsure of what else to say and my manager just looked amused and went awww you guys.


He was blind drunk and just sort of kissed me and ripped my clothes off, I was pretty into though so I wasn't complaining. We didn't have full on sex but stuff happened. It was all very lovely and we stayed awake all night talking and we had a chat about the fact he was leaving. I told him I guessed we could have a nice couple of months together and see how it went and he said it was my call but that he'd like that. He left to go to work the next day and left his phone and clothes at my house so came round later to pick them up and we chilled for a bit.

After that he did a complete 180 and was really distant me. We worked together the following weekend and things felt awkward and unnatural. He looked almost nervous and reluctant to speak to me, and when I asked him if he wanted to go for a drink when we finished he made a lame excuse about feeling tired and went home. 


I texted him on the monday to ask if he wanted to do something this week, to which I received no reply. Then on tuesday, exactly one week and one day after he'd stayed over at my house, all the regulars were sat around talking about how he had a new girlfriend and was seeing someone. 


I just stood there like what the actual fuck. What an arsehole. I felt well and truly played. But I was also angry at myself as I knew I really should have seen it coming.
He had the decency to text me the next day and tell me himself, he said he wanted to still hang out with me but just as friends, and that he had met someone else. He told me he thought I was an amazing person and that he didn't want this to affect our friendship. 


Now I can't help but feel I misinterpreted his feelings, was he just seeing me because he wanted to sleep with me. I think I definitely had stronger feelings for him than he did for me, and that he saw this as a very casual thing. 


This has been a strange and difficult year for me. I think the thing I am most upset about is that I felt like we had become very close friends and shared all these weird and funny experiences together, like how we spent new years eve together just me, him and my manager and crashed my managers family friends house party. Now it feels like our friendship is ruined, and it's pretty unbearable working with him.


We have to work together for another two months until he leaves, I feel quite hurt to be honest. I feel like if I get angry or passive aggressive everyone will see me as the bitter jaded ex though. Its all just kinda fucked and I don't know how to deal with this situation. I know that I still like him and I wish I could just turn those feelings off. 


I know I shouldn't but I can't help but feel second best, like I came up short somehow. I know that he has been quite unhappy and depressed after graduating and I want the best for him, but I wish he didn't have to fuck around with my head. Don't I deserve to be happy too?


I asked if we could meet up to clear the air a bit and he was really keen to do so, we're both on our holiday visiting family so we said we'd do it when we get back. I don't know what to say though. Should I be honest and tell him I'm hurt? Or should I laugh it off and joke about for the sake of making working together a bit easier?

Later that night she got drunk and called her boyfriend on the phone while i was there and teased him with me seeing her naked. He became quite upset over this and I got the impression that this relationship wasn't closed at all.

I managed to still hang out wtih her after that and things were fine as friends. That is, until a few days ago.

I have been away from home for a while so when i returned home she invited me to a party. We were all having fun and two gay guys started to make sexual jokes. Then it escalated to a bit more than a joke and then they decided they were actually going to do things in the bedroom. This seemed to do something for my friend and she invited me to do things with her while the two gay guys did stuff. I knew it was cheating when she offered but I had a bit of wine and so I wasn't thinking clearly plus my attraction to her blinded me.

23981,Dating,32vkfh,"Hi,

There isn't too much of a background needed here. Met, and was automatically interested in Mr. 26. He was funny, intelligent, cultural, gifted, we loved all of the same things, and I was incredibly mentally and physically attracted to him.

We spoke all day every day, we went on dates, but we didn't rush what we thought 'we' were going to be. We just took it slow, and had fun. 

However, when it came to us finally sleeping together, things got a bit strange. We spoke the next day, and I apologised, being self-conscious and fearful that maybe he hadn't wanted to sleep with me (I had the first move). He apologised back, and said he was just painfully awkward with women, and that he 100% wanted it, and was interested in me. 

Slowly, after that, our conversation started to drop of. At the time, I didn't want to annoy him, as we were both on holidays, and I was going to be going overseas to see my family. It got to the point where we were barely speaking anymore, and I, being self-conscious, assumed it was because I had just been used for sex, and that's all it was. I was so consumed with other areas in my life, I didn't want to be upset about it.

I chalked it up to the fact that I was probably just sex, and decided it would probably be best to just leave him be. We spoke briefly for the last time, and after he sent a text message, I got caught up being busy. We just never spoke again after that. 

All of this time, I thought he didn't want to speak to me. Yet I was so confused as to why he would reply to my messages, tell me he was interested, and make that clear to me.

I had to message him yesterday, as I got some important news that related to something that he is involved him. It was a short, pleasant message, in which I told him a funny story, had a giggle, and told him that I hoped he was doing well.

He responded. Which I didn't think he would, as he openly admitted the whole time we were hanging out that he generally just won't respond to someone if he doesn't want to talk to them.

But the daggers that came out of that text message response.. Were intense. There was no harsh words, there was no calling me names or being mean. But I could tell that he was angry at me, or that he was gritting his teeth when writing it. 

But, for some absolutely ridiculous moment of clarity I realised.. I stopped talking to him. He was interested. I let my own insecurities get in the way.

It sounds so silly but.. What an epiphany.

I think it might be best to just leave him be now. I just wanted some advice about that.

A little background info that I think is relevant: I've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years. We've have a good relationship so far. He is a very friendly guy, almost too friendly. He gets along very well with guys and especially girls. I do find this a bittersweet trait. I am not particularly the jealous type, unless it is warranted. Before we dated, we were simply just friends although there was always a spark between us. I know of minor details about his past hook ups/ relationships. Particularly, I know of a couple of names of the girls he's been with before me. I know that the past is the past and its not relevant to our current relationship, but something happened tonight that has me feeling like a crazy, jealous girl; AND I HATE FEELING THIS WAY!! 

Before we dated, I remember his friends talking about how he used to sleep with this girl often and they almost dated. It never fully turned into a relationship, and Ive been told that was due to him being shallow about her appearance. Apparently, when he was going through the phase of I don't wanna be tied down that most of my friends go through around college age, he strung her along. Her name is Sarah. Sarah and I have been introduced once because of mutual friends. When we met, my boyfriend did that extra friendly thing that I have gotten used to, but it still makes me a little jealous. 

Tonight, he tells me that he is out getting drinks with a friend from his past. I asked who it was and he told me it was Sarah. I don't think he knows that I am aware about their previous hook ups because he never directly told me, only his friends mentioned it when him and I weren't even together yet. I was immediately a little upset, but hey at least he was honest. I asked if this was the same girl he used to sleep with often and he said, No, its not the same Sarah. He blatantly lied to me. I know this is the same girl. I am 100% positive. Why would he blatantly lie unless he was trying to hide something? As I type this I feel more crazy jealous but I would really appreciate any advice you fellow redditors have for me.

Please keep in mind he told me who he slept with when we were both wasted so I don't think that he remembers telling me names. He has no idea I know about this girl and it upsets me he lied to me about who he is hanging out with right now.

While we aren't what seemed to be each other's ideal match, we ended up hitting it off really well and have great chemistry together.

23987,Breakups,2ceiau,"So, I apologize in advance if this is jumbled, I just broke up with my girlfriend of a bit over a year.  Us being so young, it does feel like a long time.  But about my problem.

We had both felt it coming for a couple weeks. We hadn't been doing as much, hadn't been talking very nicely.  The problem (at least from my point of view) is that she doesn't put any effort into our relationship.

For example, she never makes plans, and as I am the one who is always stuck with the bill for both our date and gas, I find it really annoying that she doesn't even try to make plans, but lets me do all the work and then pay for it.  Also, she never starts conversations, which makes just simply talking difficult. 

She never initiates sex.  I have asked her many times if she feels pressured, and she always says no, yet I always feel like I am not well received.  Granted, she is very attractive, but I am not all that bad looking (or modest, apparently).

All of that being said, I love her.  She cares about me, and once I talk to her, she will carry on a nice discussion.  She is attractive, and is always accepting of my choices.  I am often not very nice to her, and she always forgives me.  She is a nice person, with whom I love being.  

So when we broke up, we agreed that in a week we would meet again, and that If she could give me a reason to get back together, we would.  Now I need to know, was this a mistake?  Am I leading her on?  I do intend to get back with her if she can show she cares, but how do I judge that?  Any advice would be helpful.

23988,Infidelity,2urntt,"Sorry for the wall of text I tried to condense as much as possible. So I have known my girlfriend for about 7 years and dated 4 of those. I was actually in the process of about to pop the question when about 4 days ago after she was asleep her phone went off in the middle of the night on the couch next to me. Which never happens. Now she has got the thing under lock and key even individual apps have passwords on top of the one to get into the phone. She didn't know that you could still see the texts tho without unlocking the phone. So I picked it up to look at who would be texting this late at night.


I've had some suspicions that something was up for a while now, but chalked it up to me being paranoid as I have been cheated on in past relationships. As the titled says my suspicions where confirmed. It was a ex that she has been texting sense around Halloween. There was no small talk and it slowly got into romance/sexual it was straight into it all from the beginning. Dirty talk, pictures, love poems, making fun of me behind my back, even went as far to say she was going to disappear out of the country with our son and him.   


Needless to say I was upset and confronted her with it right away. She took the phone outta my hands and said it was just a drunk friend. Which I already knew was a lie. She started to delete things from their conversation. Fighting ensued and she finally came clean. She said they never actually met (not sure if I believe that or not) but said it was just as it looked like. I left with my son to my moms house for the night and next day to calm down. 


Came back and we talked. She wants to work it out with me and says she made a stupid mistake. Told me that it was because she felt I no longer loved her, and the rest was out of anger/ she enjoyed the attention from another guy. Which I don't understand the no longer loved her part. We where going good. No arguments, no fighting, nothing negative at all. So not really sure where she got that. She wants to see a couples counselor and one for her personally because she thinks it stems from deeper issues. I am hesitant but willing to work on it for now.


There's a lot more details but really hard to put it all down without making this a novel. Really I just don't know where to start. I have all these emotions and I don't know what or how I should approach this. I mean we own a house together. Have a son. our lives are together even tho we are not married.

I kind of played surrogate bf..? She likes me more, but she doesn't want to leave that guy, reason is she lost her virginity to him (he cornered her in a hotel room once, just once). And its a big deal to her.  (especially for us highly traditional Asians)

She seems to like me a lot, but whenever I've heard her talk about relationships she seemed sort of gloomy, and I could tell there was something going on there.

I really like this girl, she's cool, funny, cute, and the like, but I'm not sure if I should give up on the idea.  The problem is that while we flirt a lot, and she's very aware of the fact I am into her (and flirts back), she is pretty honest about not being over her ex yet.  I know they broke up a few months ago, and my mutual friends have told me that her fiancé basically dumped her after admitting he was cheating on her with her best friend.

My problem is this, I like this girl a lot, but I'm not sure how I should really proceed.  I am not exclusively tied to her, if I meet another girl I like I'll pursue it.  But to be honest, in getting to know her I've become more attracted to her.  I haven't been hounding her too much, and I can tell she respects that.  We also haven't had sex (kissed a few times) or been overly physically intimate.  I can respect that she's emotionally fragile, but I also have feelings for her too.

Whatever happens, I've managed to keep my emotions pretty abated, I can tell this could go either way and end up with me getting really disappointed, and so I've made a conscious effort to not get too emotionally attached, just simply because I can tell I have no control over the situation.

Mike and I have been together for 5 months.


I first met him 10 months ago at a friend’s (Jane’s) get together. I thought Mike was pretty amazing at the time, but he had a girlfriend Tara that he was crazy about, so I respected and admired his feelings and put him in the “don’t even think about it” basket. After that I occasionally wondered what they were up to, and hoped he was doing well.


Fast forward 5 months and I haven’t seen him since. I go meet up with Jane for her birthday do in the city, and it seems Mike will be joining us. It becomes clear that Tara had broken up with Mike a month ago. At the time I was in a rather nasty FWB situation (in which both of us were clear we would keep looking for someone else) that I was trying to get out of, and we commiserate about bad relationships. During this discussion, I make it clear that I’m not interested in FWB situations in the future, as I have had a number of them, and I felt that they were causing me to lose my sense of self and my sense of self-worth. 


The night continued and though I found him attractive, I didn’t make any moves because I thought he was out of my league (I am admittedly overweight, though I have a very pretty face). As such, I was pleasantly surprised when he kissed me. He came back to my house that night because public transport in our area is shitty and it was too late for him to get home. I made him sleep on the couch though, because Jane had already arranged to stay in my room and it was her birthday. 


Anyway, Mike and I first had sex the next day, I made it clear again that I wasn’t interested in FWB. Over the next month, we spent nearly all of our time together. He was clear that he still wasn’t fully over Tara but he also made it clear he was moving on. I was ok with this, due to his emphasis on moving on. So it came as a shock to me when he met up with Tara pretty close to one month into our relationship and tried to get back together with her. This failed, and he told me about this immediately with remorse. I told him that he had really hurt my feelings, and there was a big difference between “moving on with me” and “actually, you’re just the place holder”. We parted that night amicably, and I thought it was over and we would just be friends. It seems this wasn’t his understanding. When he next made the moves on me, I made it clear that I could only forgive him if he really was moving on and was invested in us, he said he was.


I thought everything was going fairly well from there, until about a month ago (4 months into our relationship) he told me he wasn’t in love with me. I hadn’t expected him to be, it was only 4 months after all, and he was still quite fresh from a serious break-up. However, I did think this was his way of telling me it was over. I told him this, he reassured me it wasn’t, it’s just that when they broke up Tara told him she hadn’t been in love with him for a year beforehand, so he didn’t want me to feel like I was being lied to. I accepted this and told him that if he did want to end things between us, all he had to do was tell me. I also told him my numerous reasons for liking him as much as I do, and he said that he felt “it” when I told him that.


Fast forward to this weekend. While out walking, he brings up the concept of an open relationship, I ask “why? Monogamy’s not that boring is it?” he says it is. At the time I just said I couldn’t cope with an open relationship. I know that he’s not usually into open relationships, because he’s previously told me that when he’s with a girl he really cares for he only sees her, this is why Tara ending things by cheating on him was so devastating. This has lead me to the conclusion that if he wants an open relationship with me, he doesn’t care for me much at all now, and he can’t see himself doing so in the future. Essentially, given the lack of stable love in this relationship, my perception is that if we take this step we will be nothing more than FWB. Further, the only words of affection he’s ever given me are that I am the best person to talk to he’s ever met. So he loves my company, wants to be around me all the time (seriously, he’s quite clingy) but he doesn’t want to love me or commit to me beyond his commitment to monogamy, which he just tried to take back.


For me, this is not enough. In the past month I’ve realised that I’m falling hard for Mike. Despite his asshole tendencies, I believe he’s a fundamentally good guy who is just not over the betrayal he felt at the ending of his last relationship. To me, he is my perfect match, I haven’t begun to feel anything like this for someone in over 10 years (I think this is why I’ve put up with so much shit already). However, his behaviour so far lets me know that I’m not the right person for him, at least, not right now. He wants to travel and see other people, but he wants to do it with the safety net of me to always be there for him. I think this is unfair to both of us. It’s unfair to him because he won’t truly be having these experiences when he takes away the risk, I think this lessens his chance of finding the one for him. It’s unfair to me because I love him, with all of my heart, more than I’ve ever loved anyone else, and I can’t stand there loving him, having sex with him, being in a committed relationship with him, and seeing him fall in love with someone else. 


So, because I love him, and because I love me, I need to end it with him. But how do I tell him that I’m breaking up with him because I love him too much, and as such, out of self-preservation, I need to go no contact, when he has previously told me that having me there is the only thing keeping him sane and happy at the moment?


---   
**tl;dr**: I love him, he’s suggested an open relationship (something he wouldn’t do if he thought there was a chance for us long term), though he respects my no to this. I think it shows he’ll be happier if I end it with him. How do I tell him I’m breaking up with him, and don’t want to speak to him again, because I love him too much?

Disclaimer: I am 20 and still don't know which form of its/it's is correct, do not judge me because there are going to be a TON of grammar (and possibly spelling) mistakes in here. Also this is from my personal experience, I don't think there's any rule to relationships at all but these are things I wish I knew going into it. 

So the story: I'll try to keep it short of course. Me and my ex-boyfriend met when I was 17 and he was 19 and instantly fell head over heels for each other. We were the couple that everyone wanted to be, the one people all agreed would get married after college, the ones that had no issues staying in on a Friday night doing nothing (or coming home at 12AM on a Saturday night to do nothing). We were inseparable and each others' whole lives, as it always is. I was the happiest person in the world when I was with him, and he knew me in ways I didnt even know myself (cliche yet true), its a strange sort of feeling I guess, a feeling of completeness and of just pure happiness. You wake up every day a little bit happier than everyone else and get to go to bed knowing that someone you love with your whole heart loves you too. Its a fantastic feeling, in all honestly. Just to give you perspective as to how much I loved this man; every time I saw him my face would light up and I would gasp, every time something was wrong in his life my day was ruined, every time we fought I felt physical pain and every time I was with him my life was completely surreal. It wasn't just young love, it was something other people caught on to, someone people our age didn't experience yet. I cannot stress that enough.

Like all relationships we had our rocky point, we did at one point break up but we knew we couldnt be happier without the other and therefore always had this impending draw to each other. This time was rough though, we fought a lot and had to talk every day for hours upon hours trying to work at it and figure out our issues. After about a year we were back on track and things were good again. We got back together and things just weren't the same. There were a lot of personality changes, I wasn't the same 17 year old he was definitely not the same 19 year old I had met. We definitely had realized just how much we had grown apart but tried to make it work regardless. Our relationship began to fade, I wasn't as happy as I was, this feeling of safeness and completeness turned to emptiness and doubt. I started noticing so many flaws in him, things I didn't want to notice. The things that used to just bother me now ate me away. Everything was the same but something drastically had shifted, I began to see our relationship in ways that completely contradicted how I felt a year beforehand. 

I'll never forget what that last month felt like, here was someone I loved with all my heart, someone I thought would father my children, someone who inspired me and brightened my life...and yet I just knew our relationship was over. I found this quote Promise me you will not spend so much time treading water and trying to keep your head above the waves that you forget, truly forget, how much you have always loved to swim. Meaning, if you constantly have to work at something you're probably forgetting what it felt like to love it so much in the first place. I realized that this was us, I was the one treading water and I had forgotten how truly happy I used to be in the relationship. I cried myself to sleep every night for a month, he obviously caught on and would ask me questions; why weren't we having sex anymore, why wouldn't I come over anymore, why was I so distant? The truth of the matter is I don't think I could bring myself to look at him without feeling pain. Mind you, I still loved this man so much, SO much. Finally he broke up with me because he knew I didn't have the strength to do it myself. 

The truth is that I couldn't bring myself to break up with him, I didn't want to not be with him, I didn't want to break up but in my mind I didn't want the relationship (which is such a weird feeling might i add). There was a lot of crying on both of our parts, a lot of questioning, a lot of emptiness. Some mornings I would roll over in bed and let myself believe that I'd get to see him, just to get that old feeling of ecstasy back. Some days I hated him, for never buying my flowers, for not making enough effort in our relationship and so many other things. Most days I just wanted to rewind and revisit myself at those happier times.  

So, I'm 6 months out of the breakup 3 months with consistent no contact(ish) and even though I am still feeling the pain, here are some tips along with some things that you will experience and are TOTALLY normal in a breakup:

1) If you're not having sex anymore there is a serious problem. This is not something to be taken lightly, this is something that almost everyone notices leading up to their breakup. I think a part of it is that you don't feel as connected to the person anymore, you don't feel like allowing yourself to be bare naked in front of them anymore because you're not comfortable allowing yourself to be emotionally bare in front of them anymore. Once you begin to become unhappy in the relationship you really won't want to have sex anymore. This may come in the form of excuses, you may blame it on too much work or being stressed but in retrospect when you haven't had sex in over a month and can't bring yourself to, there's a problem. 

2) Every single day will be different. Some days you are going to walk around with your head held high and ask yourself why the hell was I ever upset over this relationship to begin with?! and some days you'll find yourself in bed on a Friday night at 9:30 watching PS I Love You crying your eyes out, trying to remember what it felt like to be loved that much. This is totally normal and take it day by day, there is no due process in a breakup; every day will be different the first day will feel much different than the second and the second could feel the same as the 365th, it isnt exactly a process its an experience. 

3) Regain yourself. One of the most beautiful things in a relationship is that youre not afraid to give a part (or all) of yourself to your SO. Unfortunately, this is part of what makes breakups so different. This person will always have this special part of you, you have given them everything and probably have nothing left to give at this point. The only thing you can do here is regain YOU. For some this is changing your appearance, quitting smoking, getting a new job, for me it was regularly exercising and redoing my room. You don't need to reinvent yourself but do something that makes you feel as though you have full control over. Also, accept that that part of you is gone (or temporarily gone). Right now they have your emotional, optimistic, whole-hearted self and you're probably left with the (500) Days of Summer watching, love doesn't exist, murmuring self. That's totally normal to feel but try to take possession of yourself again. This will take time (no I have not fully experienced this yet). 

4) No contact. This is on every single one of these so I couldn't disregard it. No contact, no contact, no contact. The way you act during your breakup does not in any way represent the relationship you had accurately AT ALL. Holding on to the other person will only hurt you and them more, and will prevent you from envisioning your life without them. We're all scared to let go of the other person, how could someone who was your whole life just turn into nothing overnight? How did you get to this point? Unfortunately the other person cannot help you answer these questions, these are questions you can only answer through self-reflection of the breakup. You're going to want to reach out and you probably will honestly (I've made this mistake), but the truth of the matter is that you're not going to find what you're looking for by talking to the other person. It isn't going to feel the same as it did and neither of you are truly going to know what to say. There's no point in running on fumes in relationships.

5) Remember the good and the bad, but remember it for what it was. So many times people will look back on their relationship wishing they could go back to those happy times where the relationship was good. Of course this skews your perception and distracts you from the fact that at the time breaking up was the right choice. Try to remember the bad too, yes we all know that the highest of the highs are more significant than the lowest of the lows but it is important to remember both. At the same time, dont perceive the person as completely horrible and unforgivable in your head. They probably aren't and you won't have enough anger to cover up your heartbreak for the next 1-5 years (depending on how long it takes).

6) Do not allow yourself to regret anything. This is very hard to do but when you find yourself beginning to guilt yourself remind yourself that regret is pointless. You cannot go back and stop yourself from deciding to date that person, you cannot go back to the night where you shouldn't have said that, you cannot go back and most importantly if you could you can't change the way you felt anyway. When you feel yourself trying to do this remind yourself: never regret anything, because at one point (even if it was just for a millisecond) it was exactly what you wanted. 
*In truth you'll never truly be sure that you made the right decision. It will be very difficult to confidently tell yourself that you were right to end that relationship (if it is a perfectly healthy one, of course) and this is something that most people struggle with. My friends ask me all the time, so what are you going to do now without him? when i answer I dont know they always ask me if I'm scared and every time the answer is terrified. I am absolutely terrified, I havent been single in 3 years, I lost the love of my life but I am learning. In truth breakups are extremely terrifying because they leave a ton of questions you can't answer: did i make the right decision? Where will my life go? Will we ever speak again? How is (s)he doing? Embrace the fact that you can't answer these questions and let that represent all the new possibilities your life has just opened up to. 

7) Let yourself feel. This in my opinion is the most productive thing you can do for yourself. Never stop yourself from feeling sad during this time period. You're going to get tired of having flashbacks, you're going to get sick of missing them and you're going to want to force yourself not to feel this way. With emotions I always find that the best way out is through, if you're feeling sad that day let yourself be sad, if you want to reminisce on the happy and can't distract your mind let yourself do it. Its totally normal and better in the long run. There isn't any right way to do a breakup and your emotions are always justifiable so just let yourself feel them and drink them in. If you try to force yourself to feel another way, they'll find their way back in and hurt more. Some days I'll be feeling like I'm over my ex-boyfriend but then when I'm laying to go to sleep my mind will start reconstructing his old room, literally piece by piece (his bed, his desk, etc.). Of course I don't want to do this, its like twisting the knife but the more I try to suppress it the more I prolong it trying to creep its way back into my thoughts. Don't question your emotions, your mind is trying to surface something for a reason and even though you may not understand it its important to let the thought run its course. Let yourself feel, it'll suck but breakups are supposed to suck.

8) DO NOT REBOUND. Your friends will all tell you that you need to distract yourself, get yourself back out there, the best way to get over someone is to get under someone new. Please don't do this. Going out and flirting is okay, even the occasional random hook up, we all do it because no one wants to be lonely for a night. But most of the the time the first person you're dating right after your breakup will not be the person you're ending up with. You'll start to realize that this person has all the qualities you wish your ex did/didn't have (for example my ex boyfriend was extremely smart and manipulative, the guy I dated after him was as dumb as a brick) but one day you'll realize that they're missing all the things you loved about your ex. You'll compare the two relationships, the two people and this is a huge sign you're not over your last relationship. If your ex is still in your mind most of the time, if you're still thinking about them when you're with the other person then you shouldn't be rebounding at all. It also isn't fair to the other person, dating them just because they aren't your ex. It isn't fair to keep them around just because you're afraid of being lonely. You have to be alone right now, and you have to feel lonely. Covering up your emotions through someone else will only last as long as you keep the other person around. This is just my personal experience but I've spoken to others who do have the same experiences as well. Once you learn to be okay being alone and once you stop craving the love of another person then you have regained yourself and then can start dating again. What left do you have to give to this new person if your ex still has this part of you?

9) Never be afraid to vent, and in venting don't censor your feelings. Everything you are feeling in your breakup is COMPLETELY normal. Seriously, as dramatic and irrational as it seems it is normal. It is normal to think of driving to their house at 3AM to see them, it is normal to want to wish them (or yourself) dead, it is normal to wonder about the future for both of you and chances are someone else has been through this and has felt similar to you have. What I have found is that more or less all breakups are very similar and we all make the same mistakes but don't listen to someone's advice until you've experienced it for yourself (we don't realize not to touch the stove from our parents telling us, we have to burn ourselves first). So, now that you're on the other side of the breakup never hesitate to reach out to someone about it. They have the most enlightening perspectives on it and its good to know that you're not alone in your feelings. Breakups are scary because you probably thought the only person who understood you so well was your SO but that's probably because you only allowed yourself to open up to them. You'll find a fulfilling feeling when you allow others to see your vulnerable side as well. This is extremely important because you'll feel less dependent on your SO. 

10) Keep reminding yourself that you're going to be okay. Breakups are the rudest of awakenings and its going to be absolutely horrible but in life there is time and time heals everything. One of my favorite quotes is from Wish I Was Here, when they say on the other side of heartbreak is wisdom. Nothing is more true than this so keep breathing, drink in all the emotions you are about to feel and take it day by day. 

TLDR: Take care of yourself, take it day by day, don't rebound, don't censor or block your emotions, don't regret anything, you'll never truly be sure you made the right decision but trust your gut.

I'm a heterosexual 31M and I have very little romantic/relationship experience. Until the relationship that just ended, the longest relationship I've ever had was 2 weeks and it barely even counts as one. I tend to be afraid to approach women and feel awkward doing so, and while I don't have low self-esteem in other areas of my life, I do lack sexual and romantic confidence.


My GF [27F] broke up with me last night after being together for 11 months. It wasn't a sudden breakup; the issues leading up to the break were apparent for months beforehand. Now, there were numerous problems with our relationship, but the one that essentially damaged it irreparably was the fact that, due to my lack of sexual confidence, when she would not be interested in sex, I would feel hurt and take it personally. Eventually this led to her wanting to have sex less often, which led to me feeling more hurt, complaining about how our sex life is dying, etc. And it just snowballed into the relationship ending.


The truth is, neither of us really wanted the relationship to end but neither of us could think of a way to repair it after the damage that had been done. Anything I do now to fix it will be interpreted through the lens of trying to pressure her into sex, and I think it may be difficult if not impossible for me to resolve my issues regarding sex and approval while in a relationship.


I know I am responsible for handling myself properly, and I probably wouldn't have handled the situation in such a blatantly poor manner if this weren't my first long term relationship. I think I wanted sex for approval, which isn't healthy. What I need help with is; how do I become more sexually confident so that the next time I am in a relationship, the same thing doesn't happen again?

The guys took me out to a strip club and I got a dance (edit*: see update below with additional details). My fiancee at the time didn't know about it, and believed that I would never be the type of person who would do such a thing.

Upon coming back, I regretted everything and felt extremely guilty, but couldn't bring myself to tell her. I was afraid that she would leave me, and at the same time, I committed to myself that I would never be unfaithful to her ever again. Fast forward a few months into autumn, we get married at city hall, and even though it's just a civic wedding with paperwork, it was the happiest day of my life. We currently are planning to hold the actual wedding ceremony next spring...

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago, everything starts to unravel and fall apart. At this time, I need to digress and explain that I have been a porn user for a long time since adolescence, and although it's not a daily habit, it is something that I look at a few times a month. Since getting married though, I've actually been trying to quit by the end of this year (subscriped to the nofap ideaology). Anyway, she stumbled upon me looking at porn one evening, and felt very hurt as 1) I kept this hidden from her all along, and 2) I just told her earlier that evening that I felt too tired for sex.

We start talking it through, and she asks if there's anything else I've been hiding from her, to which I tell her about what happened over summer. At this point, she shatters into pieces, and she's been a broken soul since then. We talk about it pretty much every day or every other day, and have cried a lot like never before.

Almost a month later now, she cannot get over this, and cannot decide between going on with the wedding and staying with me (because she loves me), or splitting up and cancelling everything (because she hates me too). I've suggested marriage counselling, but we both know that it is a waste of money and we won't feel comfortable talking with a stranger in-person.

I've told her that I'm extremely sorry, and that I would never be unfaithful again. I succumbed to that mistake over summer, and although it is not right, at the time I justified it in my mind by telling myself I'm getting married soon, so this is the last time I can do something like this, and I will never do this again. It was a serious moral lapse and I've felt like shit when I think about this since, even before I told my fiancee/wife. I promised myself and to her that I would be a better husband, that if she can move on from this, we can turn our 7 years of happiness into many, many more years/decades of wonderful memories.

Still, she told me this morning just before leaving the house, that she cannot forgive, cannot forget, and pains her when she thinks about it and sees me. How can I help her, and convince her that our love is strong enough to conquer this mistake? How can I heal my wife's wounds?

---

**[update with details]** What happened at the strip club was I got a dance and the stripper actually tried to jack me off. She offered a blowjob but I refused, and the handjob felt pretty bad too so I stopped her after a while. At this point I was feeling so shitty (emotionally), that I told my friends I wanted to leave the club, and I actually took a cab and left by myself.

I don't think the porn thing is bothering her as much as 1) another woman was physically intimate with me, and 2) her trust and idea of me as a guy who would never do these things have completely been destroyed.

24015,Breakups,1p25tw,"My girlfriend of two years broke up with me two weeks ago and I'm still pretty raw from the whole experience. We dated for a year in person and then shifted into a long distance relationship a year in. Things were always murky in terms of when/how we would fix the distance gap and that coupled with some personal anxiety issues I think were the primary catalyst for our breakup. 

Now, I know a lot of the advice on this site is often times one-size-fits-all approach with this stuff, one of which is that the specifics of the split don't matter, but I'm still having some trouble in my mind going over the details of the breakup. We had gotten into an argument the day before about how the distance between us was going to play out, but I thought it was all resolved by the time we finished. I called to apologize the day after, but it turned into round two of the fight and we decided to take a week of space for ourselves. She asked me to call her back in a week. She was under the impression that this was us officially breaking up; I didn't think that was the case. I'm 99% sure infidelity wasn't an issue, although if it was, I'd rather know about it so I have a reason to hate her/move on. 

What really irks me about the whole thing was how the split was wrapped into an argument that we were having. I know I'm at fault for not keeping my cool through that weekend, but it just seemed so strange and sudden. She literally *the day before*, was talking about me coming to her for Halloween. People say that even though breakups seem sudden, it's always in either/both parties minds before the event. What I don't understand is why she would have still be talking about our future plans one day and ending it with me the next? I know she's probably confused and hurt (as am I), but I don't see how an argument between us can be the catalyst for it all falling apart. If this was something that seemed calculated/thought out, I feel like I could come to terms with it eventually, but this emotional split is really hurting me psychologically. 

I called her once a couple days after to try to get some form of closure for the both of us, but she didn't answer the phone. I've now since for the past two weeks accepted no contact and have been doing my best just to get over her. I have good days and bad days, as I'm sure everyone does, but I keep dwelling on the seeming spontaneity of the whole thing. I at one point had hope of calling her after she takes the GRE's in November to get some closure for myself, but I'm now wondering if that's even a good idea. She was my first real love and I want to move on, but am having trouble sleeping at night. Can anyone give me some closure on this? Thanks....

24020,Dating,2sbpfw,"We met over Thanksgiving break in November at a party and after we met we pretty much spent the whole weekend in bed together. After break, we both went off to separate colleges for two weeks but texted every single day over that period pretty much 24/7. We talked a lot about sex but also about ourselves and stuff we wanted to do over winter break with each other, such as going out to eat, etc and even kind of dabbled a little bit into what it would be like if we were ever together in a relationship. He was the one who brought a lot of this conversation up. Also, I usually wouldn't just casually text about sex with someone who I just met but for some reason I felt this connection with him over it because we found that we're extremely sexually compatible in terms of the things we like and libido. 

We planned on spending a lot of time together over winter break. Which we did, however it was pretty much just hooking up every time and I found myself initiating a lot more than I thought. We also never really texted at all over break except to figure out a time to hang out, which I know can be good to talk in person rather than over text however whenever we hung out he was always in a rush to leave because he had places to be and we didn't really have time to talk. Now that we're both back at school he hasn't texted me at all. I texted him the night he got back to ask how the drive back was and he responded and never texted me back after that (that was just Sunday night).

I really like this guy and I wouldn't be worrying except that I assumed we would be texting and talking a lot more. Towards the beginning of break we would kiss goodbye after we met up and then towards the end that stopped happening. So essentially I guess the main question is if he liked me would he text me? Should I continue texting him even if he doesn't seem interested in keeping a conversation? But also I guess I just want somebody else's viewpoint and if it looks like it's going anywhere anymore. 

I understand we've only known each other for a little over a month but it was intense in the beginning and now it's worrying me that it's slowed down, especially because he was the one doing most of the initiating and initiating conversations up until winter break. Also I guess just to add in he just broke up with his ex in September after about a year of being together. 

I was planning on asking him how he saw us at this point in person before break was over but it just never felt right at the time and now I don't know when the next time I'm gonna see him again will be. I'm thinking I should just let this go and let him go but at the same time I don't want to cut it off just yet. Also...I guess it would be important to note that I drunkenly let him take a video of me sucking his dick so I feel like since he has that I can't just simply cut ties. Also, if this even matters he still looks at all my snapchat stories. 

I don't think he's playing games, cause I don't think guys play games like this in dating but that's what I'm trying to tell myself...:/

So I started hanging out with my group of friends from high school on a very regular basis after about year apart. We drink at my friend's house quite a bit, and sometimes people from our graduating class stop in to hang out. One of these people is a girl, lets call her S. S has hung out with the group quite a bit because she's close friends with one of my friends.


Me and S seem to hit it off pretty well, at least when we're drunk. We always seem to flirt and touch each other, and she doesn't seem to flirt with anyone else but me. Right here it would seem like I could just go for it and not have a problem, but there's more to it than that. We're both pretty shy people, and we never seem to flirt sober like we do when we're drunk. For whatever reason, alcohol seems to make us want each other. I never really talked to her to much outside of when she hangs out with the gang, because I wasn't sure if she actually liked me or if it was just the alcohol clouding our judgement.


It happened a couple days ago when we all went to a hotel and club for my buddy's birthday. We pre-drank in the hotel, and I had way too much to drink, so they ended up going to the club while I was passed out on the bed in the room. S was there, and she left the club early because she said her feet were sore. She then came up to the hotel room, got into bed with me, and we cuddled for like an hour. I could have definitely made a move on her, but I was unfortunately to drunk to realize what was happening. Some shit went down when the rest of our friends came back up from the club, and S and one of her friends left because one of my friends was starting to get overly aggressive at everyone.


The next day I decided to text both S and her friend to see if they were alright, because I felt like I could have done more to mediate the situation if I wasn't so drunk. I also saw this as a good opportunity to start texting S now that I saw that she may like me. I basically asked her if she's alright, and we sent maybe four messages back and forth until she stopped responding. She hadn't been on Facebook for about a day to even see that I sent her a message, but she was online about an hour ago and she didn't open my message.


I don't know if she's going to keep the old conversation we were having going, or if it was the natural end of it. I wanna keep talking to her in the week, but I don't really wanna be sending her messages if she hasn't even opened the previous ones. Maybe I'm just being to anxious, but I wanna be careful about how I handle this because she's friends with my friends and I don't wanna come off the wrong way.


What do you think of this /r/Relationships[1] ? I really don't know if I should wait for her to respond, or if I should just say Hey what's up? sometime next week and start a new conversation with her. I'd like to hang out with her just the two of us at some point, but I don't know exactly how I'm going to get to that point.

We met travelling in Nicaragua where she is currently directing a non-profit and as I was down there we travelled together and I lived and helped her out for about 3 months, until I had to come up to Canada for work as I was completely out of funds. I intended to work here for about 2.5 months until she returned back to the U.S. to continue her contract and I'd go and live with her there.

She is pulling a huge amount of hours each week at her job and she finally managed to get 3 days off, where she went to another town to go out and have fun with a colleague. I encouraged her because I know how it helps her relieve stress to go out dancing and meeting people, I trusted her 100%.

Yesterday morning at 3am she called me upset and confessed that she danced with a guy and kissed him on the cheek. I told her not to worry too much as I don't mind her dancing, as long as she's not leading anyone on. I got pissed when she said that she hadn't told anyone that she had a boyfriend, of course that's going to tempt guys. She surely likes the attention I get that. We talked and agreed that she should always make that clear and never lead anyone on. She spent the whole day depressed and said she would spend the night reading and go out to watch a film, leaving back to her village the next morning.

This morning at 6am I awoke to a phone call, she sounded absolutely distraught and I knew straight away. She said I've fucked up, I've fucked up really badly. I cheated. As she bursts into tears, and I start screaming at her, waking the entire house up. I calm down enough for her to tell me the entire situation. 

She was having a chilled out night playing pool with her friend. The guy she was dancing with the night before came over and bought them drinks. She told him then that she has a boyfriend and talked all about me. They continue hanging out as friends. But as the night progressed she got drunker and drunker. They started dancing again and at one point he asks her for a kiss, so she did. Immediately she said fuck! and tried walking off, but he kept pursuing her and eventually they made out a couple of times. 

She must've been in a trance at this point. She went to bed and he followed, she told him nothing is happening but that he could cuddle her. She slept for 5 minutes and he was touching and rubbing her. She allowed this for 15 minutes, he started fingering her and pulled her pants off. And at this point she just bursts into tears, gets up and tells the guy she's gotta go and runs out. 

She immediately calls me then. She told me the whole story, she is a very honest girl. I just don't know what to think right now. 

I saw myself spending my life with her. She's perfect for me in every way, I've never felt so comfortable with someone and it's the first time I've felt love so powerfully. We're both travellers and have a unique mindset on life, she's very free spirited and independent. She also has a strong need for physical intimacy and I understand that by me not being there for that, that she'd go crazy without getting anything. I'm pretty open minded sexually and especially in the case of a long distance relationship, I was willing to let her be freer than we would be otherwise. Dancing, flirting, heck even a little kissing I could've allowed. 

I told her this, but wanted her to also keep in mind not to do anything that she wouldn't want me doing either and we'd be fine. She said no she doesn't want any of that anyway. She doesn't like the idea of me doing anything at all with another girl, and I wouldn't anyway. I only desire intimacy with her. 

I can see how full she is of regret. But the trust has been absolutely ripped to shreds, I've never felt so hurt. I am a very trusting person and that's hard to break. I can almost understand if she was blackout drunk and didn't know what she was doing, but she seemed with it when she called. She knew what she was doing. 

She said she will do absolutely anything she can to be with me and will try anything to get me back, even quitting her position and coming up to Canada to be with me. I don't want her to be so drastic. But at the same time I would have a real hard time forgiving her from a distance like this, it seems impossible. I need her in person. I do believe her how sorry she is, however, the deed is done and trust is broken. So hard to get that back in a long distance I just don't know.

I'm devastated right now so my post may be all over the place. I don't have anyone I would wanna tell about this, I just need to rant and get some advice - at least some that's not just dump her! I still love her but I just feel so confused. The hurt is very fresh.

Well, a week later, just today, I found that she was still logged in on facebook on my computer (typical cheating story i know). Anyways, I wanted to see what was up. It didn't take more than 2 minutes of scrolling. She was basically pouring her emotions out page by page to this guy I had never heard of. They had hung out the day that i drove up there. They kissed and she had spent just the previous night at his house. But more importantly when i looked at the messages, (this was tonight by the way) there was an active conversation happening. Right after she sent me the first message in a week saying she was too busy to talk, she was telling her new guy friend that she wanted him to come over and spend the night again. All the things she was going to do to him...right in front of my eyes.

I am so lost right now, a mixture of anger/rage/sadness, which is why i'm writing this even though i'm a bad writer. I don't know what to do with myself, my mind is in shock. 

She has done this 2 times before, once in our first year, and once in our second year, but neither of those had as much emotions involved as does this one. She has not told me anything of this new information yet, and she told me that she had something to tell me tomorrow. But she doesn't know that I know almost everything. 

My question is this: How should I react when she calls me. My first reaction is too say Fuck You, hang up, and end the relationship immediately, but I know that will only make things end worse. Fuck, I love this girl so damn much, she is my first girlfriend, which only makes my attachment more severe. I want to continue this relationship. But 3 times in 3 years? I don't think I will ever trust her again. Should I act totally clueless when she tells me what she's done tomorrow? If i do this I know the most she'll tell me that she did was kiss the guy once. The one thing that I don't want to happen is to make things worse, ie., telling her i saw her messages, would instantly backfire. 

I'm so lost and confused right now. The worst part is being completely helpless: she doesnt want to talk to me, im 10 hours away, talking to the guy will make her even more angrier because he will instantly tell her  . . . i can't do a single thing to stop this.

The last year or so our relationship has been shitty, from time to time my gf has told me i have to think about this relationship, maybe we'll brake up soon, which hurt me really much. But after a while she always tells me she wants to stay together. After that it will stay good between us for a while, but then it will all start over again.

My girlfriend is also really insecure, last week she saw that she gained some weight (about 11 pounds, 5kg) and she flipped her shit. Trying to puke, and after a while taking a knife and saying that she might as well kill herself. I took the knife and called her mom who calmed her down.

Yesterday morning she told me she couldnt have sex with me because she felt fat, and that we wouldnt have sex for about 1,5 months. Then she asked me to think if i wanted to stay in such a relationship. After i got home from work she apologized and told me she wanted to fix things between us.

Did i mention we live together about 650miles from my closest family?

We have some other problems too, but most of them are originating from her insecurities, for example about every other time i want to go out with my friends she feels like shit and i come late because she wants me to comfort her.

We have wonderful times too, i really enjoy being with her, and i really love this girl.

Anyway, my parents tell me that i should breakup with her. Leave her, and to be honest i'm afraid we don't have a future together, but i really love this girl, and i'm afraid i will change my mind later. It's a really big step to make for me to pack my shit and leave, and i find it hard to do so, even though i (most of the time) feel deep inside of me that this isn't healthy.

24043,Breakups,22kiyf,"We have been going through the cycle of trying to be friends, me still just not being prepared for it, him wanting more out of it that I didn't, whatever else. We saw each other today, we talked through things, he said it was not my fault, and we parted ways sad but moving forward. I went to a meeting for the 12-step program I'm in, talked about it, felt a lot better that I was making a decision that would improve my life. 

Now, that being said, since we have been apart in the past month, he found that his best friend's mother, a second mother to him, has a rare form of lymphoma. He is destroyed over it. He does not have many friends, and the one who knows him best has a mother to worry about. Over the past week, I have talked to him, we have cried together, and last night he really snapped and understood what was happening to this woman, like he had just been in some sort of shock. I told him we could meet today, I would help him get a haircut, he would be ok.

We met, he immediately noticed something wrong, I told him we'd talk about it later. He wanted to talk now. I wanted to avoid the conversation about relationships for good. He isn't good for me, but I also want to be here for him without leading him on. I do not want him to be alone. We end up only talking about the relationship, and we part ways without any seemingly hard feelings.

He calls me tonight, from a number I do not have (his mom's phone), and unloads everything that has ever been wrong in his life. Absence of a father, the death of his grandfather years ago, brothers and sisters who don't speak, unsupportive friends, and the illness of his second mom. He vaguely hinted at suicidal thoughts, he told me he felt alone, and I made sure he was at his friend's house and was staying with his friend, because while he is mostly just saying things, I don't want there to be any possibility of truth to it.

Anyway, he was not going to take my absence for an answer. I felt guilty, and responsible for all of his pain, and I told him to do the best with what he had, but if he was completely losing his shit, call me instead of doing it on your own.  Now, however, I feel somewhat abused and hurt. I did not leave him in his moment of need, I left and then a moment of need arose while I was moving on. We tried to be friends in so many ways, but we do not want the same things. I can't be a constant pal to him, especially when he implies that I abandoned him and that this pain is stuff that he absolutely can't deal with and does not want to live through.

So I am stuck. I told him to call if he desperately, absolutely needed to, but I am afraid of where that will go. If I take it back, I am afraid of what he will do. He has attempted suicide, with every intention of succeeding, a few times in the past, not the recent past. I am just so lost. I feel like he really does not have anyone to go to, I know the friends he has and I know they won't be there. But I am so sick of feeling responsible for this, because I am not but he behaves as though I am. If anyone has advice, please help.

24045,Breakups,2cv6oq,"Basically, we have been together for 2 years, semi-long distance. We got together when I was 18 and he was 22, and I had just graduated high school. We had an amazing summer, and then I went to university. We've been long distance for 2 school years now, with me coming home for breaks and him coming down for the occasional weekend. 


I know I need to break up with him, and for several reasons. I've been thinking like this for a while now, making lists in my head, that sort of thing. But I have never gotten close to verbalizing the concerns to anyone else. 


Primarily, I'm concerned that we are moving in two different directions. Completely cliche, older boy wants to settle down, college girl is so not ready for that yet. He says he doesn't want me to feel like I have my wings clipped, however I know that he wishes I wanted to settle down as much as he does. And he is the only person I have seriously been with, and I feel like I need to experiment to find out what I really look for in a relationship.


He also has problems with anxiety and depression, and has often said that he doesn't know what he would do without me, making me feel like a therapist, or like it's my job to fix him. I love him so much, and I know he deserves someone who will want to do that for him. But I can't do that anymore. I am too young and too selfish to take on that kind of responsibility, and I know I shouldn't have to. 


The problem is that there are so many beautiful things about our relationship. He makes me laugh, he is my best friend, he takes good care of me, and we have planned a future together. But I know it's not right anymore and it's not fair to him for me to continue any longer in the relationship.


So I guess I have two questions, the first being how do I do this without making him feel like it's coming out of left field? This will be hard for me, but I know it will be even harder for him, especially because he thinks everything is going just fine. Also, I lose all willpower as soon as I see him. How do I keep my course straight and just do what needs to be done?

So, prior to us breaking up, my (former) girlfriend had wanted to live with me, along with another two of our mutual friends for the upcoming school year. This is great, we've already been living together for a while, there were no major complications, and things would be perfect. However, the summer rolls around, and suddenly things start falling apart. It quickly went downhill, and what I thought was a relationship that was going through long distance troubles ended up being a major issue leading to a not-so-great breakup.




At this moment, things are a bit tense between us. I'm hurt, while she seems to be completely over and done with. Which would be okay, if I had the space to recover. Unfortunately, we were both enrolled in a summer course and now I have to deal with seeing her for the next week and a half, everyday. A mutual friend is trying to keep us both civil with moderate success. 




It's only been two days and I'm realizing that I REALLY need the space in order to actually recover. Whenever she's around, I can't even look at her. I get sick, I lose my appetite and suddenly all of my focus is lost. Call me competitive, but it makes me feel worse that she's not feeling any remorse at all while I'm still feeling so down. 




Reconciliation (naively) was something I had hoped for, as we had worked through this problem in the past, though at this point it's borderlining impossibility. This didn't help me in terms of recovery. Now I'm hurt even more and having extreme difficulty trying to cope. She was one of the most important people in my life and simply great in every way.




I ended up bringing up the fact that I didn't want to live with her anymore. I asked her to leave, and to respect the fact that I need the space to move on. But she seems to think that I'm being abusive, and trying to isolate her from her friends and make them hate her which is entirely not the case. While I am technically kicking her out, I know for a fact that she would be able to find another place to live very quickly.




At the moment, I'm at a loss. I still love her and I still care about her. I definitely don't want her without a place to stay, but I'll probably go insane if she lives with me. I'm still trying to push the idea for her to leave, but now I'm worried that I might be being abusive. Should I just try to tough it out and let her stay, or should I keep pushing the idea?

I have been in a relationship with this girl for 9 months. She broke up with me a little more than 1,5 years ago. I have never liked any other person more than that girl, never took care of a person that much and had no other person take so much care of me, apart from family. I never trusted any other person that much. It wasn't a healthy relationship, but that's not the point. The breakup was very rough, but I got back to my normal life after some months.




Now I go to college, play sports, go to the gym, meet my friends. I was interested in other girls, asked one out, dated her, it didn't work out. I had two little affairs too, it all looks pretty normal. But even though I was seriously interested in other girls, I just can't forget about my ex-girlfriend.

We were together for two years, and broke up about a month ago. Since the break-up we've tried to stay friends, but it's been really difficult. My ex (I'll call him W) keeps going back and forth about whether or not we can stay friends, whether he's angry with me about ending the relationship, etc.



I've been trying to let W work through his feelings and decide whether or not he wants me in his life as a friend. When he asks me not to contact him, I don't, and then when he says that he wants to see me because he's depressed and feels like he doesn't really have any other friends, I invite him over and try to cheer him up. 



A few days ago he told me that we couldn't have any contact anymore because he needed to get over me. Then later that day he texted me to say that he still wanted to talk, but we just shouldn't see each other. I haven't initiated any contact since then. It's just too confusing and exhausting not knowing what I should/shouldn't say to him.


This morning I work up and had this message from him:
I can't sleep and my brain keeps replaying plans and promises we made together and how worthless I must be to let them fail. I was planning a proposal sometime this summer once the car situation was solved. Pointless now, I know. After the last time we broke up you gave me a second chance, took me back and asked me to change a few things for you. And I didn't. I lied and promised I would change if you forgave me. And you did. But I didn't. I kept taking advantage of you. I was a barrier to you living the life you wanted. You wouldn't have done everything you have for me over the last month or put up with everything ive done if you didn't still care about me. But I understand why that's not enough for you anymore. I'm just... really sorry. For ignoring your feelings and everything you wanted from the relationship. I don't blame you for anything. I just... I really miss you. I'll never stop missing you. I love you, my darling [his nickname for me]. I am eternally yours, even though you are no longer mine. You are the first thought of every day and the star of every dream.

His message made me feel guilty and just terrible about myself and the situation. I feel so bad about hurting him.

24059,Breakups,225sp4,"Quick background. When my boyfriend and I started dating, he was extremely conservative and I was rather liberal with my sexual life and behavior. As a result, he indirectly asked me to stop being friends with most of my friends because it hurt him emotionally considering the open way I would act around them and they around me (honestly it was my first real relationship and I just didn't know how to respect a relationship yet). Later on, he had to transfer from an ivy league university to an in-state university due to extreme difficulties and extenuating circumstances within his family. 

Since then, he's been essentially friendless and *only* spends time with me. For the most part I've had friends to hang out with, but he hasn't had any. This year I joined him at the same university, and with me there he's felt like making friends. It's been great! He's been really happy. The past year, he's been clinically depressed but doesn't want to seek help through therapy or medicine. We've been exercising and eating healthier this semester, however, and I think it helps. It's a work in progress, but it's a struggle. 

This spring break, his family went on vacation and stayed with a family friend who used to be in their church before they moved last year. While there, he reconnected with a girl he grew up with in the church (17, F, birthday in august). Since then, they've been communicating literally non-stop through text messages. In the whole three and a half years we've been dating, he's never texted anyone as much as he's texted her in the few weeks since they caught up. When he returned from spring break we had a talk that I also think we needed to have. 

After being together for so long he felt that our relationship had become stagnant. I'm taking 21 credit hours and rarely feel like having sex, and I also don't like to talk about religion or politics (with anyone, ever) and this friend of his loves having those deeper conversations with him. He said I've been enjoying talking to this girl more than you, and that shouldn't be the case. We need to fix that in our relationship.

My immediate thought was that I had been thinking the same thing, I just hadn't used words to think it. I had taken our phones and put them away for dates and whatnot so that we would have more conversations. In my opinion, in hindsight, I had already been working toward this. When he drove me back to campus after the break, I tried to read some of these text messages (honestly thinking, what about those conversations are more intriguing?) but he wouldn't let me. He said he had said some mean things he didn't mean about me and didn't want me to read them.

All throughout the week, I tried to read them and made passive aggressive comments to make him stop talking to her. We would be hanging out, sitting on a bench and talking in the afternoon, and he'd pull out his phone. They were playing a get to know you questions game!  I stormed off, and he asked me to admit I was jealous and I wouldn't because that wasn't a conversation I was ready to have. In the end, all that ended up with was bickering and tension.

That Saturday, I threw a fit about how jealous I was. That he had just identified our relationship had a problem and he was investing more time in this other one, helping this girl think for herself, helping her with college stuff, and overall being a big brother. He said, A year ago, I would have dropped this friendship in an instant to make you feel more comfortable. Now, I'm suffering with depression and talking to her is helping me be a better person and is one of the only mutually beneficial friendships I have in my life right now and I'm not going to lose that right now. 

Also that Saturday, he was out at a shooting range with his friend while I was cleaning his room. His landlord brought me a letter that had arrived in the mail for him--yep, from the girl. Handwritten letter, talking about her parents because she was too uncomfortable about it to talk any other way. I found out later he had sent the first letter. He views letters as strictly a form of communication (previously only having sent them to friends at camp and me while we were long distance and he was at his ivy league school) but honestly, what 17 year old girl writes friendship letters to guess? I don't know, but it made me go crazy.

Sunday, I put up another fight. I was too jealous. I couldn't take our relationships having problems and him being super great friends with this girl. He got exhausted with me and conceded that I could read their text messages and the letter. In between the start of our fight (over skype messages, I was in the library studying) and that ending, though, I contacted his friend on facebook and asked if she would talk to me. She said of course. I had a talk with her, told her all my thoughts and problems with their friendship and why it made me uncomfortable, particularly the timing. Additionally, I told her I would be reading her text messages and letters and anything else she sent to to my boyfriend and I felt she deserved an explanation so that was why I contacted her.

Afterwards, I told my boyfriend that I had called her. He was furious... absolutely furious. He told me that if he went home and tried to talk to her, and she said she didn't feel comfortable talking to him anymore, he would break up with me. And she didn't... and he did.

We moved to being on a break because despite this fight, we really do love each other and want our relationship to work out. He's about to graduate, and we need to have this fixed before we go onto the next stage of our relationship. We didn't talk for a little while, but now we are. Having sex, oral, etc. We're going to a crawfish boil and a concert tomorrow. He has stopped talking to this girl around me, but because they use a texting app (her plan doesn't cover real texts) I can use that app as well to check the times he's texting her. 

And I do, and did ever since I found out she used the app (so for two weeks), and I still do. Every hour. I absolutely hate their friendship and for the most part I don't have a reason to, but I am just so jealous I guess that he is investing that much time to *anyone*, which he has never done before... He found out two days ago that I check the times and they switched to using mobile Skype. I asked him tonight to turn off his phone and sign off skype to study for a huge test he's been agonizing over, and he just went invisible (I sent a couple messages to check, and afterwards he signed off.)

He felt so betrayed by me contacting her and my desperate attempts to read his messages. He was cheated on my an ex that he had been with for over a year and it emotionally wrecked him his senior year of high school (we've known each other for a while.) I know in my heart he would never, ever, cheat on me. His reaction towards friends, classmates, and family when he finds out they have cheated is extremely harsh and unforgiving, and often too extreme. It is personally his number one thing that he can't forgive when it comes to relationships with other people. I *know* he's not interested in this 17 year old girl but it tears me up that he's investing so much time into her. 

The fact that their relationship is giving him things that ours isn't (yes I know that I can make changes and talk about deeper subjects, it's just a matter of getting there. We are both in honors college and honors programs and have no time during the week, and have only had one weekend since this issue happened) eats me up. I keep track of how many times he responds to or checks her messages first... I'm obsessing over it. It's driving him crazy and me crazy.

Basically, **what I want and need to know from /r/relationships** is how much is my hate for this friendship that my boyfriend has justified, and how much is just selfish? 

**TL;DR;** Boyfriend and my 3 year relationship has become somewhat stagnant. He made a new friend that is 100% platonic and talks to her all the time. I freaked out out with jealousy, called her, and made her feel too uncomfortable to talk to my boyfriend until I called her back and apologized. We're on good terms two weeks later, he still talks to her though, but he doesn't text her when he's with me. I obsessively check the time stamps to see how much they talk. WTF is wrong with me?

24060,Dating,1omdb2,"I adore this girl. I'm sure that's quite common around here given the nature of the subreddit, but I adore her all the same. Nearly a decade of adoring her, in fact, which is way too long to be adoring somebody who may not adore you back, and we're getting a bit old for it. Unfortunately for me, she (let's call her Bea) has never given any indication that she sees our relationship as anything more than one between very old, very dear friends. I've never wanted to ruin that, so I've never made any sort of advance.

The other night Bea and I were having drinks together after a couple of months of not seeing one another (she travels a lot for work). I was talking to her about the girl I'm currently seeing, who just so happens (I swear) to look a lot like Bea. Then this happened:

&gt; Bea: So what's up with you and Rosie?

&gt; Me: ...She's a very sweet girl.

&gt; Bea: ..Buuuuut you're going to break up with her.

&gt; Me: I think so, yeah. Maybe. I dunno. She's a very sweet girl.

&gt; Bea: /u/Seikom, **just because she looks like me, that doesn't make her me.**

At this point I spluttered on my drink, made some timid remark that played her statement off as a joke, and rapidly changed the subject. And spent the next three nights kicking myself for missing my shot and puzzling over what Bea possibly could have meant by that comment.

Yes yes, I know that gender essentialism isn't real and everybody communicates differently and if you want to know what she meant you should just ask her.

Granted. All the same, talking it out might help. Is it possible that this was an invitation from her to make an advance? Or just a bittersweet acknowledgment of unrequited love? Or simpler still, a dumb joke? Obviously I am far better positioned to answer those questions than anybody here. Maybe I just need a sounding board, though. What might you have meant, if you were the one saying it? What do I do now? And is it worth risking a trusted friendship over?

But this wasn't how I felt at all. I really loved this girl, she's been my first everything and on April 22nd, we would have reach 1 year together.

I've just never been so fucking broken before. She was the only thing in my life that really gave me happiness, (I have suspicions I have some form of depression from unrelated causes but I am not diagnosed so not sure). 

All day I go to school and get made fun of, (I'm a bit overweight, not crazy ball size but I'm more than average), and whenever I see her at her locker, I feel happy. She was my everything and now she's gone.

Idk, fuck I mean I want her back so bad but I don't know if she really loves me anymore. Lemme go into detail on what she said about our relationship.

She said that under a month ago, we were fine. She was happy, I was happy. But for some reason, she thinks it's because of stress dealing with college and what not, she said she doesn't have fun with me anymore. I've been freaking out all week because she has been talking about breaking up and how I should be happy without her anyways, and I always responded with I would be happy with you and stuff like that. Well, today it fucking happened. She told me she wants to at least take a break. And naturally, I broke down. The most amazing girl I've ever met, seriously, smart, sexy, everything just told me she doesn't want to be with me anymore. 

I understand the word break may mean a glimmer of hope for me but I'm just so disappointed in everything going on with my life that I don't see it that way. 

She also said something about how I don't intellectually stimulate her anymore or something like that. I don't know, I do act kind of silly sometimes, but that's just my personality, and I can be serious when I will. Is this something to be concerned about?

The other thing is I can't get the picture of her moving on with some other guy out of my head. Some guy that's actually perfect for her, someone like me maybe, but more attractive, maybe a bit smarter, more advanced in his field, (I want to go to college for computer science, so what if he was going to be a doctor or something useful). I can't see myself moving on. No one else at my school likes me, I guess I can just try and make it to college but I don't see any place for love in my life other than with her.

Maybe I'm just a fucking dumbass teen who cares too much about his puppy love, as some may call it. I honestly dreamed of marrying this girl. I know that sounds stupid at my age but she is so perfect you have no idea. She is exactly the kind of girl I'm looking for. I need advice, any advice. How to deal with this kind of stuff and how and if I should try and get her back. I really can't bear to see her with someone else. Prom is coming up. I was going to ask her. :/

I realize that he's attracted to my friend but somehow she is totally blind to it and deny it. Sure enough, he makes his feelings known and my friend rejects him. It doesn't change anything everyone is still friend. At this point, I was friend with him but it was more because I had to since he was always at my place.

He doesn't talk much about his 2 month trip but it's the reason I'm hesitant to date him exclusively. I don't want to commit to someone when there's an expiration date. I can't imagine staying with him while he's traveling internationally, visiting his ex and I'm sure other women he met while he was abroad.

I don't know if I should even say anything to him becuase this trip is happening and I wouldn't want him to not go and then resent me.

Everything about her is so perfect to me. She's so sweet, and beautiful, smart, and kind, and I love her so much. She loves me too. The problem is that we can't be together though.

You see, I'm leaving for bootcamp in one week now. I don't have much time left with her, and no matter how many times I plead, her mother refuses to let us be together. I have literally no idea the reason for this. As far as I know, I have done literally nothing wrong as a boyfriend or a person to deserve for her to hate me, but she does anyways. I believe myself that her mother just doesn't want Annie, (we'll call her Annie) to date anybody.

I honestly don't know if it's just because I'm young and stupid, but I believe that this girl is the love of my life. And the fact that I can even ask myself if I'm young and stupid makes it ten times worse, because now I know I'm young, stupid, and aware.

Anyways, every day we were having more fun and would love each other more until yesterday the relationship came to a grinding stop. We agreed a few weeks ago that once I leave for bootcamp, that we would take a break. I mean, she's 16 and I don't want to make her commit to anything that hard (I would be gone for 6 years, with opportunities to come back home ever now and then) while she is only that young. But I don't want to lose her. I'm so conflicted. I feel so unfinished in this relationship, and it is honestly the most painful thing ever to have to say goodbye and I love you in the same sentence. I've poured my heart out for this girl. I've written her letters, I've written her songs. I try to give this girl the whole world on a platter, because I honestly believe she deserves it.

She doesn't see it like that though. She's the classic case of the misunderstood high schooler that hates everyone besides her 3 friends and me. She doesn't think she's smart, or pretty, or worth it. It makes me feel like garbage knowing that I will have to leave her now, without her being convinced of how amazing I know she is.

And now, she's trying her best to try to shush me away from her, because she's convinced she will hold me back, or she's not good enough. The last things we said to each other were that we love each other, and that just stings. How could I let someone I love so much just try to disappear? Sometimes she's hard to read, but I don't think she wanted to break up. I think her mom pressured her to do it, and now that I'm leaving, she's convinced that she has to.

I just got to the point last night where I had to delete all of her information, my facebook, the whole shebang because I can't look at her precious little face without feeling my heart being ripped to shreds... It's the morning after now, and I know now that I never want to lose her.

So, Reddit, what should I do? I don't want to lose her, but I'm at a crossroads in my life that I don't really know what is, or could happen to me. Losing her scares me so badly, and even after 6 years away, I'm fairly certain that I would come back for her. and if there is nothing I can do...

24084,Infidelity,1g7z3f,"I've been in a serious relationship with this girl for almost 7 years now. Before I get into what happened the other day let me just explain our relationship a bit more.

We've been together since we were 13 and had our ups and downs, just like any other relationship. About 4 years ago she cheated on me with some guy that she was physically attracted to (but not in love with), but we worked things out and that's all in the past now.

One of the biggest problems in our relationship is intimacy. We do sexual things like hand and mouth stuff but when we tried to have intercourse, it just didn't fit. (She's very tight, a pinky inside of her will make her squeal) We tried to have intercourse for about 4-5 times after that but eventually just gave up and started doing other stuff. (hooray for multiple holes!) But still our sex life is pretty dull, I consider myself lucky if we do stuff once a month.

Almost every year she falls in love with some random guy (but didn't cheat) but we always worked it out and got past it. We never stuck to the past. It's like it's almost become something ingrained into our relationship. It's something that has to do with her personality, she just falls in love very quickly. We both now recognize it and try to make the best out of it. I always tell her how much I hate it but eventually always forgive her and reconcile because we love each other very much.

Things were actually going quite well, we were both very happy, and very much in love. But then a few days ago, **COMPLETELY** out of the blue, I found out that she went to see a guy she met online. And this guy was not just living near, she actually bought plane tickets to go and see him. Not telling **ANYONE** (not even her parents) that she was going somewhere I did some research and found out that she had intimate conversations with him and was definitely cheating on me.

So I confronted her (while she was with him) and when she came back we had a long talk. She apologized profusely and told me that she'd been living a second life where she'd actually fallen in love with this guy. She told me that she was very sorry and that she had no idea what had gotten into her and that she felt she was a completely different person while doing this.

I'm really angry and emotional about it because there was no point whatsoever where I could blame it on except for the fact that she just did it. There was no difficult period in our relationship, in fact things were looking great! She violated my trust to say the least.

But she silly thing is, and I know that this sound completely insane, I want her back with every fiber in my body. I want her back because I know that she's genuinely sorry for it. I want her back because I love the hell out of this girls and I want her back because, well, she just gets me in a way I've never had before with anyone. The relationship that we share is so profound that I can not imagine, and quite frankly don't want to imagine, spending my days with someone else.

She just took the step of seeing a psychologist about this issue of her always falling for someone else. I think it's a very brave one, and one that shows that she is genuinely willing to change her ways to make this work. In the meantime she doesn't want to talk to me or the other guy in order to get some things straight and promised me she'd tell me when she's made a decision.

I'm generally at a loss here. I know that there's nothing I can do now but let her figure herself out. I hope that she chooses to carry on with our relationship and work on the problems that we have.

I know there's not really a question in all of this rambling but I just wanted to know what you guys think.

I have been friends with this girl let's say named Jennifer for 7 years. Jennifer is the girl of my dreams. I have loved her, been there for her, and tried to do everything to make this girl as happy as can be. I knew her in 9th and 10th grade in high school and then moved 7 seven hours away but we still kept in touch with Facebook. I went to a school in that state and she went to one in hers (parents wanted her to stay home for college understandably) but we stayed in touch tremendously well. We have always been able to talk for countless hours every single day with neither of us getting bored. I can honestly say I have never had such an amazing connection with another human being. 

My freshman year of college I went there to potentially ask her to be my girlfriend. While I was up there I got scared (one of the biggest regrets of my life) and thought that maybe I shouldn't tie myself down so early in college. Even after her obvious disappointment we still remained friends and talked. She after a year started dating a guy named Steve who was weird and gross, and dumped him. Then a year and a half ago she started dating Matt. Matt's a decent guy and I didn't want to get in the way of there happiness so I backed off. Fast forward to now and we are all juniors in college. In the early stages I only occasionally talked to her but was keeping my eye out on her. After this amount of time I realized that they were most likely going to stay together and wanted to at least make my feelings known. However, before I could do so she came to me and said that she still had feelings for me. She also said that she felt this way because she could always talk to me and I listened to her and valued her input while Matt did not always do so. She has said many times that she has felt we are soul mates and I have felt the same. 

I was obviously really happy but didn't want to be a dick to Matt and said that she should think this over and definitely tell him about it and figure that situation out. She did and tells him that it's over and that she wants to date me. I'm ecstatic and say that we should wait a bit out of respect, but still stay in touch and start dating at an appropriate time. She then tells me that after she broke up with him she got a call from Matt asking her to take 3 days to think it over and if she still wanted to leave him then he would accept it, but that he wants her to at least think about it. Perfectly reasonable I thought and was assured by Jennifer she would not be changing her mind. 

Fast forward to a few days ago where she calls me crying saying I can't be with you and I'm sorry I just can't do this to Matt even if I like you more. I'm obviously heartbroken and try to ask why she would rather be with someone that won't make her as happy, and that she doesn't feel as close to which she replies I just don't want to hurt him and I just feel it's the right choice. I try and talk to her more but she hangs up and says that we shouldn't talk anymore.

My roommate at college (A) was talking to this girl (1) for about a month. Then she found out he had cheated on her which not even I knew about but he claimed he wasn't aware they were exclusive (bullshit in my opinion). During the 2 week period while he was trying to get her back he started talking to another girl (2). Eventually he got 1 back and kept things going with 2. He has now been seeing both of these girls for at least a month.

I have called him out on this before but he basically just deflects anything I say and claims he feels remorse when I know he doesn't. I just feel terrible having to see these two girls who are both such nice people and act like everything is fine and I hate that they will most likely hate me when this all comes out and I will be an accomplice.

I never had anything very close to a relationship until I met this girl (married with young kids) at work.  We became really good friends and I visited her at work a lot, always very excited to chat and never thinking anything past friendship.  As we continued to connect very well we started hanging out and eventually she admitted to me she had very strong feelings for me.  This was a MAJOR shock at first, yet in the back of my mind I knew I reciprocated and had been ignoring them.

We continued to spend tons of time together and grew closer and closer.  Eventually she moved across the country for about 9 months, during which time we texted constantly; said good morning and good night, talked about our days, joked around etc.  We were infatuated with each other and we both felt extremely strong feelings for each other; even though we knew it was wrong we didn't break it off, this was my first love and the feelings were intense on both sides (not that that's any excuse).  I knew her marriage hadn't been going well for a long time so I stupidly thought we would end up together eventually.

During a visit here is when we became intimate (before she moved there had been a couple close calls).  She went back home and we continued to talk every day.  A few months after this point things became tough as I wanted more from her and she felt frozen in her marriage due to her children.  Things became rocky and got worse as time progressed.

This is where things became extremely hard for me.  I have a generalized anxiety and panic disorder as well as mild OCD, and my panic attacks and anxiety became more intense and occurred more often.  I became extremely depressed.  I really couldn't understand why she wouldn't leave for me.

She eventually moved back several months ago and we continued to spend what time we could together.  About a month ago we had one final confrontation and have been in no contact (other than one short convo) since.  The break hurt bad and it's been extremely tough for me.  My panic attacks and anxiety are at an all time high, I feel depressed and unmotivated, I feel extremely betrayed, I dream about her most nights.  I switch between extremely missing her and needing her to hating her for leading me on.  I don't know what I want to do and I don't know what to do.  In combo with a mentally/physically exhausting full time job and other stresses, I feel so helpless, sad, and alone.

I had always thought we would at least stay best friends as we were at first and never expected that to be too hard on me.  During our one convo she told me she was currently in a deep depression and wanted to be friends in the future once we were both better.  I told her I don't know if I could do that, even though deep down I still want her in my life.

24105,Breakups,2bgulj,"I guess I felt the need to vent tonight. This girl is the very reason I breathe. We met early on. Started out as friends, after a month or two I noticed we had a lot in common and asked her to be mine. It only went up from there. She was the first on my mind waking up, the last as I would fall asleep.

Things went absolutely perfect for a good while, we had given each other cute little nicknames we always used. More than one were given to her. We had hundreds of inside jokes. I loved everything about us. I proposed to her and it made it so much better. We were so happy. We planned a lifetime together and it all came crashing down because I had a single moment of weakness.

At the beginning of our relationship, I agreed to quit all my bad habits (i.e. smoking, drinking, so on); which I stayed true to, for the most part. It's always hard to just up and quit, right? I did it, eventually. Things went so well for us...until I questioned my own commitment to her. I powered through it the best I could. Nonetheless, I stayed sober. Eventually, though...I slipped up, got drunk and cheated on her.

After that, I felt so guilty. I could hardly even talk to her. She had no clue what was going on, of course. It got to the point to where I just had to leave. I couldn't live with myself, having done that to the one person I wanted to spend my days with. I completely shut her out of my life. Dug my hole even deeper. Didn't even try to contact her for six whole months afterwards. She hated me, of course. I did tell her what really happened though...I miss her so much. I just want her again, and she's all I ever have wanted since I met her. She still hates me, it seems. How can I get her back?

24109,Infidelity,315dsv,"Lots of text here. Some backstory: My partner and I are polyamorous and we both have other loves. Things work out between us and the other folks usually, there is a lot of positive interaction. For the most part the other people in his life go out of their way to make me comfortable, and we sometimes share experiences together. The circumstances below are exceptions to our status quo.

During our year together we've been exclusively poly (never monogamous), usually with a lot of fun and success, but in December he cheated on me by continuing to have a physical relationship with someone who disrespected me on multiple occasions in his presence - he didn't jump to my defense in that situation, but did say later he would stop his physical relationship with her. Then he hooked up with her for a quickie in the bathroom at a party. When I got upset at this he agreed to stop physical contact. She later apologized to me and admitted trying to make me jealous and come between us. I talked to him again about my discomfort &amp; said that girl's convo with me was appreciated but felt manipulative and she still wigged me out, but it was okay for them to work on a respectful friendship. A few days later he slept with her again after withholding from me that he had planned to see her that weekend. To make things worse, they had anal sex, which I understood we only did with each other &amp; considered our biggest real boundary. (He didn't think it was a big deal for me, that my ass is his but other asses were just holes to him, and that he'd never have anal sex with other girls again.) 

After a few months of working this out and feeling pretty miserable, I think we're finally on the same page about that girl, but since his dislike of her came more after she later embarrassed him in public by bragging about their sex life to mutual friends, I'm not sure his stopping pursuit of her has much to do with my comfort. His reason for sleeping with her is that she is easy and he's taking advantage of that, and that it was just sex plain and simple, he'll deal with the fallout. (It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission ugh)

The butt dial thing is not about that girl but it comes on the heels of our issue with her so I think it is relevant as I am certainly still processing my current issues in light of that previous one.

There's another girl [23F] who I don't know very well but is social with the first. They are both very young, single, kind of transient folks. I met her at a party, we shared booze and hung out. They had met before but she didn't know he had a partner. Partner later said he was interested in a physical relationship with her and that they'd been making out during that party. I disclosed to Partner that I'd feel more comfortable with her if I got to know her a little better and if he'd take things slowly, vented a little, we argued into the night about this because he wanted to take his opportunity with her if he got it. Finally I got him to begrudgingly admit that he wouldn't pursue anything physical unless we laid some groundwork first. I want to make sure I am comfortable and she doesn't get hurt. He agreed, we went to sleep. I should also say we were both pretty drunk during this conversation, which I know isn't ideal, and it got pretty heated at one point.

The next morning he called me really early from work. I thought he was talking to me, so I listened. He was actually complaining to his buddy about how his old lady kept him up all night fighting like cats and dogs. Then he said about the other girl, Whatever man, I'm going to take advantage of those hot tits and tight ass and dive right in. I hung up there.

We've since talked about that conversation I overheard, and he said it was just guy talk, he wasn't being serious. I am having a hard time minimizing it like that. He also agreed with me on taking it slow with her so nobody gets hurt. I know the butt dial was not meant for me but it's still a thing he said and it makes me sound like a controlling jerk to his friend and sounds like he's not serious about committing to what he said to me. I can't get his words out of my mind. 

To make things worse I am older than these girls, not in the best shape of my life, and I can't stop internalizing that comment as a reflection of my own body. I've had dysmorphia issues in the past and can feel my disordered eating habits creeping back up. My own problem I know, but I can't stop thinking about it/comparing myself to these other girls, whose bodies seem more important than my comfort.

I know there's no easy answer to this problem and that the hard answer is that if I'm unhappy, I need to leave. Any thoughts on this situation and how to internalize it? I'd like to make this work but it's really tough to chew on all this negativity. I get all wrapped up in my own thoughts. He also travels a lot for work so I am sort of stuck processing this on my own or via telephone on work breaks.

If it helps, he does disclose all his actions fully and take responsibility for them and I do think he's trying to make things right. I wish I hadn't heard what I did. Thoughts?

I'm a college student currently in my third year and going to school about 450 miles away from home. While I was back in my hometown, I met this guy, we'll call him A. He was a complete stranger who I just started talking to and we clicked really well. We went on a couples of dates and determined that we both really liked each other and would see where it goes even though I had to leave and go back to college. We both stated that we were serious about each other when I left and called it a long distance relationship.

However, things went rocky after a few months and we broke it off. A told me that he loved me, but we could not be together because we both couldn't give each other what we needed and I agreed with him. He said that in the future we could possibly be together once I move back home, but that will be one year from now and I'm unsure how we would both change in that time. We ended on good terms and agreed that we could still be friends but I asked him to give me some space until I'm ready to be only friends.

The thing is that I'm still struggling with my feelings for him. I don't know how to let go and I'm having a hard time trying to get over it. It's been a few weeks but I'm still confused and I don't want to have lingering feelings once I start to be his friend again. I still want him to be in my life, but I'm unsure what to do because I'm not getting over it and coping as well as I thought I would.

I ultimately know that we will both date people in between the year that I'm still in college but I can't help but still want him in my life. I know that as long as I have these feelings for him, I can't talk to him.

But how do I get over him as a romantic partner when there's a chance we could be together in the future? How do you be friends with someone you love, knowing that you might be good for each other in one year but not now?

24113,Dating,3f2o19,"**tl;dr: Girl rejected me a year ago. We flirt and almost get off a couple of weeks ago. She was giving confusing signals the next morning.**


So I've known this girl for over a year now. We've both just left school. A couple of weeks ago we were staying at a friend's house (let's call him Rob) for a few days before she went off with her friend (let's call her Jane) and other friends (names unimportant) to travel around Europe and I went home.


A year ago I had asked her out a few weeks into knowing her after having engaged in flirtation with her primarily over text. She rejected me as she was head over heels into this other guy. Once she did enter into a relationship with said guy, he eventually became quite distant with her and she broke it off. During our time at my friend's house she did mention him a few times (mock) wistfully, perhaps frustratedly.


I was, of course, despondent and so maintained a distant friendship with her for most of our final school year.


At our friends house a couple of weeks ago we resumed our flirtation - this time in the real world rather than through texts.


In our conversations I mentioned a few times how I was single and how I hadn't actually fallen for anyone since her. At some point I remarked on another guy she had gotten off (not the one she rejected me over) with and she told me how he had, in effect, acted weird with her after having done the deed. She mentioned how his back massage she thought platonic, was in fact quite the opposite. I mentioned that back massages are never platonic between sexes.


**And here folks, is where it gets interesting.**


The last night at my friends house, we're watching a movie and she gives me this paltry back massage and says You owe me one. Later that night, brushing our teeth, I get all handsy and she reminds me of my... err... debt. I begin to make a move down her back and abdomen before


**HER FUCKING FRIEND (Jane) WALKS IN, OBLIVIOUS AND SLEEPY, SAYING THEY NEED TO GO TO BED.**


We take our hands off each other. It's kind of awkward for a few moments. She sort of stands there with her friend - I think she was expecting me to say something. Instead I sort of just smile and resign myself to my fate.


The next morning the girl, her damned friend (Jane), and I all head to the train station so that I can see them off before I make my own way home. They were going off with another group of friends. I'm feeling a bit frustrated but also a bit sickly - I think I had a bit of a stomach ache. Once we get a moment alone (her friend had gone off to buy something) I mention to her, in an admittedly slightly ill fashion, that we have unfinished business. In response, she just raises an eyebrow and smirks before commenting on the (still) sleepy and groggy friend of hers returning to us.

EDIT: More information I thought relevant. I hugged her goodbye at the station platform and said I'm not sure what happened last night but I'm sure we'll discuss it in a year and a half - which is roughly the amount of time before I begin see her again at university after my gap year. Her friends mildly laughed, knowing we had a flirtatious relationship but not knowing what went on. She had a bit of a flustered smile. I helped her bag up onto the train and she nicely bade goodbye.



Now she's known to be a bit of a flirt and get off with a few guys but she knows how I've felt about her. Another friend's told me she is just in it for the attention but I can't be sure (primarily because I'd rather she was in it for more than my attention).

24116,Dating,3hrct6,"Before dating, she and I talked about ideal partners and we matched up on pretty much everything. However, something she didn't mention then was that she really wanted someone creative and musical. She later told me that she didn't really realize how important it was to her. Half-way through our relationship, we started planning and dreaming about moving away to a new state together as we both had just graduated. The biggest motivator for moving was that there are just no jobs here for our respective fields. We both were incredibly happy!

When she started buying stuff for moving it kind of scared her a bit. She didn't really have as much money as she wanted saved up and didn't want to burden her parents as she got on her feet. To add to this, I later found out that her previous relationship before me hurt her a lot and she still felt broken. She told me that even though I've helped her so much, it's hard for her to let me love her because she feels broken, still dealing with some of her past and therefore guilty that she can't give me the same level I give her. It was scary to think about being separated from everything but me while she had this problem.

Still struggling with the pressure of moving and committing to us completely, she met a guy through an acquaintance of mine. He just so happened to play jazz piano, and she just so happened to be a beautiful jazz singer. Well they clicked instantly, and even though I felt a bit jealous of the sudden loss of attention. Next thing I know, they are texting constantly! Soon after, as she was in the shower I went to use her phone and their text messages were open when I unlocked it. I couldn't resist and read how they talked about what they look for in a partner, and how she felt so guilty to be accepting my commitment when she knew she couldn't offer the same so soon. He responded with stuff like 'don't tell me these things, it only encourages me'.

I apologized for looking through her private conversations, but asked her about it and she started crying told me that she knew it was wrong and that she hated herself for continuing like that but couldn't stop herself.

She is horribly guilty that she is putting me through so much pain, but we both understand it is important that she knows what she wants (regarding me v.s. someone else). Unfortunately, I can't stay in the area due to financial reasons, so we are under time constraints sadly.

In the end there were three issues she was struggling with:

1. Committing fully to me who is similar to her, but not exactly like her.
2. Moving away from her parents, while still not being fully dependent.
3. Career path issues.

The first issue is in regards to the jazz player. She told me it wasn't really about him, just that she had never met anyone exactly like herself before, and he made her question how things would be with someone else(musical). She told me that they are not talking for the month or so I have left here and that she will focus only on us and if she can figure out if what she wants is a future with me. (Which she says she can easily see as a happy future where she will be loved and taken care of).

The second is that she is nervous about moving out of her home and having to pay rent and rely on either me or her parents for a few months until she secures a steady pay check. I've told her I would be happy to help her with no expectations but she doesn't want to rely on others. Understandable.

The third is that she is not happy with her current job prospects regardless of area. She always dreamed of law school but isn't sure if she's cut out for it (her ex messed up her self-worth. I believe in her and encourage her to try). She gets disappointed when she sees that she can realistically only make ~40k a year, versus my 75k+.

**tl;dr**: She is struggling with three main issues, making her unsure whether or not to commit fully and move with me. I do NOT want to break up as I love this girl completely!

24120,Breakups,34zcim,"My girlfriend is a lovely person, genuinely nice, not to mention far too good looking for the likes of me and I very much care for her.  She absolutely adores me and worships the ground I walk on (in her words) to the point where I become slightly uncomfortable.  

However, partly due to being raised in a country undergoing a civil war and partly due to a very male dominated culture she has been massively sheltered growing up.  Any problem or issue has been sorted out by her well-meaning but paranoid father or her frankly emotionally abusive brother. She has only relatively recently begun to be able to make decisions for herself and spent the entirety of her undergraduate living with relatives.  
  
Despite being the same age there is a bit of a disparity between us in this regard, I've been living by my own means since I was 16 and have been homeless and am usually very content in my own company.  On the other hand it is only in the last 9 months she has moved away from these domineering and controlling family members. Additionally, our interests are a little divergent, I am an avid reader, with a fairly broad taste in films, TV and music. Whereas, she doesn't read all that much, and tends to prefer happier media that doesn't challenge her as much (in her own words).

I've done everything I can to try and encourage this independence and spend a lot of time helping her academically, personally and emotionally.  I purposefully avoid solving all her problems for her and talk her through ways of thinking about situations and resolving them for herself.   According to her I was a large factor in giving her the confidence to move away and start a masters degree.  There is a huge difference in her personal maturity and confidence now and when we started dating (although I hesitate to claim much credit for that).  We don't fight often but I do get frustrated when she doesn't stop and think things through before acting, this has improved a lot.

We have a very honest relationship and realised a year ago that there was no long-term future in our relationship due to very divergent life goals (she wants and/or is expected to get married and have kids).  She has tried to barter on this and had even agreed to forgo children if we were to get married but this was clearly not what she really wanted, when pushed she admitted to this.  It is not fair to make her throw away things like that for the sake of the likes of me.

Anyway, the upshot of this is 9 months or so ago we agreed that we would enjoy it while it lasted and I made it clear that if something else was to come along (either actively or passively) for her all she needed to do was let me know and we could amicably part ways no hard feelings kind of thing.   

Due to her having a naturally more active sex-drive, having men throwing themselves at her, as well as me being physically unavailable due to both distance and my work-load finishing up my PhD, she asked me the other day if she could go on a date with someone.  
My initial reaction was of course, if that is what you want to do, no hard feelings, I don't know how comfortable I am about an open relationship and it seems we may as well break up.  It wasn't a no you can't or I'll dump you but more measured and reasoned discussion about the state of our relationship (especially in light of previous enjoy it while it lasts discussions). 
However, she was utterly devastated at this prospect, floods of tears, terrified of losing me because she loves me and that I am her entire emotional support network.  I would miss her but I'm also pretty content, and used to, being by myself (not that I am a misanthropic loner, I have many close friends but largely we are all fairly fiercely independent people).

She is also in the middle of a personally fraught period between a natural disaster in her home country and desperately trying to find a PhD or technician job in science to do what she loves and to maintain her independence from family control.  I was concerned that the timing of this break-up, if she feels so reliant on me, could harm the last 2 years of independence she has gained and drive her back into the control of her brother and/or father.  Not to mention potentially fucking up her future career by yanking the carpet out from under her while she is already reeling and in the midst of a very important stage. While, I do acknowledge maybe loss of support network might be the best thing for her to further mature and become independent, it doesn't seem that right now is the best time to take that risk.
So we agreed, she wouldn't see this person and we would stay together but would revisit breaking up when things were more stable for her.

However, it occurred to me a few hours later that if the reason we were staying together was because it was best thing for her, then it was selfish and counter-intuitive to prevent her exploring sexually in a safe manner with our relationship as emotional support/background if/when it is needed.  It could also potentially allow her to transition without downtime between relationships if something else took off.
So I figure, this sort of open transitional relationship is what is best for her in both the long and short-term.  She happily agreed with this.

Despite rationally this being the best thing for her, I now honestly don't know how I now feel about the situation.  I'm not very interested in pursuing anyone else.  I'm also slightly worried from the outside it looks like I'm being used by her or that she is a bad person when everything has been my suggestion.  

TL;DR Having a transitional break-up, made the utilitarian decision but no longer sure how I feel about it.

24124,Dating,33unwg,"So I'm getting divorced and I live in a 3 bedroom apartment with my daughter (4 years old) half of the time, by myself the other half of the time (joint custody).  Recently the babysitter we have used for many years who is basically a family friend at this point needed a place to live for a few months and I offered our extra bedroom.  It seemed like a great idea at the time because she would be able to give free childcare services in exchange for free rent.  She and my daughter have an amazing chemistry and are really good buddies, it seemed like a no-brainer.

Fast forward a few months.  Babysitter/family friend and I are getting along really, really well -- we're becoming really good friends, and I'm trying hard not to think about her in a sexual way but increasingly failing.  She's has an incredibly hot body and always talks about sex.  Despite the 14 year age difference, she's much more mature than I realized and knows a lot of things about life that I am only just learning.  She's basically a lot more beautiful than I ever knew, and we have a lot of amazing and fun times hanging out (we've even taken some trips together -- her, me, and my daughter).  I didn't really notice/know/think about any of this before she moved in because we hadn't really ever hung out that much without my kid or ex wife around.  I would not have offered her a place to stay if I had the hots for her to start with, that would have been manipulative and shitty.  This whole thing just gradually happened.

She is leaving in a week to go to Italy for the summer, or possibly longer, so the tension will hopefully be averted then.  I broached the subject to her a few days ago because I just couldn't stand it anymore, but I made sure to be clear that I don't actually want to date her nor do I think it's a good idea to do so, I was just having feelings I couldn't really help having.  She seemed okay with this and agreed that we shouldn't even be thinking about dating.  Things haven't really been too awkward since then, the air seems a bit cleared.

There are so many reasons why it would make no sense for us to date -- huge age difference, she travels a lot and lives an itinerant lifestyle while I have a steady job and career, it would jeopardize the relationship she has with my daughter.  Also I'm getting over a 14 year marriage so I'm not exactly in a good head space right now to make sound judgments about relationships.  As is evidenced by this whole messy thing.

Anyway, so first of all, does anyone have any general advice on this situation, especially on how I can keep my shit together for the next week?

Our first date was awesome. He took me to a really nice restaurant and we took a long walk afterwards back to my place. At the end, he planted the world's most awesome kiss on my lips. Seriously, best kiss ever.

But after that, he has not even touched me. After dates, he usually just hugs me and says goodbye. When I'm over at his place to watch a movie, which has always been the universal signal for getting down and dirty, he actually watches the movie. He'll make something really good to eat, and he'll sit on his single person sofa and I sit on the other one. I've never spent the night there. He cancels out any opportunity for physical contact. I can't seem to get close to him.

Now, I'm painfully shy when it comes to stuff like this and I have no idea what to say to him. But, very honestly, to put it brutally, I want to fuck him. The memory of that awesome kiss is still etched in my mind. He's got a great body, he's really good looking, and is a damn nice person. He's even introduced me as his girlfriend to his friends.

24143,Dating,1y39wv,"tl;dr version: We clicked almost immediately, but she had a boyfriend and I knew that it would be best to just remain friends. She offered to get me chocolates for valentines this year, I refused her, but the more I dwell on it the more my feelings towards her are getting stirred up. (Some questions at the bottom from me to you)

Sorry if it might be a bit of a ramble, and I may end up missing bits out, I'm ill and doped up on emotions. 

My friend (let's call her Liz) and I clicked immediately, however she was/still is in a relationship so I tried not to thing of her as anything more than a friend, and we talk constantly both in person and over text/Facebook with our conversations usually ending with Good Night. Over the last 6 months or so, Liz has been generally more...touchy (?) than before, from little things such as squeezing closer on the benches in lectures, to full out trying to tickle me on occasions. She has also been more playful, such as kicking me under the table, trying to draw on me, taking my hoddies etc. I would do these things back, however I am aware she has a boyfriend, and so I try to ignore such things and I just put it down to her feeling comfortable around me.

Liz wanted to get me chocolates for Valentines Day. At first I was ok with it, thinking she would be getting them for her other close friends, however she then said she would only be getting them for me, her boyfriend, and her mom. I told her I wasn't comfortable with this and asked her not to get me the chocolates. But since then I have started to see her in a different light. I've never been in a relationship (asked out a few girls, but never felt more than friends with most girls I've met) and the thought of being able to spend V-day with someone who was so close to me...I just feel like a douchebag even typing this...it would have been amazing just to spend time with her, just the two of us, nothing sexual, just you know, not feeling lonely.

One of my friends (lets call him George) had a friend, let's call her Emily. When Emily found out that George liked this other girl, she did all she could to push them together. After a few months, however George and the girl started arguing and Emily gave George a lot of support and advice, however the girl eventually broke up with George. It was then that George realised that Emily was actually always there for him and asked her out and now they are in a happy relationship.

I spoke to Emily about my situation, and she has been encouraging me to pursue my feelings towards Liz as she can relate to how I feel, however I really don't want to lose Liz as a friend. Not only do I think it's just wrong to ask tell her how I feel while she's in a relatively happy relationship, I don't want to find out that she doesn't see me as more than a friend and breach her trust by making her feel like the last year and half was just me trying to get in her pants. 

I tried distancing myself from her, however due to the fact that we share all of our classes she ends up by my side and I have noticed that walking ahead of our group of friends doesn't work either as she just catches up with me, leaving the others behind.

About 2 weeks before we ended she was talking to me less and less and seemed interested in other people. We used to share a lot of love but it just faded out of nowhere.

He's been out of town for three weeks now, and has another five before he comes back (travel for fun, won't be too specific cause he's on reddit. He's not out there though, this isn't like a backpacking trip, he'll be in a city the whole time with phone reception/internet access. He also has his own place to stay that's private, he's not doing a room-share or something or like staying on a relative's couch). 



So this whole time we've been sexting a lot and sending each other naked/semi-naked/suggestive pics. After this last pic exchange I texted saying he should call me the next time he masturbates (never done it before but thinking phone sex could be kinda fun, didn't explicitly say LET'S HAVE PHONE SEX but I think that kinda gets the point across no?). Since then I haven't heard anything from him, I think it's been 3-4 days, when usually we communicate daily (sometimes multiple times throughout the day). 



I'm thinking there's a couple of possibilities here: he could just be teasing me/making me wait, OR he could be uncomfortable/not down with the idea but doesn't know how to express that. If it's the latter (which is kind of what I'm thinking...?), how do I proceed from here? Should I just wait a few more days and text him something explicit/another picture/just pretend everything is normal and ignore the fact that I ever made the phone sex suggestion? Should I wait it out for him to contact me? Should I ask him about it directly? He'll be back in town *eventually*, but I kinda don't wanna wait another month to have contact. ;-p



I know this is kind of a trivial question (especially after typing it all out...jeeze) but I'd really appreciate any feedback or advice on how to proceed, I'm worried that maybe I fucked up somehow (?) and would like to maintain as much tact as possible moving forward. 



I also don't want to come off as being clingy either, since we are just FWBs.

24162,Breakups,2gepbk,"I was broken up with a little over a month ago. I had been seeing this girl since January (7 months), and things were going really well the entire time. We have a ridiculous amount in common, never argued about anything, spent a fairly decent amount of time together, and were both really happy the whole time. She took a month long vacation abroad with one of her friends in July. We maintained some contact, but only a few texts now and again. She came back in August, we went on an overnight trip the next week, and while we were there she told me that she wanted to end it.

I was, and still am a bit confused. Since the breakup we've met up and talked about our relationship and what's happened a couple times. The breakup was on very friendly terms, and I think I can say I impressed us both with how calm and level-headed I was about the whole ordeal. She never gave me a clear reason for wanting to end things, but it effectively came down to her not being able to love me in the same way. I had told her a little bit before she went on vacation that I loved her. At the time she told me that she almost felt the same way, but wasn't quite there. A bit of a red flag I suppose, but I figured she'd get there in time, and she thought that too. In between that ordeal, and when she left we had a really nice couple of weeks spending time together, and our relationship felt even stronger, although we didn't talk about 'love' at all. 

This relationship was great, for the most part. We were into a lot of the same stuff, and both enjoyed doing the same things. We were both one another's firsts, and never really had any relationships prior to this, so it felt too-good to be true to some extent. This is a girl I've liked for the last year and a half, and was overjoyed that she was was also interested in me. She truly made me want to be a better person, and inspired me to make a lot of positive changes in my life. A fact that she is well aware of. We have a lot of common friends, both play music together in different groups, now work together, share the same common values, etc. There was basically no drama the entire time. In other words, there was a ton of chemistry, and now she seems to think there’s nothing more.

According to her, while she was on vacation, her friend mentioned pretty consistently that she missed her boyfriend, and my ex felt bad that she didn't necessarily feel the same way. While that's not the most pleasant message to have relayed to me, I figure it may be because that other couple had been together for a couple years and were noticeably very in-love with one another. My ex effectively said that she didn't feel like she missed anything, which seemed to imply her family and friends. In other words, she was having a good time and wasn't thinking about being home very much. I can't say it would be much different for me. It was that month abroad where she took a step back and evaluated how our relationship was going. She decided that I wasn't the kind of person she could see herself really loving, and that she wasn't ready to begin thinking about marriage, children, etc. To be fair, I wasn't ready for that nonsense anyway. I was pretty content with where things were, but I suppose was hoping, at the very least, that she would be able to love me back. I didn’t think I was asking much of her at the time.

I know she didn't cheat on me or anything quite like that. She told me it's not that she was bored. And she told me that now she's not really interested in dating anyone for a long time. Maybe a relationship isn't something she's interested in at this point in her life. That being said, for the two of us to be together for over half a year, I'd imagine she would have faced those issues at one point and decided that she was still into being together. She effectively gave me the It's not you, it's me argument, which I contend is bullshit. She didn't tell me any specific reasons why she was no longer interested, but said that she didn't want to lead us to a place where it would be harder to call off our relationship when she still didn't quite love me. 

Both times since the breakup that we've talked, I've spoken at length about how there was a lot of potential for us, and that working on problems together would reinforce the relationship. I told her that communication was key and that I could, and would help her get through whatever she was feeling. I told her I couldn't possibly blame her or be upset with her decision since it came from a place of concern and care. Ultimately, I was real nice about it all. Although modesty is one of my strongest qualities, (often to the point of self-deprecation), I'd like to think that I've got quite a bit going for me. I'd also like to think that her reasons for ending the relationship are therefore not just shallowness masked in pseudo-care and concern. I think her motivation is honest.

When I talked to her last, (about a week ago), we decided that it would be best if neither of us communicated with one another for a while, mostly so that I could really get over her. My spiel when we spoke was essentially Are you sure you want to call it quits? Alright, then let's avoid each other so I can get over you. Although we work at the same office and walk past each other/have to send business emails to one another occasionally, we don't speak or really make eye-contact...which sucks. One of the basic elements of our relationship was a strong foundation of friendship where we had a lot of common interests and felt very comfortable around one another, so abandoning that really blows and still doesn’t feel quite right. 

Throughout this entire experience I've tried to think about this a bunch of different ways and approach it from different angles. Sometimes it’s “I don’t need her, I can move on and meet other people who make me feel the same way,” and sometimes it’s “She screwed me over, I don’t need her,” (although I’d never let her know that), but more often it’s “Man, she’s definitely going to be the ‘one who got away’ I wish I could do something.” We had a few issues in the relationship that our talks helped point out. I was jealous of her friends who often spent a lot of time with her. She wasn’t very good at telling me what she wanted. We were both somewhat immature in that we’d try and avoid showing that we cared to seem cool (albeit usually subconsciously). I generally gave a lot and she didn’t always reciprocate or seem to care very much. Ultimately though, those are things I feel lots of successful relationships face, and simply by identifying them, it could be easy to work them out and make the relationship stronger.

Something hit me like a ton of bricks just the other day. I'm almost certain, that whether she knows it or not, the main problem in our relationship probably stemmed from the fact that neither of us really wore the pants and that we were both very timid about a lot of stuff. Although not every relationship needs this kind of thing, she was often indecisive and looked to me for guidance (although I didn't always see it that way), and I'd always just let her do her thing. I was always very conscious about giving her space and not being needy at all. In doing so, I often forced her to make a lot of decisions so that I wouldn't make her unhappy with my potentially wrong decision. I'm sure it all boils down to my lack of self-confidence, and my general demeanor which tends to favor pleasing everyone and assigning little merit to my own opinions and choices. However, I feel like if I had known that this issue existed, I could have assumed that role easily without making her feel second-rate. I wanted her to communicate any problems with me, and throughout the relationship invited her to talk with me about whatever she was feeling. But how do you comfortably ask your partner to be more decisive and be more confident? Maybe she wasn’t fully aware, or maybe she didn’t think it her place to ask, but I imagine that played a large part. I've always sort of been a natural leader in my family and among my peers, but I really respected her, valued her opinion, and let her make a lot of decisions, even if it wasn't quite what she wanted. I was perhaps too indecisive which I know now to be an unattractive quality. I feel like given the chance now, and knowing what I do at this point, I could fill that role more easily, and be less timid about my decision making. This isn't to say that I made no decisions and was a complete pushover. There is some middle-ground between respecting the other person's ideas/wishes/input, and leading decisions in a relationship, and I fear that I may not have found the right combination. This also isn’t to say that I can just overcome my self-confidence issues and become the leader in the relationship. However, having identified the problem, it feels like it might be much easier to work on fixing. At the very least, I’ve learned a lot for potential future relationships and can now identify some potential pitfalls.

I've surely bothered her enough by talking to her about our relationship and how I still feel really strongly about her. I imagine she doesn’t want to hear it at this point even though she seemed distraught at the thought of hurting me and leaving me every time. But I want to make it work, and I'm fairly certain that by assuming a more leading role in the relationship, I could have really helped her get to a place where she felt she might actually love me. By being apart, I'm trying to get over her and move on. I don't talk/text her, I don't follow her or her friends on social media. But I think about her day-in and day-out. I know that this breakup is relatively fresh, and I harbor thoughts about her that aren't permanent, but it just doesn't seem that way now. She's so wonderful, that I really can't stand not being with her. I want to believe I’ll get over this in time, but I’m not sure I completely can.

24163,Breakups,2hezoz,"I'm a 22 year old male and it looks like my 7 year relationship with my girlfriend is done. The long story made short is that inevitably due to the stages of life we were together we became different people and friends rather than lovers.

My girlfriend also had a very large personal tragedy which affected her massively three years ago. I guess after it happened I just went into support mode, then coping mode and I guess our relationship never fully recovered. There's been times of extreme happiness and extreme sadness but we always found a way. And then I guess slowly over the past year we just became friends more than lovers. I don't need an enormous amount as a boyfriend (potentially she'd beg to differ), but I do need to feel like I'm loved and wanted. Sadly, I haven't felt that way in a long time. A standard night with my girlfriend became going to her place, having dinner, talking about her day and her admittedly often large problems, her having a shower and then going straight to sleep early. I love her and always will, but I guess over a very long period I realised I need more than that.

As a result I started being lazy and this is in no way only due to her. I can't remember the last time I bought her a bunch of flowers or the last time she put on some nice underwear or something for me. I can't remember the last time I had sex outside of a bed (might not seem like a big deal, but if you only ever do the same thing it quickly becomes tiresome). Sex was always a big part of our relationship at the beginning and for the last year it's become less and less, which inevitably meant when we did have it it became shitter and shitter. If I had to summarise, I think I'd say there was and is too much going on in my girlfriend's life for her to properly love me.

So we broke up, it's been absolutely awful and this is where my title comes in. Breaking up as a bloke SUCKS. Off the top of my head she must have twenty different people (all female) she could talk at length about this to, I know she will get over me quickly enough (at least to a big enough extent that she can get along with her life and look to start other relationships). I have no one. She was that person. My guy friends won't give me more than a pat on the back and wouldn't begin to understand. I lost touch with most of my female friends before the relationship as is inevitable I guess, my girlfriend never really liked me having other close female friends both conciously and subconciously.

Any female friends I did have were hers too, and will naturally support her (I'm not annoyed by this, I understand). Maybe I'll be the bad guy and maybe that's fine if it helps her. It will be a couple of weeks and they'll be taking her out to clubs to help her move on, and she will, quickly as she's attractive and has plenty of options.

I'm not even sure how I will begin to cope with her being with someone else. This isn't some juvenile jealousy, we we each other's first and have never been with anyone else. Again, she has this whole support network around her that would help her through it if I get into another relationship, I have no one.

I guess I kind of lost a lover a little while ago, but now I'm losing my best and one true friend, the only person in the world who actually knows me, a family I love and saw myself as a part of and a complete lifestyle that I'd developed with her. I don't even know where to begin, so far I've just dived into work but have struggled some days with that. What should I do?

Here's the catch: Her roommate won't be there, so we'll have to figure out a different way to communicate.  Is this going to be a painfully awkward night, or is it going to be like a movie where we communicate on a completely different level? (who needs language anyways?) 

I've already decided to go through with it, because I'm not a fucking flake (and she's pretty hot).  Any recommendations on how to go about this date?  Any Spanish phrases that I should learn?

Edit: Oh and I should probably mention that it is going to be an activity-driven date, so it's not just going to be us staring at each other from across a table in silence.

24166,Breakups,37k971,"So this starts basically the second semester of my freshman year - there was this girl in my dorm who I had seen around but didn't really talk to the first semester, and then we started to hang out the second. One thing led to another, and we started dating. It was a really great time for me and I was really happy with her. Unfortunately, she didn't feel the same way apparently. This stemmed from a 3-year relationship she had previously had, and he hurt her really badly. Once she started dating me, she started having dreams about him that she claimed were changing the way she saw me.

So, about a month and a half into the relationship, she breaks up with me, claiming that she wasn't ready for another relationship and that he was still affecting her. She made it clear that it wasn't something I had done. I was crushed by this. I had had a two-year relationship in high school before, and I felt nothing when I broke up then. It was sort of the first time I had ever really cared about a person this much, and it just hurt me a lot. It's been probably a month and a half since. I have talked to her a few times and sort of cleared the air with her, and at this point I'm mostly over it - I was never mad, I understood her reasoning and believed she really wasn't ready for a relationship.

A few days ago I was surfing Twitter when I saw a tweet of hers that said, it's tough being in a relationship when you love someone else. The next tweets in a row went on to reveal she is now dating someone just a little over a month since the breakup. Not only that, this person has the same name as the guys' RA in our dorm and I had seen her entering his room (my room was basically right across from his) which leads me to believe that's who it is.

I'm still not so sure if I'm upset about it, but it just makes me mad for a few reasons. 
1. She felt that she couldn't tell me the truth. If it was something wrong with me, tell me it's something wrong with me.
2. I just feel betrayed. When you claim you're not ready for a relationship, I expect you to not be in an established relationship a month after the fact, which also makes me think this had been going on previously. I know that I shouldn't be thinking about her, but it just makes me really fucking mad. I really wanted to be friends, but I don't think I can any more.

24172,Dating,347lgl,"So I met this girl a few weeks back as a blind date a friend of mine hooked me up with at prom for a different school.  She was all over me for most of the night and I thought we hit it off pretty well for complete strangers.  I am not the type of guy to sleep around, so no magic happened at the end of the night.  When we left, it was like 4 in the morning and I was kind of drunk, so being a dumbass I don't remember to get her phone number.

Anyways, fast forward a couple days and I've been talking to her on Facebook a little bit.  There's no one else I know that I'm particularly into at the moment, and I had a good time with her at her prom, so I figured I would return the favor.  She couldn't go because of some conflict, but she said that it would be nice if we could go out some time.  I start to make plans for last weekend, but find out she had to go for a trip with her school that weekend so it doesn't pan out.  I tell her that it's all good.

At this point I'm figuring that I've got it made.  I know that none of her conflicts are BS from a friend of mine who knows her, and I know she's into me.  As I said earlier, her prom was the first time I have ever met this girl; I've gotten into hot water before for coming on too strong, so I decide I'll just let her sit for a few days and talk to her when she gets back from her trip.

On Monday I asked her how her trip went just as an icebreaker for hopefully scheduling a date with her for the weekend.  Still haven't heard anything back from her, which is never a good sign.  I am pretty sure where I fucked up is just letting her sit for 5 days without hearing from me, so now she thinks I'm a flake/not interested in her.

So, fellow redditors, is there anything I can do to fix this at this point or is it a lost cause?  Thanks for y'all's help.

24173,Breakups,3an1qu,"So I'm doing this on mobile, but I really felt I needed to post this.


Last Monday I received a call from my partner out of the blue. I'm sorry. I need to figure myself out. You did nothing wrong.
I was crushed. We were engaged. Our life was set. Everything was great. And in the blink of an eye, I was alone, hurt, and struggling to find some sense of understanding.



You're young, they said. You have a bit of college left, enjoy your freedom. I didn't want freedom. I wanted my partner. I cried, I pleaded with a higher power, I demanded answers, until slowly, painfully and gradually, I accepted the silence that I received for my efforts.



My partner was amazing. A little overbearing at times, a tad aggressive, causing me to take a more passive role when I'd like to be assertive and have a strong presence. But they were passionate, loving, kind, brave, creative, beautiful. And we loved each other more than the world.



It hurts like hell. No one ever said it wouldn't. But I think I'm beginning to realize that your heart really tries to make something right, when maybe you should be asking if it actually was. You cling to things that were practiced, were comfortable, had become easy and not awkward, where anything could be said and any tears could be let loose and you knew that in spite of the brutality of the world, you had a hand to hold.



That doesn't make it right. That doesn't mean they were the one. I was told by a friend (who was told by a friend,) if you think THAT was the end-all and be-all, just imagine when you actually meet them.



And I think they're right. The fact that you loved this person SO much, would do anything for them, go anywhere, change anything... and they weren't right for you. It wasn't meant to be. Just imagine.



Most importantly, I'm seeing the importance of being you. When you spend your teenage years with someone, they become part of your identity. When they are ripped away, you have to figure out how to fill that puzzle piece correctly- how to be you, and use the pain and massive change as an opportunity to become who you really want to be, redefine yourself in a way that you know that once the investment has reached fruition, this current broken you would be proud and even grateful for the person you could become because of it.

Okay so my Girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6.5 years (since we were 16). The early days were fun, but recently she has been working full time and I go to university from september to april so things got kind of stale. In about June this year I noticed a rapid change in her attitude toward me and our relationship. I seemed like a burden and she had little interest in having conversations with me and was becoming noticeably distant. In July we had a hard conversation where she basically said that I wasn't emotionally stimulating enough (wasn't being affectionate enough) and we agreed to work on it. After this, communication immediately started to break down - she wasn't interested in  having conversations, I couldn't get her to laugh, and she barely acknowledged my presence.  This all came to a head 2 weeks ago when we went camping for my birthday with 2 other couples. It was a brutal weekend, I felt like crap. I had been trying to communicate with her the whole time but I was getting shut out and only getting one word or sarcastic answers. 


When we returned home, 2 days later she said we needed to talk, which ended up being her breaking up with me. I remained level-headed and asked her why (which she said I wasn't being affectionate enough), and that we both needed to figure out what we wanted in life and being on our own was probably the best way to do it. I asked if she was willing to consider being 100% open and trying to work through it as the relationship was long and I felt we owed it to each other and ourselves to work at it - to which she said no, she was set on breaking up. I also asked If anyone had influenced her decision which she said no. Lastly, I asked if she wanted to keep in touch and she said that it would be better if we didn't talk for a while. 

The next day I felt like crap, but I hung out with my highschool buddies who I haven't seen very much because they are all in the service industry and party a bit too hard for my taste. It was like not a single day had passed and they treated me like old times, and it felt awesome. Basically the whole crew was at my best friends for a party and we had a blast. The following days after work we would all meet up and go for beers, go to a movie, or just hang out. I noticed a night and day difference in how I socialized and my motivation. I got more shopping and errands done in 5 days than I had in the last month, pressured by my own desire to fit in and be normal. 


I was pretty much over the relationship. I still though about my girlfriend but I was so focused on going forward that it didn't really bother me. When I was out at a pub with my buddies I got a text from her asking if we could talk. This was 6 days after we broke up. 


The next day (today) we met and she said how she had made a huge mistake and wanted to get back together. She confessed that her friends who are perpetually single advised her to break it off with me, which I had asked about and she had lied. She said how she had been crying every day since we broke up and she gave me a long letter expressing how she had messed up by breaking up with me.



My dilemma is this: I still love her, she is a total sweetheart, she is beautiful, we laugh(ed) together like no one has made me laugh, and she cares about me more than anyone. The hardest thing about breaking up with her would be knowing how shitty she felt. However, we have little in common; we have totally different life plans (family vs career), differences on things like marriage and kids, and we don't have much intellectually in common. Also, the last week of me being single I have been a totally different person - a person who I want to be for good - and I fear that if I got back to my old ways I will eventually slip into the boring, antisocial, unmotivated person I was before.

I happened to meet a dutch guy who was studying at the same university and I fell in love with him.  Looking back, I'd even go so far as to say he changed what I wanted to do with my life. He put everything into perspective, he made me feel alive. I have never been so happy since, even though I know it is only chemicals in my brain. We were together for about six months. Then we both had to return to our countries to complete our senior years.

    


I felt like I didn't care what I did, so long as I was with him. We kept in touch through email and googlechat, talking every day. I assumed we would meet up again after my graduation. But then I noticed after several months his messages became less frequent and he wasn't coming online to chat. I knew this must mean he didn't feel the same way as me anymore. And I know you can't expect young people to be tied down to one person. But I loved him so I hung on. After two months of silence from him I sent him an email where I said what I felt and that I wanted to be with him. He replied that it was a bad time for him as he was working and he couldn't see how we could be together as we are from different countries. I later learned through mutual friends that he had met someone new in Rotterdam.

I badly want to see him again, because I love him. But he broke my heart and I feel angry that he can come to me after all  this time and say things like that and expect me to feel the same.

And, it seemed like it was helping… However, I sit here two months later struggling with the same (worse) breakup questions/anxieties/what ifs that I had in the immediate aftermath. I’d be interested in reddit’s thoughts on how to advance through this breakup (and affirmation that my ‘what ifs’ are/aren’t possible).


Additional detail:


Since going through the breakup, my perspective has significantly changed on what/how I am looking for a partner—from an aversion to the thought of anything serious (product of a broken marriage) to a desire to find my best friend/life partner and a willingness to make sacrifices— I must also honestly say that the/any relationship would have ended (LDR or not) at some point due to my views on relationships at the (pre-breakup) time, a view that I only gained by going through this breakup process—nice catch-22. It sucks to acknowledge after the fact, but my ex would have made a great partner in those respects (best friend, fun, very attractive, similar whit/intellectual connection, etc) and I’m concerned that I may not be able to find someone similarly great. 


The what-if’s that I am pondering are thus tied to my willingness to make necessary sacrifices to really make that relationship work (take the leap). It would have required a bit of a career change (a unique and fun O&amp;G role in Houston to a partially related finance gig in manhattan). Why didn’t I do or suggest so (before or after the breakup)? Her family could have helped me out (a “NY family”) and I have come to enjoy Manhattan—the latter, another delayed realization which was not conveyed to her. Should I express it to her now? Is it too late to change? Do I really want to make such change? Etc.  {feedback appreciated}


Finally, it may be important to note the manner of communication during/after the breakup… I was broken up with on the phone 1-week prior to a scheduled visit with the expressed reason as our relationship had “fizzled” (maybe not the only reason, but a reason that I myself had felt during past times where I debated ending it). Conversation was brief (I was very surprised, didn’t know how I felt), and I likely came across as someone who similarly felt the lack of “fizz.” A few courtesy texts were exchanged in the first week and we had a brief/awkward conversation 1 month out (seemed like it was hard on both, desire to get back together was not expressed/discussed by either). Otherwise, it’s been NC as formally requested by me.


Any thoughts/advice? I’ve never been hit by a breakup to nearly this extent before.

We met on CoffeeMeetsBagel and she was very close to the type of person I look for. Smart, kind, sense of humor, sense of adventure, kind of a dork. And bonus: adorably pretty. We had a lot in common and got along so effortlessly it was hard not to have 2-3 conversations simultaneously. First date went well. We were both a bit sick so it was only a couple hours, and instead of the lunch we planned to have, we ended up Snapchatting our food to each other afterward. Cute, right? Next date was a few days later (movie date -- usually like to be more creative but she was going out of town soon and it was what was doable). It went just as well. Got along effortlessly, solid flirting going on. I end with a kiss. Went for a cheek and she went for lips, but shit happens and it was funny. She made a point of saying she enjoyed the date. Things continue humming along for a few days.

Then she stops responding. Not completely, but obviously. Hmm. I know this part, the soft rejection. I get it from everyone. Move on to the next one. But the transition this time has me puzzled. I give it a few days, then ask her what's been up lately. To her significant credit, she was directly honest and said she didn't want to lead me on since she didn't see this continuing. Welp. Doesn't make sense (in a what did I miss? way), but what can you do. Start to finish in ~3 weeks. Short as usual, but I cared more than average this time, so it stings. And it got me thinking.

#The problem

It's been six years of this, since my last real relationship ended in maddeningly similar fashion. Probably a few dozen of the above scenario repeating themselves like some irrational, mechanical clockwork. I'm pretty confident in myself, but it'd be arrogant to think the problem lies elsewhere. Even if it did, the only thing I have control over is myself.

***But***, how do you diagnose a problem when you don't see any specific symptoms? I don't expect dating to be a deterministic wonderland of push-this-button-for-success, but for fuck's sake shouldn't random chance throw me a bone every now and then? Even if someone wanted to help, I wouldn't have any idea where to begin for them. And it's not like I can send out a customer satisfaction survey for data. Where do I start?

#Background

That being the case, hopefully some background can be of use:

I try to use as many sources as possible for meeting people. CmB/OKC, through friends, work, chance encounters on the street. Although I try to avoid friends, since the one time I did that ended disastrously for everyone. I think I have a good sense for compatibility and I end up turning down more people than I pursue. The most significant relationships I've been in have all been initiated by the girl. I tend to have phases of putting a lot of time into dating alternating with putting zero time into it.

I've got an awesome, interesting job. Jack-of-all trades with hobbies. I'm the wittiest person you'll ever meet. In shape. Introvert, mostly because I need to recharge after being around people rather than not liking social interaction itself. Hate seeing people in pain. Fit the INTJ type pretty well. Don't know what else would be useful.

When our friends invited us for a get away last summer we both we excited.  We rented a cabin that was big enough for both couples.  On the last night my wife came to me and told me my friend made a pass at her.  She said she felt uncomfortable and violated.  She wanted me not to say anything and just leave early the next morning.  So we did.  

Over the next couple of weeks I noticed she was really withdrawn from the marriage and something seemed off.  We were not having sex and really not talking.  One night she suggested that I find a girl to have on the side, this was not super weird for us as we have brought a third in bed with us before.  I ask her if this meant she wanted a guy on the side, she said yes and when I asked her who she gave the name of my best friend.  I was in shock and freaked immediately.  Clearly she did not feel violated if she wanted to have a relations with him.  

The next day we had a serious talk and agreed we did not need to have outside partners.  But something was not right, over the next couple of months are relationship was rocky at best.  At our consoling sessions I asked her if there was something going on.  She denied and even broke into tears at one point describing how violated she felt when he made that pass at her.    

The summer ended and fall began our relationship starts to get better, but I have this feeling something happened that just will not leave.  My friend was acting weird as well he kept bringing up the cabin and complaining that we were not hanging out as much. So we invited them over a day later while my oldest daughter and I were playing with my wife's iPad I see a notification pop up.  It is an email from my friend, just a thanks for inviting us email.  Being a guy myself and knowing my friend I knew this was a fishing email trying to start a conversation.  Wife acted like she had no idea why he was emailing her.  It was weird but I chalked it up to my pervy friend being his usual over friendly self.  

A couple months pass and my wife and I are doing the best we have ever done our relationship is in a great place and we are really working together as a team.  Sex life is back and we both kicked the pot habit.  life was good.  My friend was texting me a lot asking for us to hang out.  So one day I met him at a bar and told him why things were awkward.  He acted like he did not remember anything but I could tell he was lying.  Something seemed off but I just did not know what.  

A couple of days before our family was headed out of town for thanksgiving, I got a text from my buddy saying there was more to the story.  I asked him to meet up but we could not before thanksgiving.  I told the wife about the text she acted like she had no idea what he was going to tell me.  

We are at her parents house for thanksgiving and having a great time.  My daughter and I were playing on the Ipad when I decide to look in her email account.  I check her deleted items, I see emails between her and my buddy, she was asking what he was going to say to me when we meet.  I was obivious something had happened.  I check the sent items and found a trove on emails from over the summer.  They where mostly getting to know you conversational with some talk about trying to meet up.  I can tell by the emails that the meet up never happened and they stopped communicating over the summer.  Seeing these emails hurt me to my core.  I was crushed.  reading the conversations broke my heart and my trust.  

Here is the problem I need help with, I do not know how to stop being paranoid, i want to check her email every second.   I want to read all of her texts and interrogate her every time I do not know where she is for 10 minutes.   At first I wanted a divorce but I just cant do that to my kids.  I love her and know she loves me, but how do I calm down?

24199,Breakups,2qlbhl,"My ex GF we will call her ,Bella (not real name) and I had been going out for 3 years. Throughout these years we had some amazing times and really grew extremely close. 

There were of course bumps in the road as per usual but one of the main things was my lack of drive. I failed many classes but promised many times that I will do better. 

Well College comes around and she tells me this is my last chance, that she loves me but me breaking my promise of doing better is really beginning to hurt her a lot. I buckle down and prepare to take on these classes that I know I can ace with some elbow grease. 

We are not having to many issues at this point my classes are going well and I really feel as if I am finally doing ebtter for myself and that she will be extremely happy with my progress. Well a month into the semester she breaks up with me.

She has always had some emotional issues with her parents being far from supportive or helping too her. She tells me that she can't feel anything and that she thinks we should break up. Of course I start to freak out and make matters worse.

After the initial break up day I begged and pleaded for her to come back, showing of my impressive grades (4.0 :) ). I know I pushed to hard here but I was in a bad place.

Fast forwarding a couple months, we still talk quite a bit. She always tells me how I am her favorite person in the entire world and blah blah blah. I recently asked her on a date after a months of not pressing myself on her. Well Bella says no, (I of course am confused and ask, why?). Bella says that I disrespected her when I kept asking for her back and I shouldve backed off when she said too. (I agree I definitely should have). 

So I am at a crossroads here, I love this young woman with every ounce of love I have in me. I just want to be by her side for an eternity. I never wanna see her hurt but I myself am constantly depressed and thinking about her. I told her recently how I may need to just stop talking with her because I am getting too depressed and can not stop emotionally breaking down over her. She is of course sad and upset that I do not want to be her friend. 

I really do want to be her friend. I just can't help wanting to be with Bella so God damn much. 

I am meeting up with her tomorrow to give her a gift I got her and her Ipod. I am planning on possibly saying goodbye (for a long time). She knows that this is coming, she says Why cant we just be friends, you mean so much to m... etc. 

I really have no idea what to do. I love her and I do not want to just stop being in her life, but I am to stuck. 

I don't know what to do. Do I stick around and watch as other guys try to make their moves (She says she doesn't want a relationship with anyone) or do I move on for myself and leave her behind.

PREVIOUS POST TL;DR: He had been camming/sexting with random women on the internet and even sexted/flirted with one woman he knew in real life. He trickle truthed for almost a year until I got the whole story a few months ago. We talked and talked and talked and finally decided to stay together and work on honesty and trust together. Things were going great (aren't they always?) until yesterday....

NOW:

As a part of rebuilding our trust, we agreed that he wouldn't speak to the real life woman he sexted with (which has been difficult since she works in his building), visit any the sites where he had previously met people online (gonewild, various cam sites), and that I would have free range to go through his phone, internet history, etc. I was keeping a close eye on him at first but slowly was backing off because I didn't want to be over his shoulder every minute as that's not healthy or how I want to live my life.

Well, I look through his internet history yesterday and whaddya know? He went to one of those cam sites!

(For those who don't know, most of these cam sites, you can comment and tip the cam girls, but it's mostly not interactive. However, you can pay for private videos and skype sessions).


He says he just goes there to view and sees it as regular porn. Even if I believe him, He PROMISED not to go there. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!! This is about the mildest infraction he could have committed, but STILL! I don't understand how or why he would do this! I told him over and over again that if he screwed up, in whatever way, the most important thing to me was that he be honest. That's the big fucking deal here. He just lies and lies and lies. He just can't be honest. Which is insane because he guilts me if I tell a white lie to get out of hanging out with someone I'm not fond of!

I love him so much and I don't want to break up but come on. I can't be with someone who consistently disrespects me. I was just looking at rooms for rent on craigslist and I feel like I want throw up. He's asking me to play video games and doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the situation. I need help and perspective. 


TL;DR: BF has been camming/sexting with internet randos on/off throughout our 4 years together. Got caught a few months back. Everything was getting better, I was starting to trust him again.

So the advice I was given was to reconnect with friends so I went back to my home town (cause I am away for uni) . 

The first night being single I spent most of the night driving home.

 Second I went out to play the pokies and have a few drinks with one of my old friends. 

Let's call him A. He's incredibly smart, funny and such a good person to be around. 

I had such a good time but when he dropped me off at home I hugged him goodbye and he cutely but awkwardly kissed my neck. 

I am very confused about A because when I got home I felt so happy which I feel guilty for.

 He also has girl problems himself. Which he was telling me about.

 So the next day I spent with my best friend 'S' he went to school with me we did drama together and got very close until I moved away. 

We spoke for ages and he was a good shoulder to cry on but then he started acting strange.

 We went swimming and then decided to go play poker (he didn't play) and the pokies. 

After he left he sent me a message saying he loved me. 

With all these adorable things about me he loved. 

He also mentioned he wanted to stab himself and I pretty much pushed him away because I don't really tolerate that sort of behaviour. 

He tries to talk to me but I feel like it would just have been better if i didn't know. It gives me a lot of stress that I don't need right now.

My ex boyfriend actually sort of suspected it. I'm obviously very stupid. 

I'm not over my ex yet, he's still in my dreams and on my mind. I can't even eat properly yet. I still love my ex even though he's not good for me. 

I feel free though like I was sired to him. Now that I have all this me time I don't know what to do with myself. 

Although I am feeling more confident in myself because he's not there putting me down.

 I also noticed I'm less insecure and I don't worry about much.

 I feel like a better or new person. But I'm not sure what to do about 'S' :( My ex ex ex boyfriend (my first love) added me on Facebook the other day and is supporting me. 

He cheated on me because I lived an hour away and he was bored but I forgive him.

 He's grown up heaps and I'm thankful to have all these people supporting me. :) 


Should I pretend everything is normal with my best friend? He wants me to but its hard. I told him I needed some space please help.

Me and my SO broke up a few weeks ago. She owns 3 cats. She asked me to take care of them until she got her own place. Because otherwise she would of have to get rid of them (noone but me can take care of them really). 


So I was like fine. I'll take care of them. However, I won't be your sorage  while you're out banging other dudes, dating etc. So if you plan on doing that, you have to take care of your own cats. 

I am not gonna do her this huge favor while shes out there moving on. While it's pritty much impossible for me to move on (Due to her cats reminding me of her. Also if I got a date home and they asked me about the cats Oh its my EX! Np ) 

I also said that incase I find out that she's been lying to me and been out fucking around. I'll get mad as fuck because she would be using me and incase that happend, I wouldnt be nice to her anymore and kick her cats out and demand she pays me back all the money shes owe me (Im letting her pay whatever she can atm). 


I also said that you can get them whenever you want, you can start dating and I wont be mad at you and you can still pay whatever you can on your debt. But if you force me to care of your cats while youre out dating.. Ill get mad. 


I've asked this on another forum and they bashed me saying Im only helping her out to force her NOT to move on.

24215,Breakups,1is2s4,"Alright, so those of you still hurting fresh, try to believe my words as much as possible. I know it's hard, but give it a read, you might feel better. :)

When you hear or see any glimpse of your ex right after your break up, it hurts. Like a bitch.

But over time, the pain really does ease. The blow still remains, but it gets smaller and smaller every time, and the time it takes to recover gets shorter and shorter. Despite NC, we are sometimes bound to hear/find out something we don't want to.

I just got sent a photo from a mutual friend of her and my ex both making funny/weird faces. It caught me a bit off guard. I don't even know if my ex knew it was being sent to me or whatever, but either way, it happened. At this point, I'm doing really well with my recovery. I feel like I'd be ready to date other women if I see someone who interests me. However, even seeing pictures of her, or seeing her in person still bothers me. BUT it's no longer in the sense of Ugh, why did she leave? or Why can't we be together? but more so, Get this bitch out of my face because I have better things to do.

And that mindset starts coming a lot sooner each time. I'm not lying. It's become more of an annoyance, a nuisance, more than anything else. I feel annoyed because I've finally come to the realization of how much I've bettered myself as a result of this break up, and she just seems to get in the way of it.

We were both at fault for the relationship's demise (as is the case in most), but I did admit to my mistakes, I admitted to my insecurities and where I was at fault, whereas she chose not to. That's fine, it's her arrogance/ignorance, and not my concern to deal with. I know what to fix for next time, when it matters. I don't care for her apology, nor do I care for her coming back. Seriously, /r/prettygirls reinstated my faith in female beauty when I thought I wouldn't find anyone more attractive than my ex. I made a huge realization a while ago. It was a realization that many had stated, but to believe it, it had to come from within myself. *I realized that I have a choice.*

Now, I can choose to dwell, or I can be a sexy bitch and move onto better things, better lifestyle, and better women. Since the break up, I've worked out every day, and constantly been on a healthy diet. I'm on the verge of looking photoshopped. I had a choice to splurge on comfort foods, but I promised myself that there was no fucking way that I would come out weaker from this. Whenever my parents left the house; at first, I would use that time to mope and cry. Now, I just rock out with some fucking Arctic Monkeys on my guitar. Before, I would cancel plans with friends to stay home. Now, I'm the one making plans to meet up with people. I'm going fucking skydiving in August. It'll be epic. There is no fucking way I will step back. Regression is not be an option. Why would I mope on someone who doesn't matter, only to end up missing the opportunity to meet someone who does?

I've noticed that I'm much more comfortable in being alone, whereas I used to get anxiety before. You know how many anxiety attacks I've gotten since the break up? None. FUCKING ZERO. How amazing is that? I had no friends in my city to rely on after the break up (which occurred during my god damn finals), but I not only survived, I got better. I've gotten so much more productive with my time. I have tons more money because now I'm not wasting spending hundreds of dollars on someone who would later go on and say she didn't care for it. My hair looks fantastic, and I recently bought a whole new wardrobe from my trip in NYC/Chicago because I decided it was time to reinvent.

I'm not trying to brag, I'm sharing my journey in hopes that it will inspire yours. I know what I've said seems hard to believe, for even I didn't believe them when I was fresh out of a break up. But over time, you do emerge the victor, as long as you make the best out of it. You have a choice. Easier said than done, I know. But work hard now so you can reap the profits later. Use this time to reinvent yourself, and just fucking kill it. Even if you feel you were at fault for the break up (which I highly doubt you were entirely responsible for), use this break up to improve those areas of your life. Use this time to develop your character, not degrade it. Don't let yourself become the villain of your own story. What your ex did to you is no longer relevant. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. You have a choice.

He kept telling me that he loved me, that this is the hardest thing he's ever had to do, and that if he had any doubts then he wouldn't be breaking up with me. The whole thing lasted about 5 minutes. I didn't beg or even fight really I guess. I just said okay.

I guess it just hurts because he told me during the break up that nothing I could tell him would make him change his mind. I'm going back and forth with feelings of sadness and anger.

He has taken the things I told him about myself &amp; used it against me such as calling me &amp; my family desert people b/c we're from Afghanistan.

We texted for a while, and soon met up on a trial date. It was really fun and S was sweet, so I, being dumb, was smitten but cautious. I was talking to another guy, but after meeting S, I stopped talking to him.

Not long after we began to hang out at my new apartment fairly often. Mostly we would watch TV/play video games and make out. Fun stuff. We never quite had sex, but there was plenty of heavy petting, nothing I wasn't comfortable with. Pretty soon, I figure out I have feelings for S, but I'm pretty shy and always got tongue tied when I tried to talk about it. I figured I made it pretty clear I was interested in him through actions. I even asked him out on another date, and he agreed, but we never got to go.

So last week he goes to A-Kon, sends me pictures of cosplayers, generally keeping in contact. I make it through the hell I work in with the hopes that S would back and want to hang out again. I spent all week building up the guts for this hey, would you be interested in a serious relationship talk. I thought we were pretty much already dating to begin with, but you gotta be clear about these things.

He gets back, but we don't immediately hang out because he works full time, too. I don't mind, I wait patiently for the opportunity, but try to keep a regular conversation going.

Yesterday, I get home, hop on Facebook to check a video another friend sent, and Bam! He has a relationship update with a girl he went the con with. Cue a few hours of dazed denial while I finish homework. I text him about it, hoping maybe it was a joke or something. 

Nope. He confirms that he does in fact have a girlfriend now. He apologizes to me, twice, and says he would still like to be friends. 

Now I feel used and dumb, because I really did like him. I don't get attracted, romantically or sexually, to people very often, but I was attracted to him. I've really liked someone like I liked S. I've never cried this much in my life. I'm stuck in the hell that is being a jealous bitch and desperately not wanting to be one. 

The worst part is I still want to see him. I don't want to never see him again. But at the same time, I can't stand the idea of just being friends, not when I've gotten so used to kissing and cuddling. Not when I still want to kiss and cuddle with him.

24227,Dating,33pybs,"I met a girl online, Heather, and had a great date with her a few weeks ago. She’s quiet and introverted, and I am too, so we're a good match. Last weekend, though, our 2nd date went awful. She’s from a different city, has a strong accent and uses unusual phrases, and all this combined with my poor hearing meant I found it hard to understand her. She got upset as she felt I wasn’t making any effort, and I could only marginally improve her mood before I dropped her home.

The next day, I texted her acknowledging that the date was bad, that I now knew what did not work and she could call me in a few days so I could get used to her accent, and maybe arrange another date. She didn’t reply. But later on FB, she posted a couple of statuses that appeared directed at me, although she didn’t write my name. One was a silly thing I had said the night before, the other her saying “Guys from &lt;my city&gt;, I don’t think you’re for me, I should get a restraining order!”

I was furious when I saw this; after all I didn’t intentionally hurt her and tried to make it right. If this was her way of saying “We shouldn’t meet again”, why didn’t she just say that to me instead of this very public method? Also, I think I’ve lost confidence after this. I thought that the last few months, I’ve been very confident, relaxed and indifferent, yet just seeing those FB posts has made me question and doubt myself these last few days.

If she’s just being a drama queen, reacting to a little temporary upset, then she might call me. How do I react? Do I laugh it off, which might make her respect me less, or do I confront her, and risk scaring her off for good? I was in a similar situation 2 years ago, took bad advice (to confront the girl) and messed everything up. Heather is the quieter girl so I have to be careful. Or should I just work on my self-confidence, and become TRULY non-reactive so stuff like this doesn’t bother me?

24239,Dating,2toy87,"Hi Reddit, 

I made a post about a month and a half ago detailing a similar predicament with the same girl, which was more complicated due to the fact she was seeing someone at the time. If you're curious here's the post: 

&amp;nbsp;

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2o0ojm/i_m19_have_gotten_really_close_with_a_girl_f19/

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short she's someone I've gotten to know over the last 9 months, we've become super close and I've had a crush on her since the first time we spoke way back in March of last year. The guy she was seeing ended up being a total dick and they're over, and I like to think I may have a shot if I tell her how I feel. 

&amp;nbsp;

There isn't anyone I'd rather spend my time with right now and luckily we seem to spend a lot of time together. We have plans to go to dinner this week (for my birthday) and are going to a local hockey game next week for hers. We hang out a bunch and watch movies, or grab coffee, or whatever - just things university students do when spending time together. And honestly I'm at my most happiest when these things are going on, I absolutely love talking to and being with this girl.

&amp;nbsp;

We each consider each other best friends, we trust each other completely and when she's upset or stressed she always comes to me which I love - the opportunity to help her out or cheer her up is one that I'm so thankful for. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was in a long term relationship throughout high school and haven't been with a girl since then (16 months or so), mostly because I wasn't ready and hadn't met the right one. This is the first girl I've ever met that I'd literally do anything for, I care about her so much and she's someone that deserves more than anything to be happy - and I really want to be the one to make that happen for her. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to tell her how I feel so badly but I'm absolutely terrified it'll screw up what we have going now. I'm unsure how she would take it, or whether or not she reciprocates the feelings, and I'm so worried that by saying something I could lose one of the best things I have going on in my life right now. At the same time I know it's going to drive me crazy if I don't say anything, it's been 9 months. 

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone have any experiences that they can relate to this? Some of my friends who know how I feel argue that we'd be able to work things out if it gets awkward or whatever but I don't know, the risk is just so scary to me right now. Any advice is appreciated!!

24241,Dating,2ag4fn,"When I first started dating my boyfriend, I found it a bit strange that he maintained such a close relationship with his ex-girlfriend (I guess more so because I'd dated men in the past who have really close friends that used to be exes and it always turned out badly). They post each other on their Facebook walls, they text each other a lot...it's just not the type of friendship I usually expect with two people who are exes. But my boyfriend had never had another girlfriend apart from me and his ex, and their relationship was pretty serious (3 or 4 years, if I remember correctly) so I tried to ignore it.

But then my boyfriend and I went on holiday. On the drive back, we were talking about past events that we had found we both attended (before we knew each other) and running through pictures of them. My boyfriend was scanning through pictures and he says, Aww..

I ask him what he's awing at, and he says he found a picture he had never seen before and flips his phone around at me for me to see it-- it was a picture of him and his ex-girlfriend, embracing each other and *kissing*.

I immediately looked away and straight ahead at the road. I was upset. He recognized that I was, realized that was probably a stupid thing to do to your current girlfriend, and apologized profusely. I just didn't understand why he had such a strange reaction to the picture. Keep in mind, the two of them haven't been together for 3 years, she has a boyfriend who she lives with, and he swears up and down he has no residual feelings for her.

Okay, so he was repentant. He realized it was a stupid thing to keep tight hold on, since we had just had a very lovely holiday together so I let it slide.

Fast forward to this morning, and he posts an article about his hometown (that I had just taken a very long tour of 2 weeks ago when I met his parents) being the setting for a new movie. In the status, he tagged his ex-girlfriend. Seeing it immediately sent this shock of pain through my chest, I can't explain it...

It's not that I'm afraid there might be feelings between them, I know he wouldn't have even started a relationship with me if that were the case. I just don't feel comfortable with the level of intimacy the two of them maintain and don't feel it's appropriate now that *I'm* supposed to be his girlfriend. Am I being ridiculous? How can I explain this to my boyfriend without making it seem like I don't trust him?

24245,Breakups,2r9aul,"Me and my ex had been together for around 3 years, we were good friends at first but soon were into a fairly serious relationship. All of this happened quite fast, maybe a little too fast to be honest.

From the very beginning it was clear there were some trust issues on her part, after discussing it with her it became apparent that this was mainly because her parents marriage had ended as a result of her fathers infidelity. This was both our first serious relationships and I was committed to treating her in a way which allowed her to lower these defences she had built around her.

It wasn't long into the relationship that the jealousy began to show, this could be caused by anything and anyone such as a particular sense of humour I have with an old friend of the opposite sex that my ex didn't get. At first, I thought it to be cute and did all I could to settle her worries but they seemed to jump from one girl to the next. It's important to note that I was not perfect on the jealousy front, however I always seemed to be able to deal with it better than her and deal with it without acting out.

I'd like to say that for the most part, this girl is sweet, kind, and very loving of friends, to the point where she would often put herself under unnecessary stress just to please people, she is also stunningly gorgeous. The problems come when she switches mood fairly quickly and often, this causes her to be near enough the opposite of the above. She, to be perfectly honest, can be a bit of a bitch when in one of these mood and acts as if she doesn't give a fuck about anything with perhaps the most frustrating part being how stubborn she gets.

Before we met she was reasonably well liked which I feel was due to her bubbly attitude making her fun to be around, however she had a lot of people that did not like her and vice versa. In more recent times on nights out where she had not been there, I felt like I was walking on egg shells, I have never given her any reason to be distrusting of me but according to her, it was the girls around me she did not trust. This is all well and good, but the inevitable phone call the next day would never be to ask how my night was and see if I had, had a good time, but rather to interrogate me about the girls I was with, how intoxicated I got and why I missed that one phone call in the night (there having been at least 2 other answered calls).

Fast forward to present day and we have broken up because the jealousy got way too much to deal with and began to get me down quite a lot as well as make things slightly awkward between me and girls I get on well with. We are now separated but still very close as she always got on very well with my family and we care for each other regardless, this would be okay if I felt it was sustainable, but her not giving a fuck attitude is beginning to surface again more often. I think it makes her feel more confident or something, but it definitely drives me and others away.

How do I deal with a girl of this type? I'm considering the no contact route but is difficult as we have the same circle of friends, if not, is there a way of approaching touchy conversations I may not have tried yet?

The thing that attracted me to her was how impulsive she was.  The day I actually talked to her for the first time, we were in the break room with several other people. We'd talked in passing earlier in the day, but this was the moment that caused the spark:  She was having a bad day, and I said said something to which she calmly replied that she would slap me.  I told her to do it, not expecting it but sort of hoping she would.


She did, without hesitation.  Everyone reacted the way you'd expect, but I just smiled, laughed, and told her to do it again.  For the next half hour, we proceeded to bond, and I got her number.  You know, the start of any healthy relationship.  That was about 4 weeks ago.


I'd notice her eyeing me every once in a while after that, and I generally felt that if I wanted to I could have her with no trouble.  I'd never been more confident about anything.  But I didn't immediately pursue, and she ended up approaching me, and while we were talking, our gay coworker apparently decided to play wingman for one of us and asked her what her plans were for Valentine's, thus leading her to glance at me and say:


Oh, nothing...just hanging out with my cats...^Idon'tevenhaveaboyfriend


Taking the obvious cue, I swooped in and became her date on Valentine's Day.


From then on, she was very excited.  That night, she was eyeing me even more, and when she went back to work, she stroked me cheek as she passed me by.  Every time she saw me, she'd grab my attention somehow, and she'd make a point of entering my personal bubble.  


on the day of our planned first date, she voiced her excitement.  Not just to me, either, but apparently some of her friends at work.  She'd stay extra close to me when she could, and she was already making plans for me to take her to 50 Shades.  Of her own accord.


If that's not her overtly telling me she wants the D and plans to take it, I don't know what is.

But when I walk past her at work the next day without acknowledging her, she goes after me with a Fine, don't say hi.


I give her the silent treatment, and she says You look upset.  I remain silent for a bit, ask her how her friends are, and she says they're fine.  I walk off with a dismissive wave and get back to work.


2 hours later, she asks me if I got her texts, to which I say I don't keep my phone on me at work.  She tells me I'll like them, and walks off.  I actually get my hopes up for an apology for blowing me off on the worst day you could possibly blow someone off.


Instead I later find out she opted instead for the look at how cute I'm being, how can you stay mad method, wherein you text a thousand small texts meant to make the phone vibrate in your pocket until you pick up.  She apologized, but only after I told her I was still mad.
 

I'm giving her another chance this week with 50 Shades, which she still claims she wants me to take her to, but she's off the work schedule now, and she treats me differently when I'm not there in person.  Dismissive and difficult to finalize plans with.


I don't know what to make of this.  Normally I'd assume I'm being toyed with, but if I'm being toyed with, how can she be so excited that she brags to other people about our plans?  Why would she be planning out future dates of her own accord?  She seems too genuinely infatuated with me to be doing this out of malicious intent.


Is it sudden cold feet?  Nervousness?  Is she just a bitch?


Do I just stop being real to her as soon as she can't reach out and touch me? Is it just because I'm meat to her?


**tl;dr**: Girl shows all the signs of attraction, both voluntary and involuntary, and she makes it known to others that she is excited about us, without my knowledge.  She even goes do far as to make plans beyond those plans...But then has difficulty making those plans happen.   

When I have a physical presence, she seems lovestruck, but when I'm not there and text her, she treats me like I'm chopped liver.

I realize that this is relationship, if you can call it that, is not healthy.  But I'd still like it to have some payoff, and to figure out what I is going through her mind, even if it doesn't end well.","Me [22 M] and a soon to be ex-coworker [20 F] have been in a hot and cold, Dating phase for about 2 weeks now, I want help figuring out what is going through her head.",0.0,False,2.0,2.0,1424761947.0,/r/relationships/comments/2wytum/me_22_m_and_a_soon_to_be_excoworker_20_f_have/,Romantic
24255,Breakups,1sdb2o,"Hi guys, I'm sure this is a pretty standard post but I am desperate for some guidance and appreciate any wise words you can give me.

My ex and I started dating when we were both 17, and he broke up with me last November when we were both 18. He was my first everything, from kiss to sex. I was crazy in love with him, and I know he felt the same. I know this is such a stereotypical naive young person thing, but I honestly thought he was the one for me.

He broke up with me because he felt that he should be on his own being that it was our first year of college in order to find himself. I was absolutely devastated and heartbroken. For awhile we still talked, sometimes briefly, sometimes long phone calls that would end up turning into fights. 

He was clearly not at all over me (got very upset when he found out I was even so much as talking to other guys) and I was certainly not over him. At some point, a few months later, I cut off communication with him completely, feeling I needed to in order to get over him.

A few months later I met my current boyfriend, who I am still with. I like him a lot, but I worry because I just dont feel the same way about him as I did about this other guy. We have a great relationship, in many ways actually better than I had with my ex. For example, my ex was extremely controlling and possessive, and likewise I always felt like I just couldnt quite trust him. He would flirt with other girls, and when I called him out on it say that I was being crazy and overly possessive.

On the other hand, my current partner trusts me and I trust him, and he is never controlling or possessive. 

However I still cant stop feeling like I just dont feel that same connection with him...although this may be partly because we havent been together very long. 

Anyways. My ex also has a new girlfriend- one of the girls he used to flirt with, actually. (So clearly I am crazy). I cant help but feel jealous and angry whenever I think about him being with her or see pictures of them together. He still pops into my mind multiple times a day. 

I feel like its been long enough that I shouldnt still be feeling this way. I feel like it may be partly my low self esteem being damaged...I hate feeling replaced. I hate feeling like he might love her the way he used to love me. I worry that I will never find that feeling of deep mutual love again. I dont want to be thinking about him all the time. 

It makes me feel guilty for feeling this way because I really do like my new partner. 

I just dont understand why I still feel this way, I feel crazy, especially because I am so young. How can I stop feeling this way? How can I stop agonizing over this and feeling so hurt and jealous whenever I think of him being with someone else?

Wow. That was a lot. I apologize for such a long winded post. If there is any advice anyone can give me, maybe youve gone through something similar...I would be infinitely grateful.

**tl;dr**: Went out with my ex for a bit over a year. Broke up when we were both 18 in our first year of college which was over a year ago. Still feel sad, think about him multiple times a day, and get extremely jealous/angry when I see him with/think about him having a new girlfriend.

24257,Dating,2giuzf,"Let me start off with a little background. We are both currently juniors in high school and I've known her for little over a year now. My mother and sister know her family VERY well and have told me about them several times prior to me meeting her. We both go to the same high school and have been talking to each other a lot and sharing life stories, opinions, etc. Let me also mention that when we spoke or texted, it seemed like she was extremely interested and enjoyed my company, but that also might have been me enjoying her company.


Anyways, when I first met her, my mouth might have dropped a little. There aren't that many attractive girls at my high school and she looked like she came from a fantasy. Very smart, pretty, and reserved. Now I wouldn't consider myself attractive to any girl, but I was hoping I could get a chance with her. I'm also not very good around people (especially girls) and quite an introvert, but I've never had troubles making friends with anyone. 


For about a year I slowly got comfortable around her and started talking to her deeper and more often. We wouldn't just talk about homework or school or our futures, we'd talk about concepts, ideas, things that are happening, our thoughts and feelings and it would become very personal. 


During a long weekend, I finally summoned the courage to tell her about my feelings. Being not very good around girls and not having a way to meet up with her to talk to her face-to-face, I decided to send her a text message that explained how I felt and what was on my mind to her. Simply put, I was rejected and sort of friend-zoned. She said that she thought I was a cool guy and that her current activities and schoolwork didn't allow her for a relationship, even though I didn't ask for one. She did, however, state that she values friendships more than anything and wanted to stay friends with me no matter what.

I simply wanted her to know how I felt. I may not have been the smartest person ever, but I had to get that off my chest otherwise I would have went to college knowing that I didn't even TRY. I respect her and her decision but I have no idea if it's the reason she gave me.

So my question is: what do I do now? Should I just stay friends with her? She seems almost perfect in every way imaginable but the excuses are really getting to me. It's made me an even bigger critic of myself.

I appreciate ANY responses or advice, I just have no one to go to and thought /r/relationships would be the best place for me to ask for advice.


---   
**TL;DR**: Liked a girl for over a year, summoned the courage to tell her how I felt over text message (problem talking to girls), was probably put in the friend-zone because she doesn't have time for a relationship (didn't ask for a relationship), don't know if I should give her time or move on or what.

24258,Breakups,1j24eo,"I started dating this girl back in Sophomore year of High school. As time progressed we became very close, and I spent almost all of my time with her. Towards the end of our relationship, I was going over to her house every day that I could, and often wouldn't go home until midnight. I also got to know her family and friends really closely, and it's hard to cut myself off from them too.

College is now coming up around the corner and she is moving very far away (over 3000 miles for college) and we had talked about at least trying out a long term relationship to see if it was even possible. Just last week she came over to my house and broke up with me. She stated that she was unhappy being in a relationship and wanted to focus on herself while she was in college.

While I can understand her viewpoint, it's hitting me harder than a freight train. Things that I used to find fun are now dull and boring. Television shows that I used to watch with her cause me to almost burst into tears because all I can think of is her. I even went out biking 20 miles (I've never biked that distance in my life and haven't been working out for a while). I went against the no contact rule and tried to speak with her. She told me that she needed some time and basically enforced the rule for herself. 

I don't know what to do with myself, everything seems to be falling apart. I'm trying to be logical about this, but it's really difficult when my heart and my mind are so split apart.

24259,Dating,2o83lw,"I [26F] have been seeing this woman [30F] I met on an online dating site for a month and a half now. While we didn't have an instant connection on the first date this is pretty normal for me, as I am a pretty shy person and it takes me a little while to become unawkward and warm up. She stated on her profile that she wanted to take it slow and be friends first. We hung out 4 times the first two weeks, but always with a friend of hers there. I liked her and thought she was attractive, but with the third wheel(s) along it was hard to get to know her and really decide if there was real dating potential there. 

Background info on me: I have mostly been in a series of long term relationships and got into those without dating in the traditional sense, having been friends for a long time before becoming romantically involved, so I am super inexperienced when it comes to dating.

Anyways, I tried to get her to go on a just us date, but she then invited more people along. It was fine, I still had a good time, but I was getting a little frustrated. The next day I called her and asked her point blank if she was at all interested in dating/attracted. I told her that I would be genuinely fine continuing to hang out as just friends if that's all she wanted (I'm always down for more friends :) ) She said she wasn't uninterested, but because of a lot of rl issues (all pretty valid and complex, including being out of work among other things I'm not going to go into because they are her private business) she needed to take things really slow and be friends first. She admitted that inviting along third wheels was somewhat of a defense mechanism in that way. I said that was fine, and I was fine taking things slow, but would still like to go out with just her sometime, as I wanted to get to know her better without the awkwardness an extra person along adds. 

She agreed and we went out to dinner that night. Halfway through dinner she almost burst into tears for reasons I still don't know. My theory is she had memories associated with the place. Her and her ex probably went there a good bit, as it's a popular local restaurant. She has been broken up with her ex for months and claims to be over her, but they were in a 4 year relationship and were engaged, so there is probably some residual baggage still there. So, I felt like that was a pretty clear sign she wasn't ready to date again. I gave her some space, didn't text etc, and she finally texted me a cpl days later telling me she wasn't ready to date again but she was insistent that she still did want to keep hanging out as friends. I told her that was fine by me and I totally understood. 

Over the couple weeks I invited her to hang out periodically, structuring it in a way where it seemed friendly instead of datelike (telling her to bring her roommate too, etc) as I did think she was cool peeps and wanted to make it clear I was genuinely ok with being friends. She always had some reason to decline (sick, busy, etc) and I assumed she was trying to pull a fade away. I'm the kind of person who likes things to be concrete rather than nebulous, and I don't keep people on FB who I don't know very well and/or don't hang out or talk to at all. On a personal note I was really unpopular in middle school and having my friendship overtures be rejected were bringing back some of those old sad lame kid feelings. So I sent her a message basically saying that while I wasn't going to keep her on FB for privacy reasons, I really enjoyed meeting her, best of luck, etc.  and figured that would be that.

Much to my surprise, she responded almost immediately, acting very upset. She said she did really want to be friends, and had actually genuinely been super busy. She said Here, I'll prove it, lets hang out tonight asap. I pick her up, she suggests going to bar and getting some drinks. We go to a chill bar where you can actually have a convo, have a good time, and once she has a drink in her she says she is very attracted to me but for various reasons doesn't want to hurt herself or me and is very wary of getting into a dating relationship. 

I'm confused as to why she's bringing up attraction and dating, as I thought I'd made it pretty clear I was totally cool with being friends, but I figure she must think she hurt my feelings and is trying to soothe my pride or something and shrug it off. At the bar, this old dude is creepin' on us so we go back to my place to play cards. She makes a pass at me, I don't hate it, tldr we have sex with her as the agressor/initiator at every step of the way. I probably should have declined, but girls are soft and smell nice and that makes me dumb. But I'm SO confused that she took it there after her whole speech about friendzoning this because of her issues etc. Also I warned her that if we had sex I'd probably develop more serious feels than just platonic friends, as I'm not the hook up type and am not capable of purely casual sex. She said that she was ok with that. 

We've hung out a few times since, but it's been solidly platonic, as I am near paranoid about respecting boundaries and my one attempt to intiate cuddles since the incident was rebuffed. She has also started blowing off my invitations more often than not/responding infrequently via text again, claiming to be really busy. 

TL:DR: I'm worried that she just had sex with me to keep me around as an option, or as a friend w benefits, but I don't want to be unfairly judgy if that's not the case. I'm not a friends with benefits type of person (not that there's anything wrong with that if you are), I like either friendship or dating, I don't like the middle ground. Should I just quietly stop texting? Should I press her for a more defined relationship? Should I give it more time and chill? Am I expecting too much from her at this stage? Is she stringing me along until something better comes along? I don't know halp D:

24260,Dating,29u6sm,"So the past few weeks, I took a liking to a girl that I would see out and about and would visit a lot to where she worked. Not because she worked there, it's just a place I frequent. She happened to work there. 

About three weeks ago, I struck up a conversation with her that lasted over an hour. She ended up sitting with me and we had a good talk, got to know one another, etc. After a while, I said I had to go and told her I would probably see her again. My day off is normally when I go in and happens to be when she's working.

So a few more times, I would go in, say hi, we would talk for a minute and exchange some quick flirting until I either left or sat down. This past week, the same thing happened. We sat and talked for a super long time and this time before I left, I asked if she ever wanted to grab lunch or a drink sometime? She answered with a absolutely, yes!-- we exchanged numbers and she said hows tomorrow sound for you? after I get off?-- so we set that date for the following day. 

Once I got home, I texted her so she had my number and she wrote back she was excited for tomorrow and it'll be nice to actually sit with you and not have to get up to do work every few minutes.-- I'm excited because I havent' asked anyone out in... I don't even know when. Years. 

We met up, had our drinks and she asked if I could walk her back to her car. I did and after talking for a few minutes, I asked if she wanted to go for a walk and she was happy to. We walked around for another 30 minutes or so? Everything seemed nice, lots of flirting, she told me she liked hearing me talk? Spoke about other things we should do together. I had to check myself because I was like, is this moving really fast?

Anyway, we got back to her car, hugged goodbye, and ended up kissing for a few minutes. I told her to we should get going and to let me know when she gets home. She never did, though, but I think her phone died because she mentioned it was going to before we left. Though I texted her and said i had a great time and would like to do it again soon. 

Everything seemed to flow and we were on the same page and now... they don't. My texts to say hi seem like a bother. We made a joke about how we hate our jobs and that we can always entertain each other if the day sucks. I texted her once when I was at work and didn't hear back for almost 10 hours. I know people get busy, and she even apologized for it, but it seems weird now. 

The other night were talking and she kept going on and on about how horrible her day was, how she needs to go for a walk, or relax but wouldn't say what it was that made her day horrible. I don't know her THAT well, so I didn't know what to say other than exactly that-- I know you don't know me that well,  but if you need to vent or just complain, feel free to vent to me-- no response and she later asked how my day was. 

The other night as we texted about our days. Her was horrible again without an explanation. I mentioned something we could do soon and her response was Not tonight. I'm too tired. But another time please!

I had to laugh because this was at 2 AM. Tonight?! I'm going to bed soon! Hahaha. I meant down the line. 

So anyway, everything seems forced and awkward to me now. I know I have a VERY bad problem blowing things out of proportion and have anxiety problems that make me try to push as hard as I can to fix things. I want to avoid that. 

Again, my day off is this week and I know she works then, but I don't know if I should even go in. I've already told my friends I wish I stopped asking people out when I like them because it always turns into this. I think it's because the bar was set so high and fast that anything below it seems wrong to me. 

What do I do?

So we broke up about 7 months ago after dating a year and a half. The details of the break up and why it happened is pretty complicated so I'll highlight the main points. I broke it off with her because my family dislikes her (which was tearing me apart hearing both sides complain about the other), we were both immature for what we wanted (to eventually get married), and because I was going through personal issues (depression, anxiety, etc). I DID NOT break up with her because I did not love her. I am DEEPLY in love with her.

Post Breakup she ignored me and essentially was super rude to me if I even tried to talk to her, which I do deserve. So I split off from our mutual friend group and found another set of friends far away from her. We didn't really speak or see each other at all until summer rolled around at the end of May since we both have an internship at a large tech company. 

Summer just beginning, and I see her for the first time. now granted she's been hurting this whole time and is bitter towards me and I'm torn up because I still love her and have been apart from her for so long. We started talking again and then there were a couple emotional conversations over the phone about how I've been torn up and she talked about the fact she didn't want a boyfriend right now. So it hurts me to much that I stop talking to her fro a few weeks. 

Fast forward a few weeks, I decide I want to meet up with her and talk with her and really let her know I still love her. She agrees to meet to talk, but then I see her being all flirty with this guy. I text her asking if they were a thing to which she replied we kind of are, but I'm unsure about alot of things with him to which I respond oh okay, nvm I don't think it's a good idea to meet up anymore since I wanted to avoid drama. Her reply to that was I still want to here what you have to say. At this point I think there is hope, so I agree. We eventually meet up and I pour my soul out to her about how much I love her and how I spent a lot of time working on myself to fix things. In the beginning of the conversation she immediately said she didn't want to get back together with me right now and I said I didn't want to just get back together I wanted to take her on dates and stuff first, and by the end of the conversation she said she was more open to the idea of it now and that after summer back at school she wouldn't be opposed to a date, but that she just wants to be friends right now.

Pretty much everyone in my life when I explained the situation to them said she chose a summer fling instead of me and so she isn't even worth it. It's been really hard for me because I am very deeply in love with her, and I don't want to give up and it's just not in my heart to do so.

So I've been trying to be friends with her, but at the same time I told her I wasn't going to hide my feelings for her or motive for being her friend (to eventually get back with her). I've been trying to make an effort to talk to her or hang out with her, such as sparking conversation or I invited her to come bowling with some friends.

She says she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me anymore but I don't think that is true and she seems to be sending mixed signals for example she said remember that one time you ran across campus to grab my project for me because I forgot it and was freaking out to which I replied Yeah, I'd do anything for you and she responded Why are you so sweet. or when I told her no one else will love you more than I do, she AGREES. Then at the same time she's either distant or indifferent or even ignores me sometimes. She starts the conversation sometimes and wanted to get coffee again sometime but then she never tried to setup and actual time. 

It seems to be she went from no, to maybe, to I have no romantic feelings for you, to saying she has mixed feelings for me. My gut tells me she just pushed those feelings she had for me way deep down. I also don't understand why she is with the guy when they both know it won't last for the summer. And what would the 5 week difference between now and being back at school be for her not to even want to go on a date now. 

I'm so confused to the point that it's driving me crazy. I just want her back for good and some of the things she says and does contradicts other things.
   
**tl;dr**: Essentially, I broke with my Ex but not because I didn't love her. 7 months later I try to get back with her.

Before I start; yes I know - I am young and naive. The stuff that I'm experiencing is probably so insignificant (especially compared to some of the other stuff posted on here), but it doesn't change the fact that I don't know what to do or what to feel and I simply need help.

My ex-girlfriend (we'll call her Lauren) and I go to the same high school. We're both now in our final year, and will be finishing up around November of this year (we're in Australia). We never really knew each other until we were put in a class together last year, and we immediately hit it off. We spoke all the time, and when the holidays came around we would talk all day until one of us fell asleep that night. We shared a lot of personal things together, and the connection I had with her was unlike anything I've ever experienced with anyone else. Before meeting Lauren I was feeling extremely lonely, and she gave me something I cherished so dearly - someone to talk too. After months of growing extremely close to her, I finally worked up the courage to ask her to be my girlfriend last October. She said yes, I was over the moon, as was she. 

Our relationship continued along this pattern of 'closeness' for the next few months until school started again this February. Without trying to come off as arrogant or cocky, Lauren and I are both relatively high achievers at school. She especially is the type of person that works extremely hard with her studies as simply put, she wants to be the best. I understood this going into our relationship - she needed space to focus on school and I did my best to give that to her once we started up this year. 

However, I began feeling extremely neglected by her the more the weeks elapsed. Lauren *never* initiated conversations over skype or text (which was our main point of contact outside of school due to cultural difficulties with her parents). As well as this, she would *never* seek me out to talk whilst at school, so if I wanted to spend a lunch break with her for example, I would have to find her and seperate her from other people she was talking too. I'm not sure if this is normal behaviour in a relationship, but I always felt a little neglected considering a) it was such a sudden and drastic change from our contact in the holidays prior, and b) even when I brought it up nothing ever changed (in fact she said she wanted *less* contact at one instance).

Regardless, for the months following we fell into a trend where I would spend 15 minutes walking to the station with her after school every day, and a couple of lunch breaks a week with her. In total it was roughly 3 hours of contact with my girlfriend every week, which for me really sucked, but I adored this girl (and still do tbh) so if it made her happy I would suck it up. However, a few weeks ago before the first term holidays (we have three 2-week break holidays throughout the school year here in Australia), I noticed she seemed a little distant when we were together. After some prodding and questioning she admitted that, in her words, she feels bad because her friends always comment on how amazing I am, yet she doesn't like me as much as before. This obviously stung, but I understood that you can't really control how you feel and didn't hold any malice or bitterness or anything like that. I guess the thing that bothered me was how she just cut me off and didn't talk or explain anything further to me, despite her promises and guarantees she would. 

After a few days however I accepted that we'd probably be breaking up, but I knew I'd see her at a school formal event a few days later and that I'd have to confront her then. I did, we broke up, said to each other we could still remain close, hugged, and left. I guess at that time I was quite numb about the whole situation, and 2-weeks of school holidays without seeing or speaking to her helped me move on and get any bad thoughts out of my mind.

My downward spiral of emotions began this Monday, however, when school resumed. Lauren and I share no classes this year, but obviously we can see each other during study sessions, breaks, and before/after school. This may sound silly Reddit, but it gets hard from here because I'm not exactly sure what to write, as I'm not 100% sure what it is I'm feeling. I suppose, for one, I feel incredibly lonely as I lost my one close companion in Lauren. I have friends at this school, but there's no one who I'm particularly close with, and because of this I'm left to sit by myself for an hour during breaks and walk to the train station alone. Also, I feel I'd be able to get over Lauren easily if we didn't share the same school, as it pains me every day knowing that she's in exactly the same building as me yet I'm not sure if she'd even want to see/speak to me. The times I have spoken to her this week she's been relatively normal, yet she's seemed awkward/distant towards me. I have no idea if she wants to be friends or for me to leave her alone for the rest of the year. I just feel like I lost the only thing that brightened my day - and it was so fast... like I just blinked and suddenly she was out of my life.

Basically, I don't know how to comprehend my feelings and I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal. Also, I'm not sure how I should proceed in my relationship with Lauren.

I'm sorry that this probably makes no sense, I tried my best. If you read this whole thing, thank you so much. I can't tell you how much it means to me. I suppose I'm just confused and I've got no one else to turn to, so any comments/advice is appreciated.

Again, thank you.

She was My first kiss, first time and best friend. We have dated since we were freshman. She had loved me like nobody had and we were each others first real loves. It was hard to accept when she said she wanted to end, I mean I cried for the first time in years, really broke down and started changing how I felt about a lot. I hate after she had said that but stuck around until today. I wish she would have just left before putting me through this. 

I had felt relieved now that I didn't have to worry and feel like hell anymore, but I saw she deleted me from snapchat and all that shit and it really hurt. I am going to miss sleeping next to her, her laugh, her smile, her scent. I am going to miss the times we had, how we finished each others thoughts and could know what the other was thinking. I am going to miss thinking of marriage and her being my wife. I am going to miss how we held each other, the feeling of her lips. Everything.. She is leaving a huge void in my life. I haven't been alone since I was 14.

How do I get over her leaving for the reason of being unhappy when I did everything, gave her all she wanted and did it all right. I gave her a family, a best friend, and a rock. She just threw me aside like it was nothing when she filled my head with promises of forever and never hurting me. How do I get over this? It feels like I'll never get love like that again and have a connection like that again. I don't wanna not trust girls in the future or have love issues from this, but I really don't know how I won't. Please help me, I feel and have felt depressed and have had thoughts of suicide. I won' t act on them, I just want them to stop.

I (18m) recently hit it off with a girl (19f) I know from university. We were attracted to each other, shared interests, etc.; however, when she found out that I don't have a cell phone, she thought it was a bit weird and creepy and seemed to lose interest in me. I'm not upset about it because we had just met and I wasn't really emotionally attached to her, but it's kind of sticking with me. I'm nearly 100% sure this was the reason she lost interest (she told me), and I'm pretty sure she overreacted, but I don't know. I understand where she's coming from, but I feel a bit differently. 

I think she thought it was weird because everyone our age has one... it's by far the most popular way to communicate with friends/family/SOs. I'm afraid she thinks I'm just trying to be a 'hipster', and not having a cell phone is my defiant way of being anti-technology and indie. This is totally not the case; I legitimately enjoy the freedom it brings and there are other practical ways I keep in touch with friends and family (i.e. Facebook, pay-phones). I used to have a cell phone, but got rid of it a couple years ago because I didn't like how it affected my day-to-day life.  

I understand that it can be frustrating for a SO to not be able to just text me whenever, but there are definitely ways around it, like Facebook (I use it on a laptop). The only other SO I've ever had didn't seem to mind too much, but IDK. I'm thinking about just getting one to avoid this issue, but, like I mentioned earlier, I like the freedom of not having to deal with it. Is that selfish?

Is not having a cell phone a deal-breaker in a relationship at my age? Does it strike people as weird? Is she an outlier or is this a real issue?

Throwaway here, but a bit of background first.

I'm with a girl that lives a few hours away. I'll preface this by saying she's just awesome, totally gorgeous and great in so many ways. It was totally worth it going to see her for weekends, even though it was a pain to do so. I spent weekends there for the first few months, then my car broke down. It's been a month since that, I had to move next to work so I could walk and keep the job during hard times. She's moving across country in a few months, and my plan is to go with her, I have family where she's going anyways. I've been trying to figure out how to see her in the meantime, but it's not easy with low income and trying to save for the move.

And while I love her to death, she's not very trusting. She's had some very bad experiences with people in the past. I understand it's hard to let that go, I have had similar experiences. She also battles with depression, some days are just terrible for her. I do what I can to help, but from here it's not enough, and it's not easy for her to let me in during that.

Onto what happened. Last night I get home from work and we're texting. She hasn't been around for a few hours so I figure she's busy, I tell her I'm gonna take a nap. So I do, and about a few hours later I get a phone call, which I groggily ignore, and then another one, which I reach over and pick up, and see it's her. I was straight up a zombie at that point, more asleep than awake. So I'm yawning and make a few grumpy noises. She hangs up without saying anything. So I'm puzzled, but just kind've shrug and pass right back out. Which was a big mistake looking back on it.

I wake up before work to a few texts, which I didn't even think were serious accusations, so groggy me responds with the usual good morning, how'd you sleep etc. She flat out accuses me of cheating on her, so I reread the previous ones and it makes sense. She thinks my walking dead esque shit from last night were moans, and I was screwing another girl. And there are many reasons why that can't be (Out in the country, don't have a car, don't know anyone here just moved, I don't sound like a girl, why would anyone pick up during something like that if it were true, etc), but she isn't having any of it, and she's taking it very badly.

She's in classes now, but I'm a bit worried she'll overthink this and just shut me out. At the very least it will crush any amount of trust I've built with her, even if I manage to convince her I wasn't having sexy time. She means the world to me, I have to be able to fix this. Any thoughts? And thanks for taking the time to read this.

**Update**: Spoke with her, all is well/forgiven apparently. She even said she did trust me. But this has definitely been thought provoking, will consider all advice given. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and reply.

This has been the most difficult week of my life. Nothing in my past could have prepared me for this, and I've [been through some shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1s8pq5/guys_of_reddit_whats_the_weirdest_place_youve/cdv2yxe) (and that doesn't even count my upbringing).

I haven't had a single panic attack in about four years (I used to get them all the time). This past week, I've had at least seven. Complete, absolute meltdowns - sobbing uncontrollably, unable to move or function, shaking uncontrollably, etc. It has been hell.

I've been trying to keep myself busy and task-oriented to keep me from sitting and thinking too much. I spent a great deal of time the first few days after the breakup just helping my brother with all his stuff at the datacenter and his office. Mostly lugging around computers as we relocated a bunch of hardware. I've barely eaten anything in a week, too. I have no appetite and just don't even think about it. People have to remind me to eat. I've probably lost 10 pounds.

From reading my last post you'll know that I blocked her and her whole family. I am too vulnerable and too messed up to speak to her or anyone close to her. I'm on the edge already, and there is a good chance they could push me over.

Even so, I've heard through the grapevine (mutual friends, etc) that she is blaming me for everything: I gave him all the time he needed to change, he didn't give me any!, He's just selfish, How could he do this to my son!?, etc. So her pattern continues: it's all my fault, no matter what. I had some hope she would change as a result of this event, but it seems that is not the case. That hurt my heart just a bit more. It's possible she will have a rude awakening once she has to start paying the bills (I covered most of them for this month) but I don't really know if she will or not.

I have yet to sleep at my new place. I've been sleeping at my brother's house. A few days after this all went down, my brother and I went over to my new place and started putting things away, cleaning up, etc. After about ten minutes another panic attack set in and I lost it, again. I couldn't stop sobbing and repeating This isn't my home, I just want to go home. I told him I needed to leave so we left. It 
continued all the way back to his house. It was horrible.

Two days ago, I went to a therapist. He's my brother's therapist and already knows the whole backstory of my upbringing and my insane mother. For an hour I just vomited all the pain, misery and self-loathing. I told him about all the shit that had happened throughout the relationship, all the things I'd fucked up and how I'd tried to fix them, and most of the things she'd said/done to me. He just listened to my story and, whenever I'd say something particularly terrible, he would shake his head and say wow.

When I was done talking, I said I know therapists don't like doing this, but I can't trust my own judgement right now. I need to know if I did the right thing - I need to hear it from a professional.. He told me You did the right thing. and then continued to explain to me what his interpretation of the relationship was. He told me Based on what you've told me, you've been in an abusive relationship for five years. It sounds to me like she has some major issues of her own that she simply refuses to acknowledge or address. I don't believe she is capable of being in a mature, healthy relationship. You did everything you could to work with her, save the relationship and improve your own health. The fact that she wasn't willing to do the same *is not your fault*.

After that, he told me that I was in a very vulnerable place and needed to have no contact with her for now. I needed to stick close to my support structure and rely on them to keep me together and help me get through this. He told me to stay task oriented and focus on specific goals, such as finding a job, going to my next men's group meeting, etc.

Two nights ago I was in a really bad place and went over to my friend's house (one of the guys from my group) and another guy came over also. They've both divorced/broken up with abusive women and so they had a lot of good things for me to hear. Once they had talked me down from yet another panic attack, they gave me lots of great info, examples and ideas for how to get through this.

One of the major problems with Nice Guy Syndrome is that the nice guy himself is almost completely unaware of his own emotions and feelings. He experiences them, but doesn't understand what they are or where they come from. Oftentimes, if asked to put a name to an emotion, he is unable to do so. That is what I was going through with my panic attacks. My friends asked me why I was panicking, and I couldn't answer. I had a horrible feeling, but I didn't know what it was.

Yesterday morning, I think I figured it out - at least partially. It was abject terror.

Why terror? What was causing me to feel terrified? I sat with these questions and finally came up with an answer: I have no idea who I am.

I have no idea who I am, what I like, what I want or what I need. For my entire life, my identity has been based on other people. My emotional state, sense of self-worth and wants/desires/needs were based on the person closest to me in my life. When I was growing up, that was my mother, then my first GF, then the next GF (the one who cheated on me with my father and then they got married), then this GF.

Because my existence has been defined by other people, I have no idea who I am or what I want. I almost don't even see a point in existing if I don't have someone to help and take care of. Leaving her and moving out has torn away my identity. I am left an empty shell. That is terrifying, and has caused my panic attacks.

Now, realizing this, I've been able to address it. I've not had a breakdown since yesterday morning. I still have an ache of loss, but now I mostly just feel empty.

Last night was my men's group, and they were all so proud of me and so happy for me. Many of them understand being used and abused by unhealthy women, and were able to empathize and share their experiences. Seeing them, now, happier than they have ever been, gives me some small glimmer of hope for the future.

On a happy note, friends have been seemingly appearing out of nowhere. People I haven't talked to in a long time have heard about this and have contacted me to see how they could help. I've received an outpouring of love, support and help from so many people that I didn't expect to do so. It is absolutely bizarre being the one receiving love and help, rather than giving it. 

A good friend of mine has already found basically full furnishings for my new place, for free. She has been posting on facebook, calling friends she knew were moving, etc, and found me furniture, a bed, kitchen stuff, towels, etc. I basically got out of there with nothing, and she has done all this for me. I am so grateful to her. Her friends who gave me furniture, though I had never met them, were so kind, and loving and supportive. It was amazing to feel all that support and love from them.

And, a final note. I would like to especially thank /u/idontmeananyofit for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2i5obz/today_i_30m_broke_up_with_my_31_f_girlfriend_of_5/ckzh7f7).

It was heartbreaking and wonderful at the same time. Thank you.

I had anger issues (always yelling, no physical abuse) and she didn't want to deal with it because of her past issues of that escalating. Once she left I enrolled in anger management classes and have been able to control my anger. I've done no contact, deleted and blocked all social media, dated other women.... NOTHING HAS WORKED. 

I just can't get her off my mind. She was the only girl to treat me right. She never took advantage of me, no abuse, no anything. She treated me like any good SO would, and I've lost that. For the longest, I've wanted that second chance. But I don't think she'd be willing to give it to me; friendship or something more. And it's killing me inside. Since the day I met her, she's meant the world to me. I was always happy when it was just her and me. But now that she's gone and stayed gone... so has my smile.

She is wanting to engage in an open relationship and explore her sexuality with some other people (potentially older / more experienced or with other girls) and also wanting me to do the same sort of thing while still keeping our relationship at the center.


I'm having a few issues with this idea from an emotional perspective. My mind is saying sure why not, but emotionally it doesn't sit right. Some of the issues i'm having are that I can't imagine the thought of another guy having sex with her, however slightly more okay with her with another girl. I feel a whole heap of emotions about it and i'm having a hard time figuring what these exactly are.
I a few of the emotional things that i've felt about it so far are:
- I've always viewed our relationship as quite special and something that only us should share but at the same time my mind is okay with the idea of opening it up for experimentation
- If we did do something, i'd rather it was something that we both did together, such as her experiment with a girl with me there also joining in. Not sure of why I might feel this way.


But apart from the few thoughts i've had above i'm having trouble working out what i'm feeling on this, it all just seems so confusing. Its making me feel anxious and confused and not sure what the next step should be.

24309,Infidelity,2b99xw,"My girlfriend and I were FWB for 6 months, made it official in January.

I had known this other girl (let's call her B) since the start of the school year in September. I was interested in her instantly. She texted and snapchatted me quite often, enough that I knew she was interested back. Meanwhile, my gf and I were still FWB, so I didnt think too much of talking to B without her knowing.

In January, my gf left for an internship for 4 months, and we agreed to do long distance. Things were overall alright. All the while though, she was hanging out with an old flame of hers, and no matter what I said, she couldn't understand why I had a problem with it. I never want to hook up with him became I'll always have feelings for him. This really pissed me off, and was a thorn in my side during those 4 months. I blame this for (stupidly) justifying why cheating was OK; I was so mad, but couldn't get through to her. I didn't know if she really loved me.

In April, just as the school year was winding down, I drunkenly texted B, came over to her place and hooked up with her. I never told B about my girlfriend, and when B started to get attached, I broke it off with her. There were no feelings involved, simply my horny mind making stupid decisions. I haven't talked to B since.

I never told my girlfriend because I assumed that we wouldn't last much longer. Instead, since my girlfriend came back in May, our summer has been amazing. There's no doubt that we love each other, and I've been a selfish scumbag keeping this secret from her.

The issue now is that she is leaving on a backpacking trip for 8 months in two weeks. We've insinuated that we should break it off before she leaves, (I dont want to ruin a good thing, she says), because we probably wouldn't last that long apart from each other.

I feel so shitty because I want to do the right thing, but I don't know what that right thing is. Do I tell her before she goes? Do I not tell her and save her the pain of knowing? If I don't tell her, there's enough of a chance that my girlfriend will find out: her roommate is in the same club as B, starting in September. I expect that they'll figure out the connection between us, and possibly B will tell her roommate what happened, which will get relayed to my girlfriend.

I'm such a scumbag. Fuck, what do I do? Does anyone have suggestions?

24312,Dating,2o96ea,"Hello r/relationships,

this may seem like a weird thing to ask but I'm really not totally sure on the situation I'm in right now and I thought maybe asking here would help me.

I (25,M) have been dating this woman (22) for the last 1 1/2 months, we've had a couple dates, she spent the night at my place once and we've been texting quite a lot and everything seemed to go pretty well in my opinion.

That is until last tuesday, which was the last time I heard something from her, she has since then not responded to my texts and didn't pick up the phone when I tried calling her either.

Now I guess the normal thought in this situation would be that she's just not into me, but I really didn't take her for a person that would terminate something like this after over a month by just not responding anymore and there are a couple more things that contribute to me just being very confused.

1.) She has right from the start told me that she doesn't like responding in a timely fashion and that she constantly gets into trouble with her friends for that (I sometimes take 2 weeks to respond), I have experienced this myself when she took 3 days to get back to me at one point.

2.) She's in quite a lot of stress at the moment, she has important exams either tomorrow or next week (I'd know exactly if she just talked to me), so that probably contributes to that as well, even though she could still give me at least a little heads up, especially if I'm telling her that I'm worried and asking her if she's alright.

3.) Her last message. She sent me that on last tuesday, like I said. The conversation went like this:

10:05 AM Me: Oh come on, the blue check marks have been there for 24 hours now :/ (talking about whatsapp of course, as I said she has a problem with answering in a timely fashion)

**10:10 AM Her: I hate those check marks :/ They have to go :(**

10:20 AM Me: I'd be annoyed if you didn't answer me for a day, even if those check marks weren't there ;) Wanna do something this week? That way I won't have to try and get all this info out of you through whatsapp :D

....nothing.

That was it. That was her last message to me. Who would just decide to end something like this?

So I guess my question is, am I dumped and if not what could I do in this situation?

Like 2 days later, she texted me saying I wasn't ready to be her friend and we shouldn't talk anymore.  It's been over a month now, and I haven't heard a peep from her.

24317,Dating,2lnafh,"I met the guy that I like at breakfast at school, which is the only time where the different grades in my school are allowed to mix. I am in tenth and he is in ninth. I'm two months older than him. When I first met him, I immediately felt attracted to him, but I thought that he didn't feel the same because dating has never really worked out for me in the past. 

I thought it was dumb for me to like a freshman because I wanted a serious relationship with someone I could potentially see myself going to college with, which was already far fetched because I make good grades and want to go to a top school. I could never imagine having a long-distance relationship, especially for a year because the school I am most interested in is far away from the city we live in. Not to mention the crap I knew people would give me if I actually dated a freshman

I tried to squash my feelings, but the more I saw him at breakfast with our mutual friend, and got to know each other more little by little, my feelings were becoming undeniable, but I thought there was no way he could feel the same anyway, trying to keep myself from becoming attached, because I have been hurt a couple times in the past from unrequited feelings. 

My entire freshman year, the only thing I ever heard about someone liking me was a weird boy who always asked me for help for every little thing we did in class, which I found extremely annoying. 

I went into tenth grade thinking that I would just be single for the rest of high school and go to prom alone because all the guys in my grade are cowards and not a lot of people date. 

However, when our mutual friend told me that he liked me, I had a sense of hope that I would actually get to be with someone. I told her that I also liked him. I'm pretty sure that he doesn't know that she told me this, or that I like him. 

One day a few weeks ago, I went to breakfast and he was the only one there, which was unusual because our mutual friend always came to breakfast. He wore a suit [which was not super unusual, because our school has a business dress code] and asked me many questions about myself. At one point, he even said, Sorry, I'm so awkward. I'm really not good at this. This made me think that he thought it was a date, which I was unsure about, but I didn't ask.

He also asked me to hang out one time, and was really awkward about it, and I didn't know if it was a date because you normally wouldn't get so nervous just to ask someone to hang out. I said yes anyways, but he emailed me the next day saying that it turned out he had a doctor's appointment that day, he would be getting dismissed early, so we couldn't hang out. He said that we would definitely reschedule.

A couple weeks later, he stops coming to breakfast, which is really the only time that I got to see him. I asked our friend why because she takes the same bus as him, and she said he is taking a later bus because he needs more sleep. Okay, but it's been two weeks now and he hasn't emailed me at all to talk or to reschedule that hanging out thing. I gave serious thought into giving all of this up, because now I am just disappointed with myself for getting my hopes up for someone again. 

However, I still can't get over him, because when we used to talk I found out we had a lot in common. I feel like I can't let this go, and that I need to do something. 

I made a plan to send him an email on Monday that says, Hey, I haven't seen you in a while. To try and open up a conversation.

TL;DR;
* There is this guy that I like and he likes me, but he doesn't know that I know and doesn't know yet that I like him.
* We might've had a date, but I was unsure. We were at breakfast alone, which was unusual, and he asked me a lot of questions about myself.
* He asked me to hang out once, and was obviously nervous when he did it. We never hung out because he ended having a doctor's appointment.
* He stopped coming to the place where we always see each other for a valid reason, but I still want to see him.
* We are in different grades in school, so I almost never see him because of the way my school is set up.
* He hasn't been around for 2 weeks.
* I really want to talk to him so we can turn this into an actual relationship.
* I want to email him saying, Hey, I haven't seen you in a while.

My husband and I have been married for almost 4 years. We've had plenty of ups and downs. He had an emotional affair for over 6 months a a few years ago. He said he doesn't know why he did it. I caught him multiple times talking to her and finally said it's her or me. He cut all contact with her. 

Shortly after that he asked a co-worker if she had feelings for him. She said no and he asked So if I kiss you you would feel nothing in return? She told me about it 5 months later while he was away for 6 months. 

I confronted him via FB as he was out of the country and he called upset saying it was stupid and he doesn't know why he did it. He said we'd talk about it in length when he came home. He ended up coming home early due to an accident with his father that ended up taking his dads life.

I supported him in every step of his dads hospitalization through the memorial service. Because of this I didn't bring up what had happened months earlier. He said we'd still talk about it but we never have. 

It's been a year since I found out about the second woman and it's still eating at me. He has emotionally turned off after his dad. He won't talk to anyone, he doesn't call his family until last minute on things, and is distant with me.

He had another business trip that was two weeks long. He came home halfway through for a party. He and I had gotten into a few arguments while he was gone. Wednesday night he had said he would call me and he didn't. I texted him that day around 2pm and he said yeah I'll call tonight after dinner. At 5pm I tried calling and he said he had just made it to eat and will call me in a little while. 

At 8pm I texted him again. He said he was still eating with his co-workers and would call me after drinks. At 11pm he calls. I was furious. I asked who he was with, he said a James and Amanda. I told him that I was tired of sitting around waiting for a phone call that might happen or not. He was drunk and said Somethings wrong with you. I don't know what it is but something is wrong with you in the head. You always think I'm lying to you when I'm not.

He calls me the next day like nothing happened. Weekend arrives, he comes home for the party, and is nothing but loving. He's sweet, romantic everything is perfect. He says sorry for not calling and he wants everything to be fine. He leaves early Sunday to head back to his hotel 4 hours away. 

He says he'll call me once he gets there. I get a text and then a phone call saying he's there and is going to dinner soon and he'll call me later. 

He calls around 8 and then he went to bed. I pay the phone bill that night. He wasn't to my texts and when I asked him why he said something was wrong with his phone. When I payed the bill I went under his messages received to see if he was getting them. He was. He was just too busy texting someone else to respond. They were texting back and forth and he had even texted her before telling me he had made it safe to his hotel by a good 40 minutes. 

I don't say anything. Now, during all of this I knew he had been talking to Amanda a lot. He and her became FB friends, and she would tag him in posts and stuff. But he didn't become friends with James. He didn't even text James. He had also INFORMED ME that in a few weeks Amanda has a gig, and oh, btw we're going. He didn't ask me, he told me.

Fast forward a few weeks through Christmas, I don't confront him with all this because the holidays are hard on us due to deaths and stressful family. Finally I talk to him about it. 

I tell him I'm not jealous of this girl, just the attention that she gets v.s. me. I tell him I looked at the phone bill and know he texted her first and not me. I explain that this makes me feel like I'm just an after thought and not a priority. He just glares. Then I ask Now, please be honest. Did you ever have dinner with her alone or not? [he had previously told me he was never alone with her] He said YES are you HAPPY?

No you lied to me why did you lie? When did you go with her? Apparently it was the 5 hour dinner from weeks ago. I ask why he lied and his response: Because you're so fucking insecure! You would have been pissed and then you were mad because I was eating and not talking to you so I stayed out because I didn't want to deal with you being upset.

Now, just so you all know, ANYTIME he goes to an event, party, dinner etc with a girl that I have never met, her gender isn't disclosed until the photos appear on FB. He calls them by their last names until I figure out that nope, not a dude but a woman. I have never been told up front about them. So to me it raises suspicion when he doesn't tell me these things, especially due to our past.

After all this is done and the arguments dwindled down, I ask him what he wants to do. He doesn't know. I tell him I would like to go to counseling and work out our issues. He says he doesn't want to have kids and then hate each other later in life. I say I want to work through this and he says he doesn't know what he wants.

I ask if he wants to work on us. He responds I don't know.

Now I don't know what to do. I'm tired of being the only one to try to work on us. I'm tired of his go to answer being I don't know. I'm depressed and he keeps acting like nothings wrong. I'm sick of it and need advice and help.

24326,Dating,3axcud,"I started working as an intern, part-time, in February with a well known tech company. I am in a program where all interns work part-time during the school year and full time during the summer. There were three other interns on my team when I joined, but one I didn't see for a 5 week period because our work schedules never matched up, but we finally met at the start of the new quarter about 12 weeks ago. We both started full time work last week and have really started to get to know each other better. I now accept that I've developed a crush for my coworker.

We talk, joke, and get along well, have been friends on Facebook for a few weeks already, and have started carpooling to work together as of today. There hasn't been any flirting, and all our conversations have really been friendly, but the amount that I think about this person has lead to me believe that I have a serious crush for them. There haven't been any signs of reciprocation (though I am awful at observation), and I know that I am probably reading into things too much (Things like sitting next to each other at lunch, us looking to the other to decide if we want to go to break at the same time, casually chatting over our office instant messaging system). 

I enjoy our relationship, we enjoy similar things and can make each other laugh, and I don't want to ruin it. I also know its a workplace crush, which adds a level of complexity to things. We report to different managers, though we are on the same team. I need to refer to my workplace's guidelines on this type of relationship, which I can only read at work. It's also worth to note that the nature of our employment also carries through beyond this summer (unlike typical programs), so it's safe to assume that both of us will be working together to at least next summer. 

I really like this person, but I need advice on this situation. I am not very experienced with relationships, and I honestly feel that she's out of my league. I believe I could convince myself to put these feelings to rest with time and necessity, but I also think that developing a relationship with this girl might be something special.

The only issue is that when I suggest that we can fix things, all she says is that she doesn't know, rather than being on board with trying to fix it.

TL;DR : My girlfriend got into a fight with me and she thought that I was using her for sex, and that she was losing faith in the relationship. Is there any way to convince her that I am worth staying with and trying to fix things?

I'd ask that you please read that first so you can understand how I hurt her. Thank you :)

So, it's been a little over a month since that incident happened. Well, about two weeks ago she and her friend came to this thing that she knew I was at (because one of our mutual friends told her I'd be there), and we saw each other and talked and she told me that she decided that she wanted to start talking to me again.

So after that night we started to occasionally snapchat and text each other and a couple times I've invited her to hang out and she has. 

I've just been really confused and I don't know what to do. I know I hurt her badly and so I have no idea what she's thinking about me. What I want is to just sink my teeth into her and make her mine already, but I'm afraid to do something too soon.

24351,Breakups,3g9sa1,"My ex-girlfriend, let's call her Mona, broke up with me about 2 months ago after a 5 year relationship, 4 of those year we spent living together.  

5 years ago, I met Mona and was immediately blown away. She was sweet, intelligent, kind, funny, and ridiculously attractive. We hit it off immediately and were smitten with each other. After one year of dating, we moved in with each other. Everyone was great for another year, when something happened seemingly out of the blue.  

We had a healthy sex lifestyle and it wasn't an issue for the first 2 years. Then one night, she stopped me midway through intercourse saying she couldn't do this right now and began crying. Not just sniffling, full blown crying. At the time I didn't know what to do other than be there to comfort her. When she finally settled down, we were tired and just went to bed. The next day we talked about it and she said she didn't know where that crying came from; it simply came out of nowhere.  

Since then, her sex drive plummetted. It wasn't just me; it was just gone. Nothing I tried could get her interested. Every time I wanted to talk about it, she would start crying again and go on about how horrible of a girlfriend she was. I told her she wasn't but I thought we could see help from a doctor and/or therapist. After 6 months of this, she went to her doctor who told her to see a therapist.  

After another few months of therapy, she was diagnosed with depression. Her therapist believed the depression killed her sex drive and was the reason behind her becoming more distant from me. I even sat in on a few of her sessions and also talked to the therapist in private to get their take on what I can do to help Mona through this. 

For the next 2ish years, she went through therapy and was on medication. I took the therapists advice and helped where I could, acknowledging that just being there for the support is probably the best thing that I could do. During this time, sex and emotional intimacy were almost not existent. We had sex maybe 3-4 times total in those years and it felt like she was just going through the motions. Mona grew increasingly emotionally distant from me. I tried everything and was able to stave off showing any of my frustration in front of her, as I didn't want her to feel like this was her fault.  There were times I wondered if the relationship was doomed, but she was my world and I wasn't about to give up or walk away from it. 

A less than a year ago, she turned a corner it seemed. She smiled more often, was a happier person, began trying out new things and found new interests. We traveled more and did more things other than just hanging out on the couch.  

But the emotional distance and lack of sex was still there. By that point I was afraid to bring it up in fear I would trigger another bout of crying.  

Then a few months ago she sat me down and thanked me for sticking with her through all of these years. She apologized for being distant and the lack of sex, saying that she was really feeling like her normal self once again. She also said that since it had been so long that the two of us had any real intimacy, she didn't know how to reignite that passion, and was wanted to work with me on it. She told me I had been her rock and she could have not gotten through this phase of her life without me.  

So we tried. We tried sending each other cute messages throughout the days, taking weekend trips, kissing and holding hands more often. But the more and more we did it, the more and more I felt like I was still initiating everything.  

That's when she broke up with me. She told me that somewhere during her bout of depression, she fell out of being in love with me to just loving me as a person. Basically I was less of a partner and more of just a friend. She again thanked me for always being there for her and that it truly wasn't anything that I had done. Instead, she said she had changed and moved on from us. 

Mona wants to stay in contact with me, but I just don't know if I can. I feel so sad, so betrayed, and so angry. I want no contact with her because of I'm afraid of what I'm going to say to her. I feel used; I feel as if she kept me around just to help her get better. And now that she is better, I'm no longer of use.  

I'm barely holding it together and I'm having such a hard time reconciling all of this. My closest friends know what I'm going through and they're doing what they can. I don't want to turn to alcohol to feel better (my dad did that and I know the consequences; no thanks). I'm having trouble focusing at work and I can't even finish my workouts at the gym.  

Can anyone give me advice? Help me put things into perspective? Is there anything I can do to move on from her other than just give it time? Anything is appreciated; I'm a total wreck right now. I absolutely hate all of these feelings I have.

24356,Dating,1h9539,"Basically, I’m just extremely confused by this whole situation and am needing some guidance. I obviously do like this girl, and wish for things to develop further with her.

Background: She was with a guy for like 4 years and about three weeks ago left him after about a year of not being happy within the relationship. We were in class together and hung out once in a while from mutual friends primarily. I had a crush on her though during this time but she was with that guy for a while so I didn’t think too much into it. There were times where we would smoke up and hang out over the past few months, but never happened much. When they broke up I guess she wasn’t too hurt/upset initially as she had a crush on me – which she said she had for like two months. I didn’t really expect this at all as I have a low image of myself in a lot of ways, but I was told my a few close mutual friends I should go for it, which I did. So about two weeks ago it got really serious where she would invite me over to hang/smoke and we would have sex. 
That lasted about a week of always being together (more due to her inviting me than me organizing this, as I didn’t want to overwhelm her). Then I got hit with a ‘its all hitting me now, its too soon I don’t wanna be in a relationship… I really like you and want to keep hanging out and doing stuff’ message which really hurt due to me actually opening up and really wanting it. 
That night we were supposed to go to a party together but I decided I’d skip out due to the whole preceding message, but then later that night when she was there she would continually text me and obviously hinting at wanting to hang out when she left. I didn’t really respond much as I felt it would make matters more complicated, but she sent the hints, like sending that she could feel better, that shes leaving, followed up directly with the ol’ “….” text which I assume automatically means  
So yeah, after that happened the next day she flat out invited me to stay over that night and that we should cuddle and stuff, so obviously I do since I have nothing better to do. 
Since that I’ve basically been over at her place for two of the past 4 nights, which I find completely fine and not over the top at all.
My big thing is… what is this? She claims that she does like me, that its just too soon, that she doesn’t wanna string me along until she’s ready to give her ‘best’ self out again. We kinda had another talk as I needed a little clarification on the matters at hand. Basically the sparknotes of that were that were me asking if this was just a FWB type situation, so if so I could mentally align myself with that stance, as opposed to allowing myself to get too deep too soon, but she stated that it wasn’t just a physical relationship, that I’m what she wants but shes just not ready.

As I typed more of this out I realized I didn’t have too much of a point for writing this, as its somewhat laid out as to what she wants, I just feel as if I get mixed signals and it confuses me with the emotions I feel as well. Is this just a typical rebound thing for her, and she’s stating niceties but wants to keep me as a fuck buddy, or am I actually seeing the situation right and its just this confusing.

24359,Breakups,2p62zb,"So, to get into more detail on this, me and her moved in together back in June earlier this year. I've known her almost over a year before then, so we're beyond a year and a half of a couple now. Her previous boyfriends scarred her quite a bit sexually. There wasn't any rape, or at least under the standard definition (one touched her when she didn't want it too much and he also masturbated to her, something heavily uncomfortable for her. She used to feel like an object.)

However, with me, we've grown to become strong together. I'm her first serious relationship, down to the core of being as close as we are. I moved out a little earlier this month (December) though, but we believe it to only be temporary. I had a lot of crap going on down here where my family and friends live, and where I used to live before switching my life entirely just to be with her. Now that I'm back here again, we're long distance. It's hard for her, though. She has her brother (who's 34) and his family around, as well as her mom, but she still feels pretty alone. I understand it. I miss her, too. It sucks.

A little after I made it down here, she asked me to promise to NOT masturbate until I went back or declared us done.

You may ask, why?

Because she is incapable of masturbating. She never learned it. She never fully tried it. It's something incomprehensible for her, and she just cannot do it. She wants me to endure the same suffering of sexual frustration while I'm gone,

It was hard for me to make this promise because it was hard to do. I mean, fuck. I've been masturbating since I was 9. It isn't as if I like to do it (as pleasurable as it is), but that I cannot stop myself. I'm addicted to masturbating every now and then. I've made it a life goal when I was younger to never masturbate several times over because I used to think it was a bad thing, so I've been there for a decade. It never worked. If I wanted to stop, I'd need some outside help to do it.

Anyway, I made the promise. I had lack of confidence in that promise, and that was my mistake. I was wrong to make the promise in the first place if I even had the closest gut feeling I couldn't keep it. She seemed pissed though, so I really wanted to make that honest effort to try. Done, promise made.

Over the next few days, I'm resisting pretty damn well. I just avoid the need. Until, well, one day. It hits me a little harder than ever, and I'm doing homework all day long. I need some fucking relief to continue with a clear mindset, and I just couldn't take it. Whacked it in the bathroom, came back out and felt like I just killed a guy. It sucked, but I took a deep breath and thought, Well, I'll just try to not do it again from here.

Yeah, right. It continues. I don't tell her, my biggest mistake.

She eventually asks me if I've been masturbating, and I couldn't lie if being asked at the very least. I admit that I have been, but only to her. She seemed unhappy over Skype, turned away for a bit. I tried smoothing it out and explaining that something like this was just a serious problem for me, and that if I wanted to stop, I needed some help. It's harder for me as a guy who's done it like all my life compared to a girl who just recently started to enjoy pleasure. I say that because she hardly cared before me. I'm that good apparently, or her previous guys were total crap.

She hangs up Skype. Bad.

I try calling her some more. Nothing. Send a couple Skype messages. She calls me after a few, and she's prepared.

We fight. Long story short, she didn't like my reasoning. She called me selfish for masturbating when she cannot, an asshole for breaking the promise, and just hurtful for not understanding how strongly she feels towards male desires.

I forgot to mention that. She hates guys because they look at girls like sex objects. It makes anything sexual hard and fatal. I over the year eased her into things a little better, so just with me, she doesn't care as much. This is besides the point.

We argue more via Skype chat instead of call, but I try to remain civilized while she's cursing me out. I tell her what I told you guys about how long I've been fighting masturbation, including trying to hurt my dick when I was little. It's actually a pretty sensitive topic. After she chooses to believe nothing else except that I have the power to alone do something about it (which I seriously believe I would need help with, just like any other addict of any matter), there's eventually a gap of her being offline.

Uhh...

She comes back, is typing sophisticated and robotic-like the entire time. She tells me she's now closed off herself and is letting darkness swallow her. Wonderful. I tell her my apologies over breaking the promise, not telling her, MAKING the promise in the first place if I couldn't follow through, and being selfish. What I could not apologize for was my disability to control it for too long and told her I could use help. She still disregards how serious this is for me. 

Anyway, back to the darkness thing, I tell her that's a poor answer to this, and she disagrees. She thinks darkness and killing her emotions just makes things limitless because nobody stands in the way.

I tell her that I'm still here, even if she's done with me. She disagrees, thinking that someone like me who cannot understand her pain isn't someone who's there for her or really loves her. I told her that we should just go to sleep and get a break from each other for the night to think things over and speak more reasonably tomorrow, but she's had it. She decides that I'm scum, and uh, she's done with me. Gets off Skype.

I've been gone for not even 2 weeks and she's broken up with me 3 times (though this time is a little more serious. She was just upset about minor things the other times and we made up like nothing.) so I lack confidence that we can proceed. I can't normally figure out how to fix things with my life and live normally down here before returning home, while she can barely stay sane with me not there. I can't support such destruction since it isn't healthy for either of us.

By the way, I also think she's freaking out a little too much about the masturbation thing, but I want more opinions on that. Am I wrong for masturbating SIMPLY for the relief of needing to do it, and because I can't help it? I honestly would get help if that would mean fixing things, but she doesn't even want to understand that I feel I need it. She thinks everyone is strong. I'm not. I've tried to be, but I need help.

Another question: Do I even need to seek help for something like masturbation? I assumed it's normal. I don't fucking know what's going on, Reddit. It's 7:30 AM and I haven't slept yet. What a wonderful Saturday. Let me know what you guys think.

24360,Dating,1xvbcv,"When my now-best-friend and I first met we became very close friends very quickly. I really felt like I could be myself with her in a way I've never felt with anyone else before. We talked a lot about sex and relationships, but just in a friendly way, and she even helped me kind of figure out what I was looking for in a girl. Turns out, she's exactly what I'm looking for, except one big thing. I'm just really not physically attracted to her.

After a little while, it became pretty clear to me that she was interested in maybe taking our relationship further, but I basically turned her down. I gave her a few very true reasons, like that I was really worried about messing up our friendship and I had reservations about dating anyone I worked with (which we did at the time). I didn't say anything about the lack of attraction, but I'm afraid she might have sensed it to some extent.

Anyway, I knew that I loved her in some way, but as time has gone on I've been thinking more and more that it could in fact be romantic love. What has really been doing it for me lately is that we've both gone back to school and she started dating someone else so I haven't been seeing much of her at all. I guess it's one of those things of not knowing what I had til it was gone or something. (And in terms of her seeing someone else right now, I know it wouldn't be a great idea to try and get in the middle of that, and I don't intend to. But I also know that things haven't been going great for them so I don't see them lasting too much longer.)

A few other things sort of add to my problem of how to deal with this. Basically without turning this into a novel, I'm a bit... unusual, and she not only isn't bothered by it, she seems to actually like me for it (another first for me). I'm also looking for something pretty specific in a woman that I think is pretty unusual and she fits the bill pretty much exactly. Those things make me pretty worried that I'm not likely to find anyone else like her...

Then lastly, I have my own personal issue with feeling like a shallow asshole for turning her down for her looks, but I think I've largely gotten over that. The biggest hang up I have now is that I don't know how a relationship could work when I couldn't honestly tell her that I found her beautiful. She would absolutely see right through me if I tried to be anything but honest. I've been in love for real once before (or at least I think so) and I was able to honestly tell that girl that I thought she was the most beautiful girl in the world.

This has really been tearing me up lately. Like I said, being so separated from her lately has made me realize how badly I want her in my life, but I don't know how we could make a real relationship work if the physical attraction isn't there.

My former pot smoking was pretty much what ended things, not because i did it but i lied to her about it.

The night she broke up with me devastated me and it took me a long time to get over her. She told me she didn't want to be friends and she thought i should really get over her. I don't think i was completely over her until April which was 4 months after the break up. I did a lot of soul searching during the break up period and really found that i was at fault for a lot of things and she was at fault for a lot of things. So i'm saying i wasn't self loathing the whole time. I cut off all communication from her except block her number, i did delete it though. I did have some hook ups after i got over her, not sure why i put that in there but just to let you guys know that i wasn't constantly pining over her.

Fast forward to this past Sunday. I get a text message from a number i don't recognize and it was asking why they can't send pics from snapchat. I wasn't sure who it was so i asked Who is this. They replied in a snappy manor with Yeah i bet you don't know who this is. After i told this person to stop playing games and tell me who it is, she replied her name. At first i shook my head and was gonna blow her off but i decided to talk to her, i mean hell i am over her so what could this hurt? We have been talking for the past couple days until today when she asked me something.

Whatever you do, promise me, you won't get attatched.

I said Ok i'm fine with that. This got a response, What does that mean. I called her and told her over the phone that anything I'm about to say may hurt but its the God's honest truth. I told her exactly how i felt. I told her i was devastated the night she broke up with me. I told her i was completely over her and am more than willing to be friends. I told her that i don't ever see us being more that friends, for the wellness of my mental health. I told her i was not the same person she knew before we started dating or the guy she knew when we were dating. I told her the break up really changed me to the point i am happy. I was happy with her but im much happier now, without her. 

This caused her to cry and tell me she is fine. I know damn well she was hurt and she told me she didn't wanna talk right now, which is fine by me. I'd love to be her friend because in my mind she would make a much better friend than a girlfriend.

My mom let my sister stay home instead of going to school today, and we made sure my dad didn't know about it because he definitely would have forced her to go. When I got home, my sister told me she had something really important to tell me.

She told me that she saw and heard the other woman, and heard/can infer that they did the deed. I thought she was joking at first, since this kind of thing is pretty much unheard of in our family. My parents are first generation Asian immigrants, and we both kind of assumed this would never be a problem for us.

Then she showed me the pictures and recordings she took for evidence. She took them with her iPod camera, so they were blurry, but it showed the woman parking in front of our house and coming in. She also wrote down the woman's license plate number. 

The voice recordings were full of static, but you can hear the woman speaking in our parents' asian language and at one point in the recording you could hear her say the word husband. Most of it was hard to decipher though.

My sister also said that she heard dad and the woman going into mom and dad's bedroom. They stayed in there for a long time and she could hear grunting noises from there.

She said that she was okay and that she didn't love dad anyway. (Which we sort of knew. Their relationship wasn't very passionate.) But mom said she would ignore it to not cause trouble. 

Mom said that she had no idea about this before this. Also, she was acting really cheerful to me today. It's her way of ignoring the problem.

We also have a little brother in middle school who has had some issues with depression. We haven't told him about it. My dad also has no idea we know. 

So Reddit, my question is what should I do? I can add details about my parents' relationship, about my dad, about my mom, etc. if you want. (Some of it might actually be important.) I really just do not know what to do. Should I convince mom to get a divorce? Should we confront dad? Should we tell my little brother? Please help me, Reddit.

**tl;dr**: My dad is cheating and we don't know what to do.

Edit: Thank you for the advice. My sister and I will do our best not to get involved from this point on. However, and I don't know if this is significant, but my mom is very passive and my dad is very dominant in the family. Whatever he says goes and my mom has pretty much no say whatsoever. She can't even buy something for herself with her own money (both parents work full time) without my dad making a big deal. My mom always backs off and just goes with what he says.

24365,Breakups,2n5n4h,"I've (27f) been dating my boyfriend (28M) now for 9 months and have been exclusive for 8 months.  I have had several different boyfriends over the years and have only had 3 what I would consider LTR, even though the longest of each of those was around the 1 year mark.  I freely admit to having commitment anxiety.

However for him I have really truly been trying to make sure that I don't do my normal freak out when things start getting comfortable as I've never really felt like this for anyone before.  I don't know if its my age or if I'm changing or if its him but I actually have started envisioning a family and a long life together.  

He on the other hand has only ever had 2 relationships with the last one lasting 5 years.  It didn't work out between them and they parted amicably according to her.  He never talks about her nor are there any photo's of her that I've seen.

Well fuck me if I didn't meet her tonight at the most inopportune time.  The Hospital he works at (he is a Radiologist) had a formal black tie dinner benefit and auction for one of their clinics.  He invited and of course I was more than happy to go as I don't get to break out the little black dress that often.  However today was just not my day for my hair and I, which is another story altogether.

We go and are sitting at a table with several of his co-workers when in comes this absolutely stunning woman wearing a gorgeous white dress and 4 inch heels.  The only thing missing was her crown and sash.

Every guy's head turned towards her and more than one guy got elbowed by their s/o for staring to long.  Low and behold the princess comes to our table and embraces my b/f.  After what seemed like forever my b/f finally gets around to introducing me to her.

Have you ever felt like a toad before in public, well I can tell you right now I felt like the ugly toad that somehow escaped the swamp.

After faking friendly feeling towards each other she turns and goes back to her table.  Obviously my b/f didn't need to tell me but he did anyway, this was his ex.

Good God talk about taking ones self esteem and chucking it in the trash can.  She dresses like a queen and looks like Charlize Theron.

Ugh....

He is asleep now and all I can do is sit here and worry all night about how badly I compare to her.  Now I am paranoid that I am the booby prize because she might have dumped him.  I know this is crazy and I'm trying to get these thoughts out of my head while he is sleeping as he has done nothing wrong and even made extra sure that I was okay after she left because I think he could see how rattled she made me.

But for the love of all that is holy why did she have to look like that?  I mean I could handle her being a normal looking woman, I'm not a 10 or anything but I think I hold my own.  But she is a 10, hell an 11 if there was such a thing.

Anyone have any advice how to get this out of my head?  Right now I'm bouncing between trying to improve my looks in some fashion to cutting off all my hair and just ware a bag around the house in a show of complete and utter defeat.

24371,Dating,200zbc,"I have been with my girlfriend for 2 years and we have been friends for a few years before that. We started dating about 6 months after her divorce and I have few complaints. We communicate openly and frequently about most issues and regularly discuss our relationship. Having both been married before, we're using that experience to make this relationship healthier.

The problem that brings me to reddit is one that I have a hard time talking to her about. She has an almost complete lack of confidence. Decisions are almost impossible for her and frequently lead to feelings of regret and shame. Even something as simple as picking a meal at a restaurant tends to lead to I wish I would have gotten ____ instead-type conversations. I've been supportive and actively tried to offer reassurance that her decision was a good one. This seems to have a pacifying effect, but doesn't help the initial regret she feels. I've tried making recommendations based on her tastes, but this only worked for a while. She disliked feeling submissive and wanted to live with her own decisions (yes, we're still talking about dinner here...).

Bigger decisions place an even bigger load on her. I can see the dread that comes with the prospect of buying furniture, or signing an apartment lease. God help us all if she has to decide on health insurance packages at a new job. 

She has always had these personality traits, but I'm just now (past 6 months) seeing how much it weighs on her. She's miserable when we try to decide where to go on vacation. I love her and really enjoy our time together, and it pains me to think that so much of it is time she's spending feeling bad. I an happy to reassure, console and generally be emotionally supportive, but I think there is a balance that needs to be maintained. 

I honestly don't relate to the feelings she has, so I'm at a loss for how to help. I'm interested in finding out if anyone else has had experience like this themselves and what line I should take to try and help her through this. I'm an engineer, so emotional issues sometimes are outside of my grasp, but I feel like this one is beyond what most people experience.

I'm happy to fill in any gaps I may have left. This is a throwaway, so be patient for me, I can't check too frequently.

24376,Dating,27xjzy,"I [23 M] was set up by a friend (who we will call Jane) with a mutual friend [24 F] (who we will call Abby) of ours two weeks ago. The girl and I have known each other since January of this year and have hung out in small and large groups of people a few times since then. She had a boyfriend from February to May, so while I always had interest in her, I never really was able to ask her out.

Two weeks ago, I spoke to Jane about Abby and told her how I felt about her, and she recommended that we all go out for drinks (the three of us, plus another guy friend of mine). So, we went on somewhat of a double-date two weeks ago, and Abby's birthday had just passed, so I paid for all of her drinks. We all hung out a little while after the drinks, and then I walked Abby home. At her doorstep we kissed for a while, I got her number, and headed home. 

Since we saw each other, we texted daily for about 5-6 days (without me asking her on another date- Jane told me not to ask her out just yet because she was having a tough time at work adjusting to her recent breakup- she works with her ex-boyfriend.) Our texts were very long (sometimes a paragraph each), which was coming from both her and me, and she definitely appeared interested in talking. 

Sometimes though, she wouldn't text back a question, or anything that invited further conversation. That is totally fine by me. The annoying part of my brain though is telling me that if she isn't asking questions back, or continuing the conversation then maybe she isn't interested? 

Anyway, I asked her out to dinner, and the first time either of us could agree upon (we're both in the medical field, so she's extremely busy with her professional life, as am I, but we both expressed strong interest in seeing each other for the date) is next Friday. She also said she's excited for the date. 

Since we set the date though, we've been talking less frequently, and I don't always want to be initiating contact, because I don't want to seem like a pain to her. I also don't want her to think I'm not interested in talking to her, and given that we aren't seeing each other for over a week, I feel like it would be odd not to talk during that time.

Does anyone have recommendations on how to stay in touch (how often really, and should I always be initiating?) between now and the date?

Thanks so much!

During the rest of the relationship however she was constantly making me feel bad for messing around behind her back and calling me a liar.

24389,Breakups,2qrbkq,"Background: Met her through her mom and step dad whom I work with but knew her mom a year before I met her as she lived with her dad (divorced) at the time a few hours away. When she moved to her moms she came to visit us at work and about a year and a half later here we are. We have been very close spending time together usually daily since we started dating. I am also close with her mom and step dad because of work. She's very attractive, funny, and we share a ot of the same interests.

Now: Mid-October I suffered a stroke the origin was suspected from my heart and I had to undergo a form of Cardiac catheterization two weeks ago. The stroke was very minor I have always been in good shape stayed active and ate pretty healthy. Yet it still took me out of work for the time being due to some vision loss. At first, everything was ok she was helpful and tried not to get frustrated. No money mo problems as for the Holiday season she wanted to constantly do all sorts of things and I did not as I had to lay low from the surgery anyways and haven't worked for two months which I think really upset her but at the same time it was hard to be in the Holiday spirit anyway. 

The arguments got worse and worse as we spent so much time together, because she didn't want to work nearly as much so that she could spend time with me. Sooner than later we were arguing almost daily over the most pointless things because the stress of everything that occurred along with just way too much time to waste together. After the cardiac surgery, I went into my recovery room and had an unexpected seizure and went unconscious. This made my mom and dad very nervous as the procedure took longer than it was supposed to as well. After that when I regained consciousness my girlfriend wouldn't even look at me she stood in the corner of the room with her arms folded and looked pissed off. She continued to have an attitude all day and night but said that someone annoyed her and that it was my mom because all my mom talked about while I was in surgery was how she was worried something went wrong. WTF?! I think that is a legitimate worry but brushed it off because I wanted to focus on recovery. Arguments continued because its just not the same anymore because of the medical issues with me. 

And now fast forward two weeks later now she drops the bomb on me that the person that annoyed her during the surgery was actually her ex because he text her that day. And that it bothered her that she still cared about what he had to say and then said she just doesn't know what she wants. Said that she had felt this way now since this happened but wanted to stick around through the surgery so that I would have someone there for me. I obviously haven't been too happy with it either but it hasn't been the top priority as recovery and getting things back to normal has been. A couple of days ago she brought up her ex and talked about how she doesn't know what to do, on top of everything else it really just made me angry more than upset so we talked and decided to take a break although this break seems like it may need to just be a break up at this point. I do love her but sometimes wonder if we're really compatible anyways and with the timing of this and how she has handled it idk if it is worth trying to continue.

24390,Breakups,1ohus1,"This is really long. It's about two sad people. I hope someone reads it.

   I met D about a year ago. Both liked each other, never said anything about it (which was strange for me, I usually go for what I want). Stopped talking because he lost his phone. Fast forward a year, we reconnect, start hanging out immediately. After a couple weeks the sexual tension was too strong, decided to be friends with benefits. After a few weeks we both get attached. I know we are young, but I've been in a couple relationships.. it never hit me like this before. 

   So here we are, both happy, everything is perfect, we both think we're in love. But he has problems with his past - he's obsessed with it, with what he could have done, he just blames himself for his life being shit now. Weirdly enough, before we reconnected, we both had a terrible year. We were both depressed.. I dropped out of college, so did he, both with no jobs. I went on medication and got better (my state was a bit more severe, at least he could still function, somewhat). I got a job and so did he, and after finding each other things literally turned around. If you have ever experienced depression, this is not a huge deal.. this is THE deal. Finding happiness for a depressed person is like finding a unicorn.. seems totally impossible. But to find someone that makes you truly happy, takes you out of that dark whole.. why would you ever hold back on that? No boyfriend ever did that for me. I lied to myself so I could think I was happy, but I always knew the truth. I wasn't. But not with D.. he's real, real happiness. I honestly believe I fell in love, and so does he.

   I know you will all think this is crazy but, he proposed to me. Let me just say that before I started seeing him this year again, I had just broken up with someone that treated me like a queen but was unfortunately just not compatible. I loved his person, but I didn't love him as a partner. He is the one person I can say has truly ever loved me, no doubt, but he wasn't what I wanted. So after breaking his heart, I became even more heartless myself (hated myself for leaving such a good guy, thought I didn't deserve love) and decided to enjoy the single life. I only wanted physical satisfaction from now on. D wanted to do the same thing, and that's why it was easy for us to start sleeping together. 

   Never did we imagine.. I said yes of course. We got engaged. For the first time in my short life, I didn't want to die - I wanted to live for him (I have been struggling with depression for years, and all I've ever wanted was to stop suffering, a way out). But then the relationship slowly deteriorated. Yes, on a regular basis, we'd have an amazing time, just pure bliss, but then.. I couldn't stand him anymore. Everything he did, I got upset about. I think he needs to grow up, act more his age, stop being so needy. I hate that I have to tell him what to do, but otherwise.. he doesn't do it. I hate that he's selfish and not thoughtful (although when we were just sleeping together, he was the most caring, thoughtful, and sweetest guy. Hence why I fell in love). He got comfortable. He got used to it, thought he didn't need to put in work anymore. But that's not how a relationship works. It needs to grow strong, and that can only happen if both partners agree to work on it.

   I even noticed it in the sex. D is the only person that has made me orgasm from penetration, he has taken me places I have never been, everything was great, best sex of both our lives, shit, we made love, the best kind.. but lately it's just been feeling like regular sex. The love and passion that was there is not there anymore. It is, but it's barely there. And that's how he's been about everything. Apathetic. Doesn't care.. his job makes him miserable, so I've been trying to be patient. But I need to receive as much love as I give, so it's hard..

Last weekend, he got drunk at a friend's get together.. he didn't pay much attention to me. I was ignored most of the night. At some point, I was standing literally right in front of him, waiting for him because I had asked if he could walk me to the car at night so I could go grab something. He didn't look at me once and kept talking to a mutual girl friend instead (whom he kinda had a crush on last year). This made me really sad.. we talked about it and he apologized, said he didn't notice what he was doing, I said ok, let it go. The very next day he takes me to his friend's birthday party and does the same thing. Gets drunk and ignores me for most of the night. I didn't really know anyone, I tried to be social, but all couples were together and everyone else was kinda doing their own thing. I felt so left out. D kept checking on me throughout the night are you ok baby? I just wanna make sure you're having a good time was what he'd say, and then leave after 5-10 min to go hang out with his friends (mostly with a guy who he supposedly was mad at, so I was thinking to myself, wtf? but he cant hang out with his fiancee?). Of course I didn't want to make a scene, and I tried to convince myself I was overreacting, so I'd always just say yeah. I'm fine. But I really just wanted him to include me in his little group. I understand guys need their guy time, but if he wants to marry me.. why can't I be part of his fun? I didn't expect him to be with me the whole night, but I was ALONE. I knew no one, and he didn't seem to care. Seemed like he forgot about me. Also, he kept talking to a girl.. that had a boyfriend glued to her the whole night. The three of them are friends, but honestly, he talked to her more than he did to me. 

   Typing this out is making me feel like a jealous freak, but I can't help how I feel. I broke up with him because after that night I really just felt truly unloved. I have done nothing but be the best girlfriend I can be. He knows it, and he admits it, and whenever we tried to talk he'd just shut down and have nothing to say because, according to him, I'm right. He thinks he's a piece of shit boyfriend. I don't agree, he hurts me without knowing it.. but maybe I'm just being blind? I do a lot for him on a regular basis (Take him/pick him up from work, run his errands, cook for him a couple nights out of the week, anything he needs..) I'm constantly showing my love. But he stopped talking to me, I never know what he's thinking. The only reason I am asking for advice is because he has never purposely hurt me. He has expressed to me that he feels depressed and hopeless, he doesn't know where he's going with life. So I'm just here wondering if maybe this is why he's been more distant and not caring? I know what it's like.. I have been there.. but then again, when he's around everyone else, he acts normal. Lively, like nothing's wrong. I feel like there can be two sides to this: either he's depressed, loves me, but doesn't know how to go about his life.. or.. he's secretly manipulative and I'm just a sucker. I know we are both ridiculously young, and I know probably 99% of the time, people my age are wrong about love. I never believed in fairy tales, seriously.. I consider myself a logical, realistic person with common sense. But ever since he came into my life, everything.. EVERYTHING changed. I don't know who I am anymore. He is my air. I don't understand.. I know I honestly love him and want nothing more than to be with him.. and that is all I know.. I don't need him to do things for me I just want to know he loves me and is not just comfortable with having me around. I want to know he's not using me. But how can I know when he doesn't express himself??

I love her.  She was my best friend, and I don't see any good reason for it to end.  This is the only relationship I've ever been in.  I was closer to her than anyone I've ever known.  And, our friendship didn't dwindle or anything.  It just ended so suddenly for seemingly very superficial reasons.  How can I move on when I don't want to move on?

I'm pretty sure the only reason she broke up with me is that when she thought about staying with me, it made her feel trapped and limited, and when she thought about breaking up with me, it made her feel like there were endless possibilities and adventures awaiting her.  We've all felt that feeling.  I don't even think she had felt it for very long.  She told me she might have been feeling this way for a month.  It's just a mental trick.  I used to feel that way as a little kid, when I imagined getting married.  It's pure fantasy.

Meanwhile, the biggest problem with our relationship was that she was a workaholic, working every day of the week, working at home after work, never taking vacation days, never taking sick days.

I tried telling her all this, but she denied it.  She couldn't resist the allure of those endless adventures that her imagination promised were awaiting her in her new life without me.

She ended up quitting her job right after we broke up.  She also said a bunch of stuff about why she was breaking up that sounded so hollow that I can't take it seriously.  She told me that I didn't have any aspirations.  Then, went and did the very thing that I aspired to do.  See, when we broke up, I started working on turning a large box van into a camper that I could take around the country to all the best rock climbing destinations.  I tried to get her to do it with me while we were still together, but she was too involved with her job.  Then, after she quit her job, someone just gave her a camper, and she moved to some climbing destination.  

She also refused to talk to me about anything.  Like, our nine year relationship came to an end without even a real discussion.  It's crushing.  Then, I read about dead bedrooms, people who grow to hate each other, people who can't stand to be together, people who are constantly breaking up and getting back together, people who have terrible fights, and our relationship was nothing like that.  Yet, those people all try to make it work, try to fix things.

She told me that we had tried everything to fix things.  I told her that I thought that we had tried nothing.  I asked for an example, and she told me that she had always made sure to give me a hug when she came home from work.  That's it.  That's her idea of trying everything to fix things.  She's so naive, childlike, and impulsive.  She told me that she couldn't believe that people kissed on the first date.  She also told me that she wanted me to date other people, in the first month after we had broken up.  Like, I was just supposed to start immediately dating other people, after my world had just collapsed.  How am I supposed to respect her decisions when she's making them in that kind of a mindset?  I don't know if she's really like that, and has been hiding her true self from me this entire time, or if she had a nervous breakdown or something.

I know there are things I could have done better.  I see them, now.  But, I'm willing to do the work and to change what I need to change, and I told her that.

I'm sure much of that was due to his culture (living together before marriage is a HUGE no no, although his family was very tolerant), military upbringing,  money constraints, housing, and he was working VERY hard to provide for all of us financially) however, in my eyes he was far too strict over little things. 

 I was very  intimidated by his strong opinions and his conviction that he was Right with a capital R, and I usually just ended up crying after trying (and failing) to speak up for myself. Not to mention we had some serious issues with my would be (step) mother in law (he is from a different culture). It was very difficult for my child and I as he grew increasingly controlling, strict, unreasonable and uncommunicative.  I grew incrrasingly reclusive (hiding from that damn mother in law), cried a lot (that didnt help... I am very much a cryer and he was not used to that kind of reaction... although he never yelled at me, I know he and his ex used to have screaming fights..  maybe he just expected a much more forceful attempt when I needed something, but he just ended up thinking I was weak, and i just thought he would never listen. I ended up deciding to leave and have been gone for about 6 months. 

He was very helpful in helping me get back on my feet when i left. After an intial month and a half of begging me to come back he has pretty much left me alone except for checking in at holidays, sending my things, and also a few gifts.

24396,Breakups,33htp8,"We are college seniors, ready to graduate in a couple weeks. We have been together since freshman year and have been attached at the hip. He is often dependent on me for transportation, and starting in August, living arrangements. I have been feeling scared of commitment to moving in together, which ties into how I'm feeling after this accident.


He was never pushed by his family to get a drivers license and was always afraid of driving until I encouraged him to get his license freshman year. Since getting his license he is hesitant to contribute to the driving involved during commutes or long weekend road trips. I am generous with my car and accommodate his transportation needs, especially when visiting his family back home, who never help with transporting him to and from our college town (about 1.5 hr drive). I often feel like I am supporting his lifestyle and he has become dependent on me for these things.


Because he's afraid to drive, he hasn't driven enough or learned to be a better driver. And then he is more afraid to drive (feedback loop). He really wanted to see a concert in the major city over (about 1.5hr car ride) on a school night and off a traffic-heavy interstate. Often I feel pressured to see concerts with him, which he goes to nearly three or four times per month. I am more of a homebody. I was stressed out from work/school that night and reluctant to go in the first place, so I wanted him to drive home. At first he refused, but then I guilted him into driving because I feel I always drive.


He used his turn signal to merge left, but he failed to check his blind spots. He claims to have checked his mirrors. We hit the driver to our left as he was merging, we swerveed to the right, and then he overcorrected to the left, sending our car into an out of control tail spin. By some miracle we were not T-boned by oncoming traffic, which we were perpendicular to at this point. He drives the car to the median and we are both fine, thank goodness.


While the accident was his fault, they find that the other driver was wasted and unlicensed. She is arrested. My boyfriend is meanwhile relieved. My car is in okay shape and drivable but I am cautious and have it towed (the other party's car was totaled). The tow truck guy starts making conversation with us. I am tense and serious, don't want to shoot the shit with anybody at this moment, but my boyfriend immediately engages in conversation about the accident and how it wasn't his fault because the other driver was drunk. He also flows from his natural speaking voice to a more casual one, including more swear words and such, blending into the tone of the tow truck driver. I am sitting there seething about how blase my boyfriend is being about this accident.


I feel that I can't trust him with driving places. I want an equal who I can trust with anything, and especially being a woman, I tend to want the man to drive and be confident in taking care of us. I am generally very non-gender normative in this scenarios, but I want my partner to at least pull equal share of the driving. I was beginning to trust that he could drive us safely.


On top of these issues, I don't feel challenged by him. We get along great and click amazingly. We can banter for hours together and not get sick of each other. My family loves him. However, he is often not very ambitious in aspects of personal growth and career ambition, which I value and practice in my own life. I also get a sense that I am not well liked by his mother because I am not a southern conservative (I am a liberal from the northeast). My boyfriend does not often stand up to his family on issues concerning me, and I feel this speaks to his overall maturity level.


I have attempted to break up with him in the past, but he always begs me not to, that he will never find someone like me, that he will be lost without me. I am personally a thick-skinned person. I lost my mother to cancer a couple years ago. Breaking up is low on the list of personal struggles, in my opinion. This coming year I will be starting a PhD program and am looking forward to meeting new people and working on my personal hobbies. I want to be completely selfish, and I feel I have given so much to my boyfriend that I have been unable to focus on my goals.


He did help me through my mother's death and is incredibly kind, patient, and supportive. I don't think I could have found a better first love. But all of these feelings I have been getting have culminated in last night's events. I feel very clear headed with how I want to draw the line in my life. I don't want him to convince me to stay based on how he feels. I want to be selfish, even if that means breaking his heart. I want to see other, more mature people. I want an equal who will challenge me. 


When I have brought these issues up in the past he has mentioned my shortcomings as a person and how I'm not exactly perfect. And that always stops me and I push my feelings under the rug. I want to make it stick this time, I want to move on to someone as ambitious and growth oriented as I am, even if that means lonely nights at home with my guinea pigs. After this incident I have realized I need to break up, but he had the opposite reaction: he can't imagine living without me.


I don't know what to do. I am so stressed out. Graduation should be a happy time in our lives. Also, I don't want to completely blame this car accident for the breakup. My feelings towards it are more of a symptom than the cause. I feel that if I was really happy in this relationship I would be less focused on blame and more focused on our safety and being together after this scary event. I don't want to completely scar him from driving ever again and ruin his psyche, especially in regards to the weaknesses I find in him, which he is cognizant of and is often ashamed of. But all of his feelings shouldn't have to negate my feelings.


   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend got us into a very serious car accident and threatened our lives. I feel like he is too dependent on me and hasn't properly learned adult skills (such as proper driving).

Kate's not a 10, but she's incredibly attractive to me. I've always thought that and I've had the occasional fantasy about the two of us. I never wanted to pursue it though, as we see each other all the time and I felt like it would mess up the group dynamic. We're very close friends and hang out a lot.

About a month ago, Kate and I hung out one-on-one and had a very long, deep conversation. We covered everything from past relationships to belief systems, and really just bonded quite a lot. When I left her place I realized I had a crush on her. It isn't an intense, I'm in love with you kind of crush, but I certainly have feelings for her.

Now I haven't had a crush on a friend since I was in middle school--I usually try very hard to keep friendships and dating separate. But now it's a bit harder to keep those feelings to myself. We're only a week away from the semester ending and subsequently my going home, but I feel like I still want to pursue something with her. My worries are that

a.) If I tell her how I feel, and she doesn't reciprocate, our close friendship and our group dynamic will be messed up.

b.) If I don't say anything, I'll regret it and miss her over the summer.

Ultimately I could just let it go and let the feelings dissolve over time but it's not something I want to give up on. Is it worth it to try and start something now, as close as I am to leaving town, or should I keep it to myself and wait to see if I continue to have these feelings? Also we will see each other some over the summer because of road trips. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

24406,Breakups,3eb6st,"My girlfriend and I have always been really close in our relationship, but lately she has been increasingly unstable and this morning it all culminated. In the past, she has spent extravagant amounts of money on drugs, to the point that she has tried to hide it from me. Last night she got more, and asked me to do some with her. I said no, maybe another day and she refused to talk to me the rest of the night apart from telling me she wanted to die after going to do some herself. 

This morning she wanted to do it again and I told her I wasn't comfortable with her doing that again, and since this has been a recurring issue I told her she may have a problem. I asked her to choose between the drugs and me - which in retrospect was not a good choice, because she chose the drugs. In my continuing stupidity, I ended up preparing to leave but couldn't find my wallet. She went ballistic when I tried to find it, screaming horrible things at the top of her lungs, threatening to call the police, threatening to hurt herself and me, and more. 

I ended up leaving as I didn't really have a choice, and am now sitting in my car wondering what I can do. I still love her, I know she hasn't slept properly in days and is really stressed out. Is there anything I should do at this point?

24410,Breakups,325mnh,"His last relationship was 7 years. She cheated and he left. He took a year away and dated casually during that time. Then we met and things went really quickly and intensely. He pushed for things to move quickly and then would back away. It made me get weird and eventually we started arguing. The arguing became unbearable and we agreed to take some time apart (just a week) when we met up after the week he said he needed to take things slowly and was afraid of the unhealthy fighting but wanted to make it work. He said he wasn't interested in anyone and wouldn't date anyone but wanted to start at square one. After a week he was distant but sweet and we hooked up like normal. Several days later he calls to say that he's too overwhelmed. That he cares but he doesn't think he feels like he should and he wants to end it.

24417,Dating,2nk5iu,"We started dating about a month ago and hit it off like crazy. I've dated many girls but never felt this type of connection before. We already talk like we've known each other for years, and literally everything, from attraction to communication, is 100% mutual. Well, at least I thought it was until today, when I got my first warning sign that things might not be as perfect as I thought they were.

We took our first vacation together last weekend to a resort a few hours away. We spent the night and everything went pretty much perfect as expected. This was the first time we slept together, and she wound up staying over my place the following night too, which was completely spontaneous and unplanned.

After she left the next day, we talk again a few hours later, when she says to me in a super sexy voice, I'm so happy we finally did it. I can't stop thinking about you... and things like that. I tell her the feelings are mutual and I can't wait to see her again.

Then came Monday morning, and from then til now, it feels like the switch just flipped off. Sure, we've had a few quick text exchanges and 1 short phone conversation, but it just doesn't compare to how it was going before our vacation. We would text a lot and talk every day, sometimes for hours on end.

Then today, after a few more quick texts, her last one said she was just finishing up a couple things and she'd call me in a bit :) at around 9pm.

Then, nothing. It's now 2am and I still haven't even gotten a text to say gnite or anything. What makes it so hard for me is the fact that I've told her the one thing that is my biggest turn-off when it comes to women is flakiness. I'm cool if you have other things to do, just communicate with me and let me know what's up. Don't blow me off. Well, she blew me off.

So, what do I do? Just move forward and act like nothing is wrong? Or do I make her aware that I've noticed things are off lately? How to I regain that spark and go back to the way things were before?

24427,Infidelity,2ufz71,"Hi /r/relationships. I apologize for the length. I haven't had the opportunity to go into detail with a neutral third party. 

My gf and I had been dating semi long distance through college, and we were both in our third year. We saw each other about every other weekend, and more frequently in the summers. We had become very close and serious about our relationship and long term plans. We talked about marriage, children, careers, and everything in between. I didn't expect to fall in love the way I did. I actually didn't think I would seriously date people until later in life, but I am extremely compatible with this girl. We planned for her to move in with me after she graduates, and we would start our lives together. 

So this situation started about 6 months ago. She became friends with this guy Adam, who was in her classes in university. They would hang out frequently, and while I might have been a little suspicious, I didn't think there was a real problem. One night I happened to look over her shoulder and see her delete messages from Adam. I asked her why she felt the need to do that. She said she didn't have a reason to delete messages from Adam, and that she probably did it to clear up space on her phone. I knew this was bullshit, and it ruined my evening and it was when I really started becoming suspicious. 

During this time, my girlfriend mentioned a few times that she wasn't completely happy. She said she didn't feel appreciated sometimes, and that I didn't recognize her achievements. I think she felt this way because I didn't communicate with words how I felt about her often enough. I also had a few small fuck ups like not celebrating valentines day. I did, however, feel very strongly for her, and I felt that I showed it.

So they end up texting, snapchatting, and hanging out way too much for my comfort. I ignore it mostly until I decided to snoop one day, and found evidence. They exchanged flirty messages, told each other that they loved each other etc. I was incredibly pissed off. This all happened at her best friend's wedding. I was tempted to just leave, but I stuck it out. We talked after the wedding. I told her she had to choose between me and the other guy, and she went home and came back the next day saying that she couldn't make that choice and that I should care about her happiness. We somehow came to the conclusion that we would go on a break, even though I was thinking that I had no other choice other than breaking up with her. This was right before she was leaving with her classmates to go on a school function for a few days. So during this break she sits beside Adam on the bus, and they spend a lot of time together. I don't think they did anything physical, but I realize that I basically gave her a free pass to emotionally cheat on me.

She comes back from the trip. I hadn't communicated with her most of this time. I intended on breaking up with her when we met. She apologized, and seemed very sincere. I decided to give her another chance. We spent the next two weeks together, and there didn't seem to be a problem. Then I noticed that she was still communicating with Adam frequently. I brought it up, and she said that she needed to break up with me but didn't know how. I said You get your stuff, get in your car, leave and stop talking to me. She did, and we went our separate ways. She told me that she just saw something different in her future. 

We didn't go completely no contact for a couple days. And once I decided that that was the best route, she continued to text me saying that she never felt these feelings before, and that she was sorry for hurting me. We met a couple weeks later to exchange stuff. She wanted to talk, and we talked and she apologized, and cried, and said that she wanted me back. She said that she broke character, and that she had no way of explaining or justifying her emotions, but she was willing to do anything to gain my trust back. I felt like she had an epiphany, and that she was truly remorseful. So I told her we could try again. She called Adam and broke off her relationship with him, and she called her friends saying that she made a big mistake. 

It's two weeks later now, and I'm struggling with forgiveness. She told me her and Adam had sex after we broke up. It felt like icing on the shit cake. I think about it constantly, and I'm still deeply hurt. She apologized, and I don't think she will ever do something like this again. I've always thought that I wouldn't have any tolerance for a cheater, but now I'm going against what I believed and it doesn't settle well. She sees Adam during school functions, and she keeps any communication short and impersonal which seems good to me. He has texted her several times, trying to remain friends and saying he wants to talk. She told him that anything he has to say won't change her decision. I really want her to tell him not to communicate with her at all, but I'm not the type to give orders and I don't want to cause resentment for doing that. She isn't going out of her way to contact him, but she's also not ignoring him completely like I would want. They are both in the same club, and I know that they would at least have to communicate professionally. But I honestly can't trust her around this guy, and I feel like no contact whatsoever would make gaining trust back a lot easier. Is it too late for us? Am I wrong for wanting things my way? I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, because I really do want her as a partner.

I cannot stress how manipulating this man is. Not only is he manipulative, he is immature, rude, and annoying as heck. My friend has sacrificed so much for him. School, work, and her own friends/family to please this guy.  She cooks (cuts his grapes for him because his MOM does it for him), cleans for him, drives to his house almost EVERYDAY for the last 2 years but he can't because it takes too much time for him to get the car in the parking lot underground.
There has been a couple of times that she came close to breaking up with him but he always some how makes it seem like its HER fault. She has brought up the problem about him never coming over to her house and he said that, she never asks him to come. He said that if she brings it up to him ahead of time that he would come over. He said the same thing when she asked if they can go out instead of staying at his house, while she watches him playing games for hours. My engagement party was last weekend and he refused to come (when he said he was coming) because he said there was no point In going, that he had to get up early the next day to go to school. Fine, understandable. But what does he do instead? He goes drinking with his friends  at a bar that is not even 5 mins from his girlfriends house, till 3 in the morning. What I'm pissed off about is not that he didn't come to my engagement party, it's that he is willing to cancel everything to see his friends that live in the same area as his girlfriend, but when she asks for him to come see her once a weeks at HER house...he can't. 
I can't stand him and I can't stand to see my friend crying all the time because of the stuff he says and done to her. He had never physically hit her, but I believe that he is emotionally abusing her. If she is talking, she will stop midway and start apologizing because she is talking to much. she has never been this way. Days when I had hung out with them both, she'll be talking about work and he will tell her to shut up that no one what's to hear her talk about work. Alone, she's not allowed to talk about work, friends, or anything because he finds it boring. Another thing is that he doesn't make love, he fucks. He will only make love when they get married and want a baby. So when they do fuck it hurts her....sometimes he would forcefully insert his finger up her butt when she has told him many times that she does not like anal. Last thing because I can go on about what he does, but he had also grabbed her vagina in front of me and lifted her up in front on everybody at a theme park.

NOW PLEASE TELL ME, so I can tell her that she is NOT  overreacting and that she NEEDS to leave this man because he is not healthy for her and that she is being abused! Please help me because she is very depressed and I don't know what else to do.

24431,Breakups,1ym79b,"So on Valentine's she suddenly broke up with me. I'm a affectionate person who wanted to talk with her all day. We were in an LDR. The past months she said she lost her feelings for me and that she became irritated about every little thing I do. Especially the whining and negativity. I was depressed for a month, two months and still am. I do wanna change and I realize what I did wrong. Too much drama and wanting attention/affection.

She said she still really likes me and cares about me, she just lost the romantic feelings for me. The first few days I tried to talk about it and ask for another shot, a chance to change things. She wasn't sure about it since she doesn't expect for the feelings to come back. Ultimately she didn't wanna try. Then she asked for distance and space so we could both come to terms about it. After enough time we would stay friends, something she wanted but expected me not too. 

I rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. I feel stupid for still loving her, missing her everyday. I have the hope that in a month, two months, maybe more she'll come to terms, talks to me again and tries to give it another go. We haven't talked for four days now, which are killing me. I lost my love and my best friend. I don't know what to do, should I ask her now for a chance? Or wait a few months? Or just let go? I do want to stay friends with her. 

She's my first girlfriend and we had this awesome connection. It sucks that I can't talk anymore with her at the moment. How long would she need do you guys think? The times we talked after breaking up she was sort of distant and cold.. I miss her and don't know what to do

24434,Breakups,1pwthn,"My ex girlfriend and I broke up 3 months ago, shortly before she left for college. We had our fair share of issues, as does any couple, but the primary reasons for me ending the relationship was her moving away (2 hours) for college and I wasn't completely satisfied with our sex life. 

I have really come to regret this decision. Over the past 3 months I have dated multiple women and have come to realize I made a terrible mistake. The frequency of sex was a poor reason to breakup with somebody you love if you are still relatively satisfied and I can see now that a long distance relationship with somebody I care for deeply is worth it. 

Now here is the issue...she doesn't want to get back together. We have been in close contact lately. The last 7 days we have talked everyday via text and the other day I asked her if she wanted to go out and do the cheesy things we liked to do, go see the christmas lights downtown, and watch christmas movies together. Initially she said it sounded too much like a date. I replied saying that I have no expectations and we can make it whatever we want to and she said she would think about it. She has been talking to some guy she met there since and they have been going on dates but when I asked her if it was ok that we still talked she said It's totally fine, we are nothing serious and neither of us really want a relationship.

So my question to you r/relationships is, is this worth my time? Does it sound like I have a pretty solid chance at making this work again or should I just let it go? I am more than willing to provide any other information about the relationship if it's requested. I am looking for some good advice on how to make this work and some insight into my situation. Any help would be greatly appreciated, guys.

I broke up with my girlfriend stating very plainly that although I still loved her very much, I couldn't see a future for us and I didn't want to prolong our relationship because every passing day will only make the inevitable separation that much worse.

She's a romantic, and told me during the breakup that while she wasn't going to stop me, she believed that there is only one special person for every person out there, and I was that for her. I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. 

I'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be. Hell, I'm afraid she might never actually let this go. I don't know.

I feel extremely guilty because she's begged me to come back since, and I told her a straight out no, because I didn't think the relationship would last long after this. It's only been a few days, and I'd say I've made significant progress recovering (it's been very tough though), but she hasn't turned up to school or spoken to many people. She only confided in a couple of friends and bawled her eyes out at them.

My friends told me that most breakups are one-sided anyway and it was inevitable that I'd be the asshole in the situation. But that's not really what I care about. How do I handle this? She still very much expects that somehow sometime I'll be running back to her. I've made my decision and I'm adamant that I won't, so how do I help her find closure without destroying her completely?

I wasn't sure how to approach the situation (backstory, I've never really asked a girl out before, and thus have never faced rejection, and now I am cursed with an irrationally large fear of it), until I decided on a day a couple weeks ago to ask her via social media how she had spent her day off of class. Within a few messages, she had given me her number stating that she was easier to each through there, and so the conversation continued.

We had been texting fairly often since, nearly daily, and with what seems to be welcoming conversation. There would be moments that seem obvious that one of us was flirting (for example, she asked if I had missed her when she didn't show up one day), yet I've occasionally developed the paranoia that I've been texting her too much, to the point that I would just stop texting her for a couple of days (in retrospect, I don't find this to be so terrible). I'm also afraid that I may have damaged the quality of our conversations by having asked a couple of times if something was said in bad taste due to me not getting a response so soon. I'm not used to not getting a response for hours, so I wasn't sure what to think of that. I've recently realized that she is an insanely busy person, and so I need to be more aware of that.

Her business is one of the main things that I'm trying to overcome. I'm not quite sure what it is that I want to do in terms of dating, but I want to get to know her. She works nearly everyday of the week, so I won't be able to hang out with her one night. I suppose I could ask if she'd be interested in grabbing some food, but I'd get very particular about how to properly phrase that for my intents, and that's where I get caught up on. Besides, a part of me fears that she would accept just to be nice, or reject without explicitly expressing disinterest, and that I wouldn't quite pick up on it (I feel like I'm more oblivious than most).

Communication was no problem between the two of us and we constantly hung out online through various methods to ensure that the relationship didn't get strained. She eventually started a seasonal job and her hours went from part-time to full-time very quickly. I heard less and less from her over the weekend and the following week it seemed difficult to start a conversation with her since she didn't respond at times.

So me and my boyfriend invite my fwb to his house for New Year’s Eve, because the 3 of us are just all really good friends.

This leads to my fwb asking: “can my ex. Boyfriend come? We’re friends now and i want to spend New Years with him”

This leads to me and my fwb fighting till 3am about her ex and how shitty he is.

Somehow the night ends with me and my boyfriend fighting over stupid shit that we always fight about until he decides to go to bed.

my fwb then says that she does have feelings for me and has thought about us together (as have I, but I didn't admit it). then she starts saying we cant continue with what we’re doing because of her feelings and I’m in a relationship and its not right that she has feelings for me.

Thus leads to me questioning my current relationship with the bf, being as we fight a shit ton, and I even consider breaking up with him to be with the girl.

I explain these feelings to her and we agree that even if i broke up with him, it wouldnt work because she’d feel awful for ending my relationship (thats been going for 2 years strong now) And I'd feel awful, and everyone would be a mess. 

And then we both fell asleep and agreed to talk about it later.

Basically Id just love some help because seriously, I love him, and we're best friends, but the girl is also amazing and I feel like im missing an opportunity by not being with her.

24466,Dating,2wu1qd,"I started seeing this girl, we'll call her Olivia, just over a month ago. I still am about 6 months removed from a 2 year relationship that left me mostly devastated at the end of it. Relationships are what I want, but I still think they all will end after some time.  I am afraid of committing to something because of my thoughts that I will just go through the same thing I did before. 

On to the present, the first night that we really hung out Olivia ended up sleeping at my place, with no sex because neither of us were ready. The next night we went camping and she slept with me again.  After that I have seen her about once or twice a week. Almost two weeks ago she was over, had wine, and opened up about how she was feeling about us. She said she wanted to be with me, which was nice to hear because I had similar thoughts.  So the next morning we decided to see each other exclusively. 

At 23, this is the first girl I have been seeing that I've actually wanted to get into a relationship with. She is absolutely great and I could see being with her for a long time.  But, since she is only in her first year of college still, I have doubts about that.  Also, she has tons of friends, and I really dont see her as much as I'd like.  I'm used to girls wanting to spend every waking moment they can with me and I have to work to facilitate hangouts with Olivia. She has only once invited me to something, and that was after spending most of Valentines Day with her. She seems like she is different from the girls I have seen, because she doesnt have the need to be with me, which I guess is healthy. But this makes me feel weird, maybe insecure. I want to see her basically everyday, and she seems indifferent about it, until she is actually here. Then she seems like she never wants to leave.  It is a very powerful feeling when we are together. She still hangs out with many friends more than she hangs out with me, some of them guys. 

So now I'm stuck in this spot where I can either keep being patient and see where this leads, or decide to call off our exclusivity because it hasn't been what I'm looking for, plus her age and place in life right now. I am pretty honestly tired of wanting to see her a lot and then only hanging out once or twice a week.  Everything is so different when we are together vs when we are apart. Yesterday I told her I'd like her to sleep over sometime this week to which she said she wanted to. I also told her that she is going to have to start pulling her weight in setting up hangouts. She said she would set up a night where we get dinner this week, but I dont even know if she remembers. I really dont want to be impatient, and I know when and if our relationship progresses it could be different, but I'm just kind of in a state of flux right now.

24471,Dating,2o404c,"Pretty straightforward history, at least I think so. We'd been friends and professional freelance partners (not really a white-collar setting - we're both musicians) for about six months until we broke up with our respective partners in the same week, purely coincidentally and unbeknownst to each other.

Things rapidly progressed a week later: he asked me out, we went on a date, and we hooked up, over the span of about two weeks. At his place, he initiated everything physical, so I don't believe I was the one pushing boundaries. In fact, he expressed multiple times that he didn't want to push my comfort, and that he didn't want to hurt me. We ultimately didn't have sex. However, afterward, he was still freaked out by how fast we were moving (probably because I asked him whether he was ready for this so soon after our respective break-ups) and said he needed time to process it.

So we left each other well enough alone for about four days (I did not contact him at all), during which he left town for an audition. We discussed it when he got back, and he expressed that he felt our hookup was new territory for him (neither of us had really gotten that far with someone without being in a capital-r Relationship with them), yet not a mistake. He said he still had feelings for me, that he wasn't interested in anyone else, and that he didn't want to pretend we never had a thing, yet that he wasn't ready for a relationship at this stage.

Essentially predictable material. I could handle that, even if I reciprocated his feelings. I told him that I had no expectations in either direction, that I understood that this is a stressful time of year for both of us, and that it was absolutely important that we only do what we felt was right, pressure-free. And so I assumed we could carry on being friends/professional partners.

Since then, he's been more difficult to reach (I only contact him about work-related matters these days), and isn't nearly as friendly in conversation as he used to be. We hardly greet each other in passing, sometimes completely avoiding eye contact, though we interact still on a professional basis, thankfully. He only seems to open up when we're alone, which is not very often.

We have multiple projects set up in the spring, which he reminded me of the last time we spoke. So I do hope that whatever conflicting feelings he has now are resolved by then. Truth be told, I am head over heels about this guy and would love to try dating him again, but I'm smart enough to know that I should be giving him all the space in the world (which I am doing).

Ultimately, I just want to know what could possibly be going on in his head right now, and if I should just try forgetting about him. Pretty much only an ego thing, but damn it I'm open to suggestions. :p It'd be pretty cool if this means he's still into me and is just avoiding me until he's ready to deal with his feelings.

This all happened about two months ago, by the way. Longest freaking two months of my life.

**tl;dr**: Getting mixed messages, wondering if he's into me or if I just creep him out somehow.","He [21 M] told me [20 F] that he didn't want to pretend our hookup didn't happen and that he still has feelings for me, but is avoiding me every day (2-ish weeks?)",0.0,False,0.0,0.0,1417572177.0,/r/relationships/comments/2o404c/he_21_m_told_me_20_f_that_he_didnt_want_to/,Romantic

Basically I [28M] recently (3 months ago) split with my ex girlfriend of 6 years [25F]. We had some good times together and ultimately she changed her mind about what she wanted in life and left me and the house we own together. We're still fairly civil and have no issues talking to each other really. It sucked major ass at the time but I've cried my tears and I've thankfully managed to move past it.


Recently though I met a girl [1 month ago] through a friend who I used to work with. She added me on Facebook and we started to chat. The first time we properly met was at a gig in the city although being stood about 10 feet from a huge speaker isn't the best place to get to know somebody so we agreed to meet up again for drinks. 


We met up for drinks and it went well, very well. We got on amazingly, laughed, joked, shared stories about our past relationships, hobbies, musical interests and spent the best part of 12 hours together from afternoon to evening. I made the move and kissed her later on towards the end of the night and she immediately said i'm relieved you did that because I was scared you just wanted to be friends which was nice to hear.


We met up again one night to go out drinking. She lived just round the corner and I was planning on staying in the cheap hotel for the night (so I could drink and not worry about getting a cab). Long story short she said she'd quite like to stay with me, and she did. I didn't plan for this or even expect she'd say that but she stayed in my hotel room, one thing led to another and it ended up being a great night for both of us. No regrets or anything like that, all smiles from night till morning. So, It seems to be going really well. She sent me a message the other night saying how she sleeps with my t shirt on and the fact it smells like my cologne comforts her and helps her sleep, so from what I can see is that things are really looking up and I'm really looking forward to seeing where things go with this girl; she's truly amazing.


However... The problem I have isn't with her at all... it's with me. As I mentioned before I just got out of a 6 year relationship where I lived with her for 3 years. I was used to seeing her every single day and I think the regular contact I used to have with my ex is driving me insane in my new fledgling relationship.


I'm honestly approaching obsessive levels of thinking about her. I'm constantly checking my phone to see if she's sent me a text. If she hasn't I'm worrying why. I'm always over analysing things like maybe i said something and that's why she doesn't instantly reply or maybe the sex we had before was shit and she's trying to get rid of me or maybe i'm coming on too strong or maybe I'm being too nice and deep down i know i'm bieng fucking stupid becuase her friends have all told me she doesn't reply to anyone's message not just yours. We do live about 30 minutes away from each other which she has had concerns with even though I don't at all.


Honestly I'm wondering is this fucking normal for me to be like this? Is it just the new relationship enthusiasm that I'm not used to?  I'm trying not to read like a creep when I type this and hopefully I've managed it but I honestly can't get this girl out of my head. She DOMINATES my thoughts. So basically what i'm asking is, does it sound normal to be this infatuated with somebody?

I have considered breaking up with him throughout our relationship, but I never did, because there is so much I like about him. I have always had a small feeling that I shouldn't be with him..for some reason (Does anyone else ever have that with their SO? Do you listen to it or ignore it?). But it has always been so much more good than bad in the relationship so I never have. 

I have the sinking feeling it is now time. We fight more than we are happy, the sex has stopped getting better (I sort of had high hopes but it didnt get there), and I think my low self esteem conflicts negatively with his not always thoughtfulness, and my bluntness negatively with his sensitivity. 

How do I end this with him? It will throw my life completely off kilter, hes my best friend and I rely on him emotionally a lot, but I am so afraid of how much it will hurt him. He acts tough but I know how sensitive he can be and I am so concerned. I will not be able to comfort him.

I am now heads over heels in love with her and decided to tell her about it several months ago. She responded positively at first, telling me that she had thought about being with me as well. I was incredibly excited, I thought that I was going to get what I never knew I wanted, but then she backed out. She came up with a myriad of excuses as to why she couldn't do it and after a week or so, I cut off contact with her. 

Getting over the lost of not just a romantic possibility, but also my very best friend hurt me incredibly, but I did it. I wasn't proud of myself or anything, but I did it. Part of me wishes that this was where the story ended.

Three weeks ago, I got a phone call from my ex-friend. She wanted me to come over and talk. I know now that I shouldn't have gone, but I did and she confessed to me that she made a mistake, wanted me in her life and felt like she missed an opportunity to be happy with me. In a heartbeat, four months of pain and hard work to exclude her from my life were wiped away. I was right back in that feel-good state that I get in whenever I am around her. 

Off and on for the past three weeks, she has wanted me around, talking about spending her life with me, having children, telling me how happy I make her and all of the things that I want more than anything. Then when I leave, the boyfriend that she has been unable to break up with (he won't take no for an answer) shows up and her tune changes. 

It has now gotten to the point that when I am with her, she is completely committed to me, but when I leave, she starts sending me text messages and phone calls to the effect that she is too in love with her boyfriend to even consider me.

It is driving me crazy. I don't know what I am supposed to do. It was so incredibly painful to cut her out of my life last time, and I know that she has feelings for me. I just can't keep living in limbo between together forever and never going to happen. Any advice would be more than welcome.

24485,Infidelity,3af8ds,"I [36M] never suspected anything. We have been married for seven years and have two kids, 5 &amp; 6. She [36F] has a drinking problem and on Monday night ended up blacked out on the front lawn. I found her at 10 p.m. Took me a while to find her, she had been out walking, I thought to sober up. I carried her inside and then checked her phone just trying to get a sense of what had happened over the past three hours. I saw that she was texting someone asking them to come get her, pick her up. I was stunned.

As she lay passed out on the couch I immediately started gathering all the info I could. The guy is only 18, he graduated high school a few weeks ago. My wife and I have known each other since first grade. Dated since age 26 after she had lived a wild lifestyle from age 18-22. From what I can see in texts and emails (they had to switch to email, because the kids girlfriend was getting suspicious) is that they had been seeing each other over the course of the past three weeks. How often and what transpired was unknown at this point. I assumed the worst. She usually has our kids so it wouldn’t be easy for her to meet him, but she does often send them to her moms.

I also found emails dating back to Dec. 2014 between an ex-boyfriend from 1999. I am pretty sure nothing happened between her and this guy because the logistics were much more difficult. He is married and lives farther away. He did visit her a couple of weeks ago. The kids were with her. They just talked and she said she was nervous and rambling. It’s all in the emails between them from before and after them meeting in person at our house with the kids there in the middle of the day.

Later she tries to setup for them to do yoga together where he lives. But that didn’t happen. I think the last email between them was something like, we probably shouldn’t talk, but it was nice to see you and I still think about you.
All through the night I setup for her messages on her iPhone to come to my laptop. I copy all the emails (that she thought she had deleted, but hadn’t). I copy the few remaining texts that she hasn’t deleted. And then I stir like mad all night long while she is passed out on the couch.

At 5 am, before the kids wake up I can’t take it any longer. I wake her up and confront her. I had wanted to do nothing and see what else would transpire, but I still had access to her email and texts and location without her knowing. I tell her I know everything, about not just this 18-year-old, but the two guys and that she needs to spill her guts. I’m thinking this is where she would be remorseful, but no.

She calls me everything in the book and tries to frame it so that I am the bad person for hacking into her email. (We have each others passwords. I setup her email for her. She knows this. She can look at my email too.)

I take off from work. She goes to her moms. Throughout the day she is bad mouthing me to two friends over text messages (which I can now read) and is asking them if she should contact the kid she has been seeing. But the kid’s girlfriend is on to him and is calling her constantly so she is afraid that this girlfriend will expose her publicly.

As we get closer to noon, she begins to sober up and the texts to her friends turn to more of a, “oh shit, I have screwed up bad.” kind of tone. She now wants to reconcile and is very remorseful. She is now having the reaction that I thought she would have had when I confronted her.

I start making demands. You will have to go to AA. You will have to cancel your two upcoming out of town trips, one yoga training, another a wedding. You will have to stop talking to your friend backing when you make these horrendous mistakes. I tell her it will be a long road and even then we probably won’t make it. She agrees to all of it and cancels the trips and texts the friend and says never again shall they talk.

I tell her she has to do one more thing right now. That is tell me everything and every detail. At this point I really don’t know a whole lot about what actions occurred. I say I already know most of the details, but I want to know everything, no matter how bad it is. It is like pulling teeth, but eventually throughout the course of the day I get it all out of her.

The gist of it is this:
She had sex with the 18-year-old four times during three meetings over three weeks. Those were at local parks. On the trampoline in my backyard and on my son's bed.

I was out of town camping with our son, while my daughter was with my parents at a fair during one of the meetings. The other, I was working late at a charity event and she had dumped the kids off on her mom. The other, who the fuck knows at this point. I can't it all straight.

I am broken.

I don’t want to be chump and take her back.

I don’t want to ruin our family by breaking it apart if this really is an isolated incident.

We really do love each other and have always in the past. Our sex life is great, we both agree to that. We have even been having sex regularly during the past three weeks.

Could just be the alcohol that made her do it? She says it was all a stupid mistake and that she is an alcoholic and that it led her to it.

She is saying all of the things I want to hear and doing anything I ask of her right now.

Currently she is to be the perfect housewife and cut out all extra activities that don’t involve the kids. They are not to be left at her mom's house so she can have break. She is to be acting as the perfect housewife at home. She sleeps on the couch. She has to get tested for sexual disease. She has gone to three AA meetings.

24494,Breakups,1y9ea5,"My GF and I started dating in April last year, and things went quickly. We saw each other every day and pretty quickly fell for each other. It was a solid relationship, and I was in love. 

Everything was fan-frickin-tastic. 

On the backburner of our relationship stove was her upcoming trip to Europe with her best friend and some college friends. This trip had been planned long before me, so I never offered any protest.

About 6 months into our awesome relationship, I had to drop her off at the airport, to not see her for 3 weeks. It was absolute torture. The next 3 weeks were a blur. I went through one of the hardest months of my life; she was across the world having the time of her life - and her best friend came clean about his feelings for her.

When she came back, she was different, and I knew something was up. After several weeks of being off, and a massive decline in our sexual rapport, I read through her phone and confronted her: she and her friend had been texting romantically every single day since she had gotten home. He lives in a different state, so she hasn't seen him.

I broke up with her. About 3 months ago now. Over the following months, she and I have seen each other several times, with a couple of weeks in between visits. During this, I would occasionally ask what was going on in her head, since she swore up and down that 1. she never did anything with the other guy on her trip 2. she wasn't dating him. She would just tell me she missed me alot, and was so confused. She and I only knew each other for 6 months, and she and this guy go way back.. as in 10 years.

I never pressed her further. Last night, we went to dinner, had a blast .. but she shot down my invitation to come back to my place to hang out.

I didn't protest then and there, but I called her this morning and told her I'm tired of being in limbo with her. Over the past few months, she will still make comments about us getting back together, and referring to me as her husband, and saying things like I hope you don't find someone else while I'm dealing with this..

It has been mental and emotional torture, and I told her I need to know what she's doing because it's crushing me to not know. All I can assume is that she's securing her grasp on her next branch before really letting me go.

She finally gave me an answer, and said she just wants to be alone. Her ex from 5 years ago found out that she and I broke up, and he has been calling her trying to see her. Her friend from the trip has been doing the same. And apparently so have I. And her response, which is her typical response to confrontation, has been to not deal with it and just cocoon herself.

She told me she's being pulled in so many directions by all of us, and everyone else in her life is trying to advise her one way or another, and she is tired and wants to be left alone by everybody. She's unhappy and doesn't want to feel pressured to provide happiness to anyone else.

I told her to take care of herself and deal with things. I told her I would back off and give her space. I assured her that I am not, nor will ever, ask her to be responsible for my happiness. But I also told her that she's going to have to break hearts in the end. I think she's afraid of burning bridges and losing people she loves, so she's going to put off the decision as long as possible until somebody decides for her.

I do want her back. Everytime we see each other I can see it's still there, the rapport is still the most powerful rapport I've ever experienced, and it's like a missing puzzle piece drops into place to finish the puzzle. We both feel that way.

I want to give her the space, but I am also lonely and frustrated at not having her. 

Anyone been in a similar situation? 

TL;DR: GF's best friend tells her he has feelings for her and they have a budding romance behind my back. We broke up, and over time talked things out. She's confused and feeling suffocated by all the people in her life needing something from her. She wants to be left alone and wants to deal with herself.

We used to live together for a few months but then I got a job in a different city so I needed to move. I should also mention that I'm going to move to a different country in a 3-4 months and I'll be gone for 6 months. Then I'll come back.

Before I met my boyfriend he had been talking to this girl for a while and got to know her. Then he met me and we started dating. He was still talking to this girl but it was okay since they weren't really hanging out and they were friends.

Everything was fine until I had to move to a different city. After that my bf started to hang out with this girl more and he started to have feelings for her. He got jealous of her sometimes and confessed his feelings to her. She just wanted to be friends but also said that she needs to get to know him better before anything serious happens. She had no idea that my bf was in a relationship with me and had been for 6 months. I know this because I asked my bf to give me his phone so I could check his messages (I was suspicious) and he agreed. He had deleted the conversations with this girl though and it bothered me.

When I read his messages with other people he had been telling them that our relationship isn't serious and that he's having sex with other girls. He lied about many things and when I asked about it he said that it's just how he talks with other guys. It was hurtful but somehow I didn't care because I know that I'm the only one he's been with. He likes to act tough to his friends and always talks about drugs while he's not using any. He told me that he's been cheated on in his previous relationship and he would never do that to someone.

We talked about everything and I told him to tell the girl that he's been lying and that he's in a serious relationship IF he wanted this to work. After a while he texted the girl and told her. I didn't want him to stay friends with her anymore but he said he can't cut all contact with her but they're not gonna hang out anymore. The girl was surprised when he told her and she said that he's kinda hypocritical since he had been upset before because the girl didn't tell him that she's dating other people while HE was in a relationship all along. She also said that I wouldn't even know if they hungout since I don't live in the same city and was surprised that I was upset (bf told her that I was crying) because they hadn't done anything. She and my bf go to the same university and they sometimes have lunch together. They had gone to the movies once and to the supermarket, just the two of them.

I should also mention that my bf had already sent a message to the girl before that he has feelings for her and if she doesn't have romantic feelings for him then they should be friends since he didn't want to lose her completely.

So now the girl knows about me and my boyfriend was really sorry about everything and he said that he wants to work this out. We talked and talked and cried and talked some more but I'm still not sure what to do. I believe him when he says that he hasn't done anything physical with anyone while he's been with me, but I feel like this is emotional cheating. I really love him and want to stay with him but this is so difficult, especially when we're in a LDR, we have trust issues already and it's only been 6 months.

He agreed when I told him that I want to check his phone the next time I see him and he better not delete messages. I'm gonna see him again this week.

Please tell me what to do. I feel like I'm overreacting since they haven't actually done anything and crushes happen. It was just really painful to read when he said to his friends that our relationship isn't serious and that he had feeling for this girl. He did tell the truth to the girl eventually though and apologized for everything and said that he'll never say those things about me or our relationship again.

Then I ignored the text until Thursday, and she sent me a couple of snapchats because I had gone out and was posting stuff on my story.

24499,Breakups,2dlvpx,"I (22f) and my boyfriend of two years (22m) are breaking up at the end of this month because he is moving to California. We started dating our junior year in college and just graduated this past Spring. Although we have had our share of ups and downs like any other couple, we are doing better than ever and are very happy. We really are each other’s best friends and spend most of our free time with each other. We have become that stereotypical boring couple that just wants to chill at home and watch a movie, something that we didn’t think would ever happen, but we don’t care, cause we’re happy.

He decided to move for a few reasons: he didn’t have luck finding a job in the area, he isn’t from this area and has no family here, and he misses his family a lot. He has felt for a while that there has been a lot of distance growing in his family, so he is moving to live with some family members and build a stronger relationship with his family there (family is super important to him and his family). His family also has encouraged him for a long time to move to California after college, so it was almost an inevitable decision when he could not find a job here.

We decided to not do long distance because it just seems like a bad idea for a lot of reasons. I am going to start a high pressure job in the fall, which will be taking up a lot of time and attention. Given the career choice I have taken, my life for the next few years is pretty much devoted to my career. We are both so young and our lives are so up in the air. We realize that even though we love each other right now and are really happy together, we don’t want to risk our friendship. We don’t want to be that couple fighting over the phone, wondering what the other person is doing, etc. especially while we are in such a huge transition period of our lives and we are so young, you get the point..

I am just really dreading him moving. I start to cry every time I think about it and it is really hard for me to imagine meeting anyone else that I will love so much. The logical side of me knows that I will be okay in the long run, but I know I’m going to be a wreck when it happens. I keep going over the situation in my head and wonder how I’m going to deal with this. I’m not only losing a boyfriend, I’m losing my best friend. It’s just hard because I don’t know how I’m going to NOT talk to him when he leaves, but at the same time, I know I should just move on because talking to him will only make getting over him worse… And it crushes me to think that if we do still talk when he’s gone, I won’t be able to tell him I love him or hear him tell me that without making moving on impossibly more difficult for both of us.

Does anyone have any advice for situations like this? How can I move on? What’s the most painless way to go through a breakup like this? Or any stories on failed long distance relationships and why? I think hearing these will help me believe that long distance won't work as I keep find myself hoping that we will somehow work out.

24503,Breakups,2g2ol6,"Hello, Reddit. In advance, I just want to say thank you for taking a look. This is the biggest crisis in my life right now, and any advice is appreciated. :) And now, on to the backstory...

From early 2013-2014, I was dating a seemingly perfect woman. She's beautiful, intelligent, sweet, actually understands my bizarre sense of humor, and above all, was my best friend. She and I had been friends for years and rarely ran into any sort of conflicts. She was my first love, and honestly, I wanted her to be my last. We met back in High School, but she ended up moving a few states away once she started College. I, however, remained in state for higher education. 

As a result, for about 8 months out of the year, our relationship was long-distance. We talked and Skyped every single night and I sent her gifts almost every week. I was in heaven. Finally, I had found someone as crazy about me as I was about them. She was truly there for me, even though her physical presence was not. I didn't mind, though. She had her occasional outbursts, though, as she suffers from depression. But I felt like there wasn't anything we couldn't endure as a couple. I was completely, hopelessly in love with her. I tell you all of this so you'll realize just how badly she hurt me when she broke things off.

It's March 2014. On the night of her 21st birthday, my ex went out for some drinks with her friends, naturally. We shared a brief phone call before she left, knowing she would be heavily intoxicated for the remainder of the evening. Little did I know that would be our final romantic conversation. The next day, and indeed the entirety of the following weekend, she was off. Distant, quiet, and extremely sad. Whenever I asked her what was troubling her, she pushed me away. Finally, on Sunday night, she broke up with me. And she didn't even give me a reason! I was devestated. I spent the remainder of the week (my Spring Break) drunk or crying (often both). I was absolutely devestated. My entire world had been rocked. I didn't know what to do. As you might expect, I made some very poor decisions in those first few weeks. I went through the typical stages. Denial, depression, anger, and eventually, acceptance. It took me a LONG time, but I finally got to the point where I felt I was over her. I even started casually seeing another girl in late July.

Fast forward to September 2014. I receive a letter written by none other than my ex. Note that I haven't seen her nor had extended contact with her since the breakup. In the letter, she confesses that she hasn't stopped thinking of me and regrets hurting me so badly. She goes on to list in heart-wrenching detail how things remind her of me. But, more importantly, she explains why she broke things off in the first place. It turns out, on her birthday, she cheated on me with her best male friend. They were both drunk, and simply acted on a What if? whim. I was shocked. I felt like I was experiencing my breakup all over again. I was left with that all-consuming question. How could she do this to me? But the more I reflected on things, the more I realized that I should be asking another question. Why didn't she tell me?. She made a drunken mistake. There would have been a greater chance of reconciliation had she just been honest! But she was a coward, and waited until over six months after the fact to tell me. I'm feeling a spectrum of emotions.

So, what should I do? Just ignore the letter? Chew her out for letting me believe there was something wrong with me as a boyfriend? I definitely still have lingering feelings for this woman, and yet I hate myself for doing so. I'm having thoughts of maybe trying to work things out. I just don't know what to do anymore. Again, thanks for any advice, Reddit. It's much appreciated.

24504,Breakups,1l0sru,"Hi reddit. Usually I don't post on reddit, but recently I don't really know how to deal with my current situation (this is a throwaway btw). Any advice is appreciated.

So it began last summer when I met this girl (let's call her Jenny) at my company. She was here for an internship. During that time, we hung out during work and our relationship began to slowly evolve into something more than friendship. However, I had a serious relationship with my girlfriend at the time (3 years), so I began to shy away from this girl because I didn't want to cheat on my girlfriend (Amanda). So after that summer, Jenny left and I did not have any contact with her besides some texts from her here and there. 

Fast forward to this year, my girlfriend has to take a trip to another city due to her company training. Unfortunately, the day that she left was when Jenny came back as a full time employee. I tried to say hi to Jenny the first day at work, but she was really cold to me and didn’t say much. However, after a couple days, we hung out. While we were hanging out, it was just like the year before. However, after we hung out, she would go back to the cold demeanor of ignoring me. This really began to mess with my head.

At this moment, I felt that I began to like Jenny which I know is terrible since I had a girlfriend. But I don’t know why, but I started to become more and more attracted to her. As time went on, I began to try to hang out with her more and more to the point where it became obsessive and unhealthy. It was completely different from the year before when she would be the one suggesting we hang out. I could tell that I was becoming more and more pushy in our friendship. I unfortunately wanted more.

It culminated to one day, where Jenny promised to meet up but didn’t show up. I was incredibly angry and distraught since I became really attached to her. That night, I forced her to come over by saying I had something really important to talk about, and I confronted her as to why she was acting the way she was. When she came she was noticeably upset.

That night, I found out that she broke up with her 4 year long boyfriend last year during her internship because she liked me last year and knew she didn’t have feelings for him anymore. However, since I had a girlfriend last year, she “knew I would never be with her” and she suppressed the feelings throughout the year. Now she said she didn’t like me as much as she did last year, but still had some feelings for me. 

I (being the idiot that I am) asked Jenny if I asked her out if she would say yes. She said she would. 

I had a trip to see my girlfriend that week. 

During the trip, my girlfriend could see that I was preoccupied with other thoughts on my mind and asked what was wrong. I told her the truth and said that I am starting to like this other girl (I know… I’m horrible…). By the end of the trip, I broke up with my girlfriend and came back feeling like I am the world’s biggest asshole and a little depressed.

When I came back and told Jenny, she was not happy. She avoided me even more and told me I shouldn’t have broken up with my girlfriend and she could see that my girlfriend really loved me. However, after a couple days, I was able to convince her to hang out with me again (again being really pushy about it), and we went on a date. During the date I asked her out and she (reluctantly I think) said yes. 

The next week was a nightmare. We would be considered dating for a day, then she would call me the next saying she’s not sure. However, when we would meet up, she would change her mind and say that she was sure again. This continued for quite a while and really messed with my mind even more. It just made me more desperate to hang out because she was “sure she wanted to be with me” when we were together and had doubts when we weren’t. Every day was like a rollercoaster ride

After a week of this occurring, we finally had a talk and could both say that we were not happy. She said she didn’t want a relationship right now and that she couldn’t put her heart into it if she still wasn’t sure if we were meant to be together.  She told me that she liked me but didn’t really like me. The feeling from last year was gone she said, and she doesn’t know if it will come back. I still wanted to be in the relationship, but I recognized how much pain is was causing both of us. We ended up deciding to go no contact each other for a few weeks. 

Looking back on it I think I’m being an idiot for a variety of reasons. First, I think that I shouldn’t have been so pushy with Jenny since she clearly was not ready for anything really serious. I was treating our relationship as if it were with Amanda  - and if you treat someone you meet similarly to someone you’ve been with for 3 years, they’re going to be scared away. Also, I think it was really stupid of me to ask her out right after I broke up with Amanda. I clearly wasn’t ready for a new relationship and needed time to piece myself together. I also shouldn’t have been attracted to Amanda in the first place. I should have never given myself the opportunity to start liking her. Once I knew she liked me, I should have avoided her to be fair to Amanda.

I feel really frustrated recently. I really wish that I loved my girlfriend because she is such a great person. I really believe that if we did have a future together, it would be amazing. At the same time, I can't seem to let go of Jenny. She’s constantly on my mind, and I’m just thinking of ways to get her back (although we’re still not talking). It's almost as if I can see the same situation from both sides (the one who wants to like the other person back and the one who wants the other person to like him back); however, the sad thing is I can’t seem to figure out how to solve the problem from either side. I've been tormented by this for a month and would love to just make a decision, but I find that even I don’t know what I really want. 

I don’t want to contact my old girlfriend unless I was sure that I wanted to be with her and I could provide her the love she deserves. I am still very much attracted to Jenny (which makes me not want to contact my girlfriend because that would be unfair to her), but I don’t know if I fucked up so much that it would be impossible for it to work. I think I really want to be with Jenny, but I don’t know if I messed up so much that I no longer have a shot. Does reddit have any thoughts?

24508,Dating,2oez81,"I texted this girl over facebook (we went to school together  over 10 years ago and havent seen us since then) and we went to grab a drink. We had a great time so I invited her over to dinner on another night. She came over at my place, we had dinner and had a great time. Then we had sex. And again. And again. Best sex of my life. We met again some days later and did the same thing - sex, sex, sex. So we talked about it: I (just coming out of a 4.5year old relationship) told her that I don't want a relationship, just sex. She agreed and added lately I had some bad experiences with relationships and got dissapointed a lot. No problem for me, I just want to have sex and hang out from time to time because I enjoy spending time with her. And the sex is mindblowing. So we agreed on being FWB (her words, not mine!) I asked her if she was seeing other men and she replied no, not anymore. You satisfy me. I'm not planning on banging other men. Now I have to tell you, this woman is an aboslute nympho. Never met a woman like her in my entire life. But we fucking clicked in bed. I satisfied and dominated her so hard. She loved it and told me that no other men has ever did to her what I did. Now she could be lying of course but that's very unlikely as she is a very honest and direct person.


We met again for lunch some days later, then went to my place and had sex again. This all happened in a time span of probably 8 days. She texted me a lot in this time but I always killed the conversation because a) I don't like texting too much and b) I didn't want to get too emotionally involved with her. 


I then had to do my military service so I was only at home once a week (that's how military service works over here in europe). I got a bit needy and said I'm home on X. Are you free then?. I didn't text other women because I knew she would be guaranteed, awesome sex. Quality over Quantity. That's when things started to get strange. Normally she would reply instantly. But that stopped. Then she said she's sick so she can't meet me. No biggie. But I still had a strange feeling. She talked about an internship she absolutely wanted so she had to put in some time to write her application, update her CV and stuff. I then went back to military service. Fast forward a few days I write her again when I'm available. No response for 16hours. I knew something was strange. Then I get her text:
I'm very sorry but I don't want to continue the thing we have started. I can't explain it to you, it's just what I'm feeling right now and I want to focus on the internship and my other examinations (she talked about  a lot of universities she wants to attend) and if all goes well I'll have this internship in Y (another city) for 6 months starting in january. It's all too much for me now. I hope you understand. I'm sorry that it turned out that way but I'd rather be open and honest about it than lie to you.


I replied something along the lines  I had a feeling that something wasn't 100% ok. I can understand you but at the same time feel that it's very unfortunate because we had something great going - having great sex and getting along very well. I then wished her good luck with whatever she was planning and added that it sucks that we say goodbye over text.


To which she replied: I'm very sorry that it's over text but I just wanted to tell you my feeling instead of lying and being akward. We can see eachother again. It's not goodbye. I just wanted to tell you what I think and what I feel. 

Me: Sure no problem. Just write me when you have time and we're going to have a drink

Her: Okay

Now I have absolutely no Idea how this happened out of the blue. We had a great time - in and outside of the bed - and we clicked very well. Maybe we clicked too well? I think something about her story is strange: While I do get that she want's to focus on her career I don't get why she doesn't want to have sex anymore. Sex is the best thing to relieve stress. Nothing is better than sex after/before/while studying (probably not WHILE studying but you get my point...). For me it's either a) she think's I want more than sex or b) she want's more than sex and is trying to protect herself from falling for me because she cleary put her carreer over everything else. I also dont get her feelings. It's just what I feel right now WHAT do you feel? do you have feelings? do you not have feelings?

**Important:** I am absolutely new to this FWB thing and I'd like to have some insights from you guys! I talked with three friends about this (2 male, 1 female) and they all said it's very strange. especially the feelings-part. Maybe I got this all wrong and it's just too much for her indeed. I have no idea. 

I'm planing on not texting her for at least two weeks and just wait for her to reply. Because I have a feeling she will write back. As arrogant as this sounds but I know she wants the D.

Even after all the wonderful advice I got on the last post I decided to try and work things out with my ex girlfriend. If you have read the previous post you would know that this most likely was a poor decision. But I did it any way. 

Our brilliant scheme to try and fix things went something like this: we would stay single but try and be really close friends while slowly and steadily working on the things that we had issues with in the relationship. We would try and communicate our feelings and make sure that everything we had an issue with came to surface so that we could work it out and eliminate the problem. This has been going on for about the amount of time between now and when I posted last. This seemed like a good idea at the time but there was one thing that maybe made it all doomed to failure. We kept having sex. With sex we lost almost all independence we had build up in the few weeks we spent not talking. It just made the feelings we had for each other even stronger and in my humble opinion made even more problems arise and more fights happen. But that's not really the main issue. 

The main issue is that nothing has really changed. I think we have been doing this for almost a month and a half ( i haven't really been keeping tract of it but it seems like a life time). At first everything was running smoothly. Almost like we hit another honeymoon phase in the relationship. We didn't really see each other very often but when we did it was fun and exciting and when she left I would find my self wishing she hadn't. After a while things slowly started to go exactly back to where they had left off in the relationship. She started wanting to see me more and more and for a while there was a point where I couldn't even tell the difference between us being friends and us being in a relationship. She kept demanding more and more. Everything I did started to be less and less of what she wanted. She would get upset if I didn't give her enough attention and I was treating her differently than I used to. Then after a fight would occur she would sober up and realize that yeah we do need to back off a little and stop trying to move so fast. This would go on and still goes on and on in some sort of cycle that has no symmetry and makes me a very confused man.

My point of view on the whole thing was that this was a trial period. There was no set outcome and in no means was this an excuse to be together with out being together. (in the beginning she came up with this rule that we couldn't see other people during this trial period because that would defeat the purpose) I was trying to make sure there was this very visible boundary between what was going on now and what had gone on when we were dating. Yes, we were hooking up from time to time but I wanted to make sure that outside of the bed room we were acting as friends should and making sure that we were taking care of business when any issues came up. I really wanted to see this work. But pay special attention to the word wanted. 

I have no idea what I want any more. Every week seems to have its own fight and now its almost to the point that I am expecting it to come. Almost everything I do doesn't seem to be good enough for her anymore. She has become so clingy and so controlling and manipulative that its almost like shes trying to make her manipulation games as visible as she can. She will say things just to see how I react to them. When we are fighting she says things then doubles back on her self 20 minutes later and says the opposite while denying she had the previous standpoint in the first place. We go in circles and circles for what seems like hours and nothing gets accomplished. Half the time I feel like I'm in a contest to see who can point the finger more than the other. 


Don't be fooled though because I know I am not perfect. I know I don't always treat her the way I should. I know that sometimes I try and say things to get her feelings going just like she does because hey, misery loves company right? But the fact of the matter is that I am trying so hard to save this relationship and I feel like I'm only getting resistance from her end. She agrees that we need to work on being independent and we need to fix our issues between us before we get back in a relationship. But she has the hardest time carrying out those agreements. So I try and communicate to her that these decisions are only going to hurt us more than help us but every time she gets all upset and pissy. Its almost as if shes saying she agrees with me and then goes and does the opposite because she thinks she can get away with it. Basically manipulating me into being in a relationship. Its almost as if she has no regard for my feelings and what I want. She has roommates in her apartment that don't like me at all. They literally go out of their way to cause arguments with me just to spite me. So what does my ex girlfriend do? She basically forces me to go over to her place to hang out even after I told her that I didn't want to be around her roommates. (we went to Walmart together in her car and she just drove me to her place against my will) The list goes on and on but that is basically the gist of how things go. 

Then there's her family who has an even worse opinion of me than they did before. They constantly tell her that she can do better than me. (I know this because she goes out of her way to tell me this) They think I never treated her right. They think that I don't like them because about half the times my ex girlfriend invited me to her family functions I had to pass because school would be kicking my ass so id have to study. When ever I did go over there they would just kinda treat me like a piece of meat and ignore me. They wont even give me chance. Not even since day one of the relationship. They told her they didn't like me before they met me. Thats a huge deal to me. 

So I guess the point I'm trying to get to here is that I need some advise to move forward here. I don't want to live like this anymore. People are saying to get out while you can and move on. But the fact of the matter is that I do have strong feelings for this girl regardless of the circumstances. Thats the whole reason that I'm in this situation right now. I want to save this thing but when do you reach the point of hey we gave it our best shot things just aren't working out. I guess I'm coming here for some in put on the situation and maybe some guidance. I'm lost and confused and I'm a terrible writer so please feel free to ask questions. I'm going to sleep but i will be on tomorrow to try and interact with anyone who wants to help. Thanks. 
---   
TL:DR Me and my ex gf have been going through some sort of trial period. We both know we have to work on our issues but her actions speak louder than her words do. Shes trying to act like we are together when we aren't. Nothing about our issues seem to be getting fixed. We are fighting all the time. Her family doesn't like me and wont give me a chance. I still have strong feelings for her but things just aren't working out well. Please help me figure out the best course of action. I'm looking for guidance and advice. Thanks.

24513,Dating,1prqt4,"Alright, so this is basically the situation at hand so far:

My roommates and I decided to have a post-Halloween party yesterday and invited a lot of friends, who in turn invited a lot of their friends. Things were starting to pick up, and as one of the (sober) hosts I had taken it upon myself to sort of drift around, talking to people and making sure everyone was generally good to go with their drinks, food, candy, what have you. 

I bumped into one girl in particular who kind of helped me throughout the night, pointing out party fouls and helping me clean up. We started talking and eventually we made it to the couch where we talked it up for awhile. Eventually I pointed out the fact that we had a treehouse in the back of the house we were renting and made some cheesy joke about Arizona stars and that's when things got interesting.

We had some fun, and things started getting hot and heavy, but she eventually told me that she had just gotten out of a relationship about two weeks ago that she had changed colleges for, and was trying to distract herself from thinking about him or the relationship at all, and that she had made out with a couple other people at the party, but hadn't gone as far with them as she had with me. She also mentioned that she hadn't been physically touched by him in at least the last four weeks of their relationship.

She started to cry a little bit and I just held her for a little while. We cuddled for a little while, laughed about the guy that came over to piss behind the treehouse, and eventually she realized that her ride was looking for her, and took off, but not without giving me her number first. What I need to know is this: I know that she said that she was trying to distract herself, but I feel like we really, really clicked last night. When we (had the ability) to talk, we talked a lot, and there was a lot of laughing and romantic smiling. However, if she's still dealing with her emotions with her past relationship, how long should I wait before trying to get ahold of her? Should I even try at all, considering she said she was just trying to distract herself?

24515,Breakups,1kva5a,"As I've already said, it was a huge mistake on my part, so I'll explain what was going through my mind when I did it. 

We were schoolfriends and when we got together it was about half a year before we went to university. We decided to make it work despite being 150 miles apart. It did work, really, really well. We spent weekends with one another and it made us really strong, we trusted one another like I didn't think was possible. The problems came after we both both graduated. She wanted to stay in London but I moved home roughly 300 miles away now because I had a stable full time job I could walk back in to. The annoying thing for me was she didn't pursue her career in London, she went into a retail job and hasn't done anything to forward her career at all.

I was promoted at my job (ok it was only at a bar, but assistant manager at 21 isn't bad) and so when she asked me (only once) to move down I said I needed to sort out my money situation before we moved in together. This was roughly a year ago. At the time I thought nothing of it but since then I now know it really hurt her and she blames me.

In the lead up to last Christmas with one thing and another I was doing 50-60 hour weeks at the pub and one of my colleagues who is 10 years older than me took me under his wing and we spent a lot of time together (he was away from his wife too). I could tell she resented me spending time with him because we worked long hours, with maybe one day off a week each, we would get drunk and watch shit TV with all the boys round.

This is where it started really, I kept telling her and telling her I was working really hard to save up money so we could do something in the future but all she saw was me never having time to phone her or do the things we used to do in uni (like watching the same film over the phone at the same time, or just talking all night). She started getting very angry and started blaming my colleague for taking me away from her etc. I never talk to anyone about relationships but I brought it up with him, a guy who has a lot of experience and has been happily married for 7 years. He asked me does she make me happy. I took this question the wrong way in retrospect because I said no, she isn't making me happy. Really I think he meant, does she make you happy overall? To which I would have said yes. One thing led to another and I basically convinced myself I needed time alone for a bit and it would be unfair to go on a break, so I went down to London and broke up with her. Telling her I still love her but our paths aren't the same anymore. 

She was devastated. Since then she told me it absolutely destroyed her. And we didn't speak for a while. The first few weeks for me were great, I felt free and I'm not ashamed to admit I slept with a lot of girls that came to the bar that knew I had recently turned single. That was when I started to miss her, miss what we had together and just the comfort of a relationship. I got in touch with her and offered to visit. 

I went down to London and wrote a big letter, telling her not only how sorry I was but how wrong I was and that the whole break up was due to me being selfish and nothing to do with anything she did. I asked for her back, took her to our favourite restaurant and that night I had planned to stay at a mate's in London but she said I could crash at hers. We got back and she said don't sleep on the couch. So we got into bed and she started cuddling me, I tried to stop it but there was electricity in the air everywhere and we ended up having the most mind blowing sex ever. Cue next morning, we're walking to the station and she kisses me and says this is April 16th, the date of our original anniversary, when we get back together we can have the same anniversary. My mind was blown, I thought, wow this is perfect, fate. I went home with a spring in my step thinkingeverything would be great. 

Nope. After speaking everyday one Sunday two weeks later she phones me and says I'm going on holiday with the girls so I said OK great, when was this booked? She said today. Before I even took a breath she said and to be honest, the fact I haven't made my mind up about you says a lot, we can't get back together, we tried but it didn't work. I was literally sick there and then. I said how on earth was this trying? We didn't see eachother. When we are together we are in love, apart, she buries her head in the sand because it's easy to ignore her feelings for me.

I was a mess basically. And not only that but two days later I was made redundant. As someone who is a heavy drinker anyway, let me tell you, the two weeks after that were not pretty. I carried on and luckily my savings made life easier. 

I get this phonecall anyway, my old colleague had moved back down south and now had a job at his new pub he was running, he needed a new AM, salary, the lot. Less than an hour from London. I went to see the place to make up my mind and loved it, I set my heart on moving away from everything and making a go of it in a new place. Next thing I know I step off the tube in London to a text from my ex. Just got back from holiday, had a shit time, really missing you. So I said, I'm in London let's have coffee. We do and I said to her my family are going on holiday in a few weeks (which was supposed to be with her anyway, I'd already bought her plane ticket) she could still come it'd be perfect to sort everything out. She said no, it would be awkward blah blah (even though my parents wouldn't care if we were together or not). So I leave thinking it's all over and start seeing this younger girl (18) to get my mind off her. We are out one night and one of my ex's best mates sees us and immediately phones her up. That night we have a blazing row on the phone. Horrible things were said by both of us. She calls me allsorts and thinks I'm with this girl to wind her up and she's a child and all this bullshit. I say, I've put my heart on a stick for you and you're too stubborn to forgive me when I've done nothing but show you respect and love.

We don't speak for weeks and I go on holiday. She randomly texts me, have a nice holiday. We start talking everyday while I'm away, everything seems to have calmed down and she asks me to take pictures of 'our' room. I do and she says I'm gonna regret saying this but I wish I had come now. 

I didn't say told you so, I just carried on. I was too angry because I knew it would have been perfect.  So I come back and at this point I'm moving all the way to a new city to start my new job. One of my first days off I'm going to london to get some clothes and I text her saying lets meet up, I had a small present off holiday, bought her some of her favourite flowers and we go for dinner. We are arguing but now in a bad way, more of a banter way. And I bring up how the holiday would have been perfect. She goes on this massive rant about how she doesn't want to be in a relationship and makes me feel 2 inches tall whhen I haven't even said to her that's what I want, I didn't even bring it up. She makes me feel like shit so I pay for dinner, threw her presents on the table and walked out. She follows me and I stop at a bar because my train wasnt for ages and she catches up, I was in a bad mood but she offers me a drink so I take it. Then she starts trying to make conversation and I'm just not in the mood anymore, I want to go home, I felt humiliated. We walk to the train station I say bye and don't give her a hug or kiss. As I'm walking off she screams after me that I'm acting like a child I walk back and say look, I love you, you love me. Make your mind up and stop torturing me for making a mistake. I walk off and she's shouting at me again and I carry on down the escalator and don't look back.

That's the last time I've spoken to her, it was her birthday last week and I didn't speak to her at all. She hasn't said anything to me about it. I can't stop dreaming about her and it's killing me, I love my new job and my new place but I miss her more than I even did when we were together and I think she's over it. 

I know this is a long one, but I need help. Move on or talk to her? What could I say that hasn't already been said? No one comes close to her and she says I only want her back because she doesn't want me. Is that true? I've been in love with her for over 4 years and that hasn't changed. I've said everything I can already and hate myself for making so many mistakes but maybe I've just been trying too hard to win her back.

**tl;dr**: I fucked up, apologised. She's tortured me over it. Things got messy, then ok, now they are messy again. I want to work things out but she's not even willing to try or admit she's been incredibly selfish.","I [22M] broke up with my girlfriend[22F] of 3 and a half years 6 months ago.

24516,Dating,1pngzn,"So without going into too much detail or anything, I met a girl over the summer in a group for students dealing with social anxiety. She was the original initiator; invited me over to chill after our last group meeting. We've only gotten together a couple of times since the end of group and things went pretty well, but there has been large gaps in between where we haven't had any contact. 


What I mean is, after the first time we hung out together I didn't hear from her for about a month before she invited me over again. That meeting went well and I thought we were hitting it off pretty good so I invited her over once afterwards, but she said she couldn't make it. I texted her again a few days later and never heard back from her. Since I didn't hear from her, I assumed she must not really be interested in seeing me again so I backed off.


Fast-forward about another month or so, I work up the courage to reach out to her again and suggest we should catch up sometime. I was actually a bit taken back when she actually responded positively to the idea, as I had only decided to contact her again just to sort of prove to myself that I wasn't too afraid to do it/wouldn't have to regret knowing that I didn't even try.


What is still throwing me off though, is that even though she did text me back and agreed we should catch up sometime, when I responded to her text I got nothing back again! I feel like I'm getting mixed signals, and don't know what the right course of action is here.


Just for reference the texts I sent/received went as follows:

Me: Hey. How are you? It's been a while, we should catch up sometime.

Her(~day later):I'm great thx :) how bout you? And yes, we should.

Me(10 min later): I'm pretty good, just busy with school mostly. if youre not busy [or] anything we should get [together] after class or this weekend or something.


And that's where I didn't hear anything back from her. I did leave out a couple words probably just because I was kind of nervous but I don't think what I sent was too ambiguous or anything that she was too confused by it to respond.


What should I do at this point? Just waiting around to hear back from her hasn't really been working out for me so far so I feel like I should continue to try to initiate contact, but I don't want to scare her away or anything.

24518,Breakups,2eqkyc,"   She was the only girlfriend I’ve ever had, and we had a bit of a history. We were in eighth grade together, and we happened to participate in an extracurricular activity that involved a lot of speaking and interaction. I developed a really hardcore crush, and I was pretty heartbroken when she went to a different high school than me.

   This January, with both of us as high school seniors, we started talking on Facebook, and I made a fairly good impression on her. This was really the only contact we had had since eighth grade. I went over to her house for a game night with some of her friends, and we went on a date the next week. I was absolutely thrilled- eighth grade me would be literally weeping with joy at this. We started dating, and we became best friends- I told her things I’d never told anybody else, and she did the same. She said I was her best friend before I realized I felt the same way about her, but it was absolutely true- I hung out with her more than and trusted her more than really anybody else. We totally accepted and empathized with each other. We sort of bonded over the movie Frozen, and we both saw it multiple times together and apart. We both know the movie by heart. I’ve seen it 8 times, I think, to date. I love the movie, she loves it. When prom came around, we were watching it and singing and dancing to “Love Is An Open Door” together, and I got down on one knee and said “Will you go to prom with me?” She squealed and was thrilled and brought her mom in the room so we could reenact the whole scene again. Speaking of prom, it was actually at the site of our first date.

   She got me into the TV shows Teen Wolf and Glee, and I love both of them. Both have this reputation, this image as being cliche and stereotypical and lame, but I really do love both of them. She also totally introduced me to theatre and musicals- I’d been vaguely familiar with them, but I didn’t realize how awesome they could be. Years before I’d known The Nightmare Before Christmas by heart and I loved to sing along to it, but I didn’t realize that meant I might love musicals. Since, I’ve fallen in love with American Idiot, Bare, Spring Awakening... We wrote a parody of Let It Go together. I learned a complex version of Let It Go on piano to play for her. I even wrote some pretty good poetry for her. I wrote a short, sad piece back in eighth grade about unrequited love, and I showed it to her, and she loved it. So I wrote a really happy, romantic piece, and I think she loved that too. Since then I’ve written a few mopey, depressive, angsty ditties about how I feel right now. Of course, I haven’t shown those to her, or anybody.

   She broke up with me just over a month ago. We hadn’t really been able to see each other much because she was so busy- she was part of a local theater’s production of Aladdin, she took on a job at Chili’s, she had dance lessons, and she wanted to hang out with her other friends as well. I had literally nothing on my plate- I stayed reasonably productive, studying Spanish and science and other things- but only then did I realize that I have no life. I have a longtime best friend (currently 100 miles away at a different university, though we text and game together a little), I had a more recently acquired best friend, and that was it. I was only acquaintances with the people at school. She said she wasn’t really ready for a relationship at this point in her life, and that she does want to stay friends, but we should give it a little while. She’s at a community college only half an hour away. This provides some context to her grousing a month-ish ago about me not having a car on campus- parking here is horrible and she doesn’t want to have to drive down here every weekend.

   I think of her all the time. When we were dating, she crossed my mind almost every time I woke up, and that has become a habit that I cannot break. I watch Teen Wolf and Glee and she’s on the back of my mind- though the shows do provide some excellent temporary escapism, once it’s over I think of her and wonder about her thoughts on the show. I tried watching a single one of Frozen’s songs on Youtube, and I broke down. No way could I watch the entire thing. I took on a theatre class because I thought it would be fun, and it is. But again, I have trouble not thinking of her occasionally during class whenever the teacher says something I recall her saying about theatre. Half the music on my iPod is musicals she introduced me to. We watched a gazillion Disney movies together- we watched Hercules after prom at her house when we feel asleep together, and heck, we both lost our virginity to Lilo &amp; Stitch! It was highly consensual and intimate and protected and wonderful, thank you very much. I would never have approached the subject of sex- she said she wanted to, and like a month or so later, we did it. Neither of us regret it at all.

   I write this sitting in the college library after staring at work for two hours and being unable to complete it. I’m great at academics, it’s not a problem of failing the classes- I just can’t do anything right now. It feels like she took the thing in her life she cared about least and discarded it. I’m questioning nearly everything in the relationship, all the memories, the things said and unsaid. I’m trying to distract myself, but it’s really, really tough. We haven’t communicated in about three weeks, and I don’t know if it’s time to text her just like I would as a friend, asking if she’s seen this cool movie I’ve been raving about, or if I should mention the whole relationship/breakup thing to see if I need more closure, or if I should just keep waiting. The problem is, the waiting hurts, maybe as much as the feelings of rejection. What do I do? How do I distract myself? How do I make the pain go away?


P.S. If anybody tells me I need to just ‘let it go’, I will cry. And then hunt you down.

24519,Dating,2uv9x8,"I'm a post-graduate student in the UK currently studying a masters in Criminology. During my undergrad studies at the same university I met my friend (for the purposes of this, Lily) though one of the societies we were both part of. There was no burst of light or a fanfare or such when we met, we just go on and enjoyed each others company whether it be as part of a group or just the two of us meeting for coffee. I saw Lily as attractive but wasn't *attracted* to her, her being in a long term relationship at the time and my romantic interests being else where.


As time went on we learnt more about each other and grew closer, especially during her final year when her physical health nose-dived and I kept her company while she was on bed-rest once she came out of the hospital, watching films and studying with her. 

She graduated and moved in with her long term boyfriend, who I got on with really well. While I was finishing my final year of my undergrad, Lily and I kept in contact and met up a few times in a city between where both of us lived. Being apart really didn't have a detrimental effect on our friendship, if anything we became closer sharing more and more about our pasts, which for Lily held some heavy topics; including being sexual abused by her father and raped and impregnated by her brother in law. However, to look at her and to know her now you wouldn't really know unless you looked really closely and were around Lily a lot (which due to our geographic distance, I wasn't).


So skip ahead to November 2014, and several things come to a head, though looking back it all happened so fast I couldn't tell you the order (so the order given here is just for narrative purposes). Firstly, Lily and her boyfriend of 6 years broke up as he had realised that he wasn't ready for marriage and children, both of which are high priorities for Lily. The second thing was that after a good 18 months of being in good health, Lily was once again in and out of hospital due to problems with her blood. She subsequently went on radiotherapy which thankfully seems to have treated the symptoms but unfortunately hasn't been able to cure the underlying issue. 

Thirdly, and the point of all this really, is that Lily was diagnosed with Dissociative identity disorder (DID) which basically means that her within her subconscious reside several different distinct alters (personalities) as well as her own host subconscious. In laymans terms these were created by Lily's mind to as a coping mechanism to protect her from the various trauma's she went through when she was younger. 

As far as we're aware at the moment there are 4 different alters hosted by Lily who are as follows (just like Lily, these names are different from the real names of the alters):

* Natalie - Who's goal is to protect those who Lily care's about
* Adam - Who's goal is to protect Lily from outside threats
* Beth - Who's basically a personified version of depression
* Sarah - Who we don't know much about but seems to want peace and quiet (she only really manifests while Lily is sleeping and will cause her to sleep-walk to somewhere like a park).

Since this diagnosis, Lily has been going to therapy every other day to try and make contact with each of the alters and with the ultimate goal of bringing them all into a healthy whole, which so far seems slow work but they are making progress. 

Also since this happened, Lily and I have been talking everyday, talking about everything we always did but also now talking about more intimate subjects, such as what we'd want from an ideal relationship, preferences in sex and of course the DID and Lily's past. Nothing has been off the table, if a question is asked then we answer it honestly. 

Skip ahead to last weekend, we had organised for Lily to come up to visit me at university, mainly because we hadn't seen each other since before all of this happened and because we thought that she deserved a break from everything that was happening in a familiar environment. 

She arrived Thursday evening and we stayed up pretty late talking, enjoying the novelty of doing it in person for once. I only have a single bed so that first night I slept on the floor while she slept on my bed. The next day, it had snowed so we went for a walk out in the woods near my accommodation. When we got back we cuddled together on my bed to warm up and talked. During a break in conversation I kissed her on the top of her head, something I've done hundreds of times before, but this time she looked at me and we kissed. Slowly over the course of the afternoon this developed into more and more and the rest of the weekend was spent together in my bed, enjoying each others company like new lovers do. 

It gets to Sunday and Lily is going to be leaving that afternoon but that morning we continue to be intimate and also talk about what we're going to do going forward. We both agree that we should have some time to think to ourselves before doing anything that would be fuelled by the passion of the weekend. 

That evening, I message Lily to check that she's got back home safely, which she did, and we begin to talk again about what we might do, which is when things get weird. One message from Lily is like normal, written in first person and in her usual style of writing. But the next switches to refering to Lily in third person saying You should know I'm part to blame for Lily's reluctance to peruse this further, most of her self control is actually me overpowering her but in a way that she's not aware that I'm doing it which turns out to be Adam who is then interrupted by Natalie who apologises for Adam being so blunt with me and tells me that both Lily and her (Natalie) both care about me and don't want to see me hurt, and that I should think carefully about what I really want especially as Lily's health means she will most likely die within the next couple of years and that's an optimistic estimate. (I probably should have made that clearer from the start)

So here we are, 3 days later, and we've not really got anywhere, with both of us taking some time to consider what we want and if we're ready for the potential consequences of engaging in a relationship.

If you've made it this far, thank you! I guess all that remains is to ask the question.

So, is there anyone out there who's experienced something even remotely similar to this? If so I'd love to hear from you.

For everyone else: Any idea what I should do next? Because right now every path, including just walking away, is going to cause a lot of pain for either one of us or both of us and I just don't know what to do.

**tl;dr**: Me and my dying friend (she has two years left at best estimate) have had sex and are thinking about something more serious but issues caused by her DID are getting in the way.

24520,Dating,259ph3,"So I dated this girl for a few months last year, until I started acting needy and pushing things too fast which caused her to back off a bit. I realised what I was doing then backed off and over the following few months things started improving again. Her backing off was also exacerbated by the fact that her ex (her first relationship) was still in her social circle and she was feeling guilty about dating me since he knew of me but didn't know we were dating. It's her only circle of friends (because she's new to the country) so she didn't want to make things awkward with her ex and those friends and end up alone. I still think she could have made an effort to make other friends but I still see her situation. She would have to be alone for a while and they're also from the same native background so she relates to them.

Then late last year a friend of hers, who is also from the same mutual circle as her ex, asked me if something was happening between me and her. I didn't give him a straight answer, I just said there was but wasn't clear on sleeping with her. I didn't want him to know because he's friends with her ex and I didn't want to put her in an awkward situation. A couple of days later after spending a day with her friends and seeing how this guy friend was looking after her and taking care of her, I acted out of threat and jealousy I called him up and told him we were indeed dating and sleeping together in case he was thinking of making a move on her.

So he told her and she got angry at me, told me it's her friend and I shouldn't have acted that way. I should have done it in an honest manner by at least talking with her about it first. She wasn't very nice to me, but a few days later she apologized for the way she acted and has apologized a few more times since then. 

4 months later, we have talked a few times and caught up again a few weeks ago. I was clear to her that I don't want to just be friends with her because I still have feelings for her as I did at the start. Today she invited me to spend time with her and her mother for mother's day. She was acting flirty, but she still feels a little distant. Yet she keeps bringing up comments referring to marriage, following up on a playful thing we had together about being husband and wife back when we were dating.


Should I stick around and see what happens, or am I wasting my time? She is still friends with the same social circle, and her and this guy are close friends but she insists nothing is happening between them (I also wouldn't think so since he knows her ex). I have strong feelings for her and she knows that I'm into her. Not sure on how to deal with this...

24539,Breakups,33b4ii,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost five years, and one of our biggest problems was his suffocating jealousy (which makes this issue so much more confusing) But first, some background.

We were hanging out at his house, and his laptop was beside me on the couch, when I heard the *ping of an incoming FB message, he was in the kitchen and we have each other’s FB passwords so I knew he wouldn’t mind me checking his message (this FB password swap was his idea not mine). Lo and behold, the FB profile that he is logged in as is a fake profile made up of MY pictures. He has used numerous pictures from my facebook/instagram to make this profile, and has even copied some of the statuses from my actual facebook page!! He changed my age (from 23 to 19…) and my city, but otherwise he has left things relatively intact. My profession is the same, he makes several references to my family (I have several brothers and no sisters) but posts some more flirty statuses than I would. Ex: Going out with my girls tonight, tequila makes my clothes come off ;) (WTF!!) 

After I am silent for a few minutes just reading all of this, I think he realized what happened and he snatched the laptop away from me. I honestly sat there stunned for a few minutes. I yelled, he cried. He told me that he wanted to see what “his competition” was, and that he was insecure and this gave him some control. He showed me that he rarely responded to the messages but he “thought it was funny to read to messages of desperate losers.” It slowly dawned on me, that he also had a very extensive stash of dirty pictures (some I sent, but he is also very obsessed with taking photos of me.. which I didn’t think was weird before.. fuck) and I asked him if he had EVER sent anyone these photos. First he said “No! Never” then he told me he had shown his closest friend, and finally that he had shared them to GW once but he felt so guilty that he took them down after a few hours. I am so embarrassed I feel sick. I am about to graduate into a professional field and if photos like that with my face were to circulate, my career could be ruined. I immediately made him delete all my photos from his computer, infront of me, but he is also tech-savvy and know how to hide that shit.

It doesn’t make sense. He is so incredibly jealous of any attention that I get, whether its from a stranger or a friend I make in class. If I tell him that I want to stay in for the evening, he makes an excuse to come over to my house because he was “in the area” or to drop off coffee or something. And it’s fine, I am not hiding anything, but I know what he is doing. He comments on my clothes, and once told me that I was “asking for it” in that shirt (because it had a strappy open-back) and he has told me he doesn’t want me to hangout with HIS male friends (yes, he is there EVERY time).

We are over, of course. I could never trust someone that violated my privacy in that way, and treated me so callously. I just need opinions about WHY he would have ever done this to me. What could he have possibly have to gain from this?

Let me share a little about this relationship. I met him a year ago online. I thought he was perfect he said he was 32 and had two kids. 3 weeks into the relationship I found out he's actually 43 and he FOUR kids, two that he gave parental rights up to. Three baby momma a and he was freshly divorced for the second time. I should have ran then. I don't want kids, I hardly like them, yet I stayed anyways. I feel like a complete idiot for staying. He's gotten so controlling and abusive in the last year that my parents are pretty much showing up today to pack my shit and get me out while he's at work. 

How is he abusive you may ask? Along with how did I not see it? He makes everything seem imminent. He always guilted me into staying home when I wanted to go out. Constantly accusing me of cheating, always gas lighting me. He works part time making shit money, whereas I have a great job and in comfortable. He has put me in a financial hole of almost $3,000. That's how much he owes me. He sold his car for $8,000 and gave me $100 and said don't say I never do anything for you he withholds sex as a punishment, he's addicted to pain meds and I am constantly stuck watching his kids. I may have never realized how unhealthy my relationship is without this sub. 

I gave up my dog for him. I gave my dog to my ex boyfriend. This is the first unhealthy relationship I have ever been in and I can tell you now, it's the last. A little tip is if you feel something isn't right, deep down in your gut, LISTEN. RUN.

If you look at my post history, you'll see that I was once in a committed relationship (married for over a decade). Long story short, my wife has left our family, found steady pay, an apartment, a boyfriend, and a life altogether beyond our marriage and family. Now here I am, in my 30's, with a steady well-paying job and two young boys that I am raising on my own.
I waited for months after she moved out, basically holding fort until she sowed her oats, but I've since come to the realization that she and I were only ever close friends who had a poor marriage that we carried along due to our strong friendship...

...and sexual chemistry.

Now, despite the fact that we are very nearly divorced, she's dating, and I'm starting to date, she's made it very clear that she wants to chill whenever I'm free. Kid drop offs have evolved from brisk conversations, to conversations rife with sexual tension. We've both established to each other and ourselves that the marriage is over.

But, ultimately, I'm a single dad, and I'm desirous of the company of a beautiful woman, even if it's just a fling. And given that we've been friends for so long, AND know each other's tastes VERY well... I'm seeking advice from you all.

26071,Non-Romantic,270wuv,"So I posted my issue with her months ago when it first happened. Link to old post [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1on6dl/me_24_f_with_my_best_friend_24_f_last_night_had_a/)


Basically she tells me I made her uncomfortable at my wedding including the time before my wedding even though I did not feel I did anything wrong or acted any different. I didn't understand why she felt the need to explain this to me since all it did was make me insecure and feel crappy about a special and happy time.


I ask her for space after she calls me and we talk it out for a while on facebook, since I really did try to understand her point of view and move on. But after talking to her and hearing the same vague points she had to make I asked her to give me space and for her to look into counselling, in the nicest way I knew how, because she really lets little things get to her and I find she makes things up in her head a bit and stresses out. For instance, she was convinced my husbands best man was planning to go to a strip club and since I didn't like that idea she kept bugging them about it even though they repeatedly said it isn't her business and they weren't doing that anyway, they were just going to the casino and getting a hotel to play video games in.


Fast forward 6 month later. She messages me and says she is free to talk if I wish. We start messaging. I tell her I miss her but I feel I can't trust her. She tells me she can not trust me, I am guessing because she thinks I blew things out of proportion and pushed her away for so long. 


Our messages recently consist of me telling her how I feel and that I don't wish to meet up unless we have talked through most of the stuff online first. I feel like if I see her in person I will give in to her calm tone and seeing her face after have missed her so much.


The last two messages were sent by me a week and a half ago with no response from her. The messages basically said that if I make you uncomfortable I think we shouldn't be friends. To me I haven't changed in the basic person and who I am. So either you have been uncomfortable with me for a long time or perceptions of me and my actions have been misunderstood. I am not trying to be hostile and I know all of this comes off as hostile and harsh but it was harsh and crappy for me in a major way, which is why all this comes off that way. All I really want is a point where we come to a reconciliation.


After I wrote all that she says nothing for what feels like a long time. I don't know what to do. I don't know if there is anything I should do and I don't know if I should give up on the relationship. I am feeling very impatient and want to know what I should do now. It has been way too long and I have cried over this too much. This has been the hardest thing since I have never been this close to a friend and had such a sudden fall out. I have had crappy friends and people leave me and I don't mind, people fade in and out of life. It has not at all been the same with her and I am tired of hurting over her and over things that are so stupid.


My husband thinks I should give up on the relationship since she does not seem to have come to terms with anything and he thinks she won't ever tell me what I need to hear, which is that she messed up and she is sorry she over reacted (or a variation of that). In her most recent message to me the only thing that was apologized for was telling me in the first place. When to me the feelings were unjustified and coming from a selfish and petty place. To me it was making a big issue out of nothing, then acting like she said nothing to hurt me and the whole time she thinks it is my fault I am so upset because I got upset in a major way.


I need to deal with this since my husband and I are most likely moving to the uk for work for 3 years very soon...should I tell her? Or should I just fade away? I don't know if there is anything to salvage and if there is any point in trying anymore.


Thanks, and sorry for the wall of text...tried to avoid, but this has been going on for what seems like forever.

26074,Non-Romantic,3buqqj,"So my friend Betty and I have been friends since we were kids. We both grew up very poor and in domestic violence situations. We went down very different paths when we got older however. I got into college early, and she dropped out of school. I am renting an apartment in a big city, and she is back in our home town. I am in a healthy 3 year long relationship, and she has been with two men over the past two years who have treated her like crap. I have a lot of money, she has virtually none. Her ex was addicted to meth, so thats where all her money went. I was telling her for months and months to leave him, I would pay for her to move here,  I would pay her rent if she moved. Anything. She finally left him, after a 10 months of me offering to help her. She is now living with her mother.

So she started seeing this guy, Logan, like two hours after she left her ex. I was super happy for her! Because she finally is with someone who actually treats her right. She was talking about how amazing he is for weeks and weeks, and I couldn't wait to meet him.

So I flew home to meet him. And, wow. He is absolutely horrible. He is one of those people who thinks an argument is normal conversation. Betty asked what I had been up to recently and I told her that I bought the new Arkham Knight limited edition console (I know it sounds like boasting but this is relevant). He then scoffs at me. I ask what the problem is, and he goes on a spiel about how batman is terrible, and playstation is FAR inferior to xbox. I mention the higher resolution and frame rate, and he interrupts me saying YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID!!

Keep in mind this is about 5 minutes after meeting him... 

This continued for about one hour until I made an excuse and left. 


He added me on Facebook after this, and i accepted because I didn't want to be rude. I looked at his profile and all his posts are about mens rights, anti-feminism, and to be honest, how much he hates women (he made some good points about the lack of male-homeless shelters, but he also calls men the forgotten gender and makes a lot of kitchen/sandwich centred jokes whenever a female comments on his posts.). He wrote up a big thing about how the rainbow filters on Facebook are the worst thing ever because its basically everyone being sheep and doing it because everyone else is. 

So I commented mentioning hashtags when there have been massacres in our country, and that its a show of support.

After that, he messaged me telling me to shut up. And then deleted me. 

I messaged my friend and told her everything. How I felt, how upset I was, and how I was worried that she was getting herself into another bad situation. 

She refused to accept it, and would only reply with one word answers. And told me that he is just passionate. I said there is a difference between passion and rudeness. She changed the subject after that. 

I feel like she is looking at him through rose tinted glasses, because she is out of her last horrible relationship. 

We grew up together, and my fiancé says that for years she has been coming to me for help and then refusing it at the last minute and its time to cut her loose, and that she is toxic. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can stay friends with her after this. But I know she will need someone there to pick up the pieces when he inevitably breaks her heart.

26079,Non-Romantic,3euj9d,"Hello /r/relationships

I am a 23 year old male working full time at a major electronics retailer. My girlfriend (also 23 and also works at the same store) and I have been dating for a year and a half and she was recently presented with a once and a life time opportunity to be moved out to beautiful Colorado by her aunt. 

The reason for the move is because her Aunt, we will call her Shannon because thats her name, is very *very* wealthy business owner who is getting into the medical marijuana delivery service in Colorado and wants to employ my girlfriend because of her work ethic, organizational, and money handling skills. 

Aunt Shannon would be paying for our apartment (my girlfriend wants to kick her back some rent money, which I am totally for. gotta respect the hook up) and my girlfriend would be essentially leading the office with paper work and gas receipts, all that stuff. 

I would be transferring from my current store to a store in Denver, however, I want to go into law enforcement (corrections) because I want to be able to provide for not only myself, but for my girlfriend. 

However, when I approached my mom about possibly moving out 3 states away, she completely flipped; calling stupid, that I'm not thinking right, that I'm moving for a girl and that, because she is going to be working at a delivery dispensary, that I would amount to nothing and become a pothead and all this other bullshit. 

Shes got a grip on me that I find extremely difficult to shake. I am Mexican american, so I've been raised to essentially do what my parents tell me to do. She's using everything against me; how could you do this to you sister in her last year in high school, you're stupid, you're going to have a kid and fuck up your life, you are being selfish. Everything.

I kept calm with her because I know that getting a yelling match with her will end up going no where. I told her my plan of transferring over to Denver and doing corrections in Colorado and maybe even seeing about other jobs or careers there. But still the same shit. Talking over me and not letting me get any words in. 

One of the things that I told her is why cant I just try to make it in Colorado? I'm 23 years old. My mom was out of her house by 18 and pregnant with me at 19. My biological father was out of his house at like 12. He immigrated to the states to find a better life. Why can't I just try? What if everything goes way better than expected and we do really well? Or what if it doesn't? If it doesn't work out, I see this experience as a life lesson; one my mom can never teach me. I see it as an adventure, she see's it as my demise. 

What it boils down to is me. I have to make a decision, weather to listen to my mother and do what *she* thinks is best for me, or take a chance and jump into the unknown, take a risk and see where it takes me. My girlfriend won't take this job with her aunt unless I go with her. And if I stay, she stays. I don't want her to stay because of me, but I know she will. I don't want her to resent me for it, which she says she won't but I would not blame her if she did. 

   
**tl;dr**: Gf's aunt offers us apartment/job in the MMJ business in Colorado but we live in California. My mother doesnt want me to move because she thinks its/I am stupid and I have no idea what I'm doing. I want to go to experience life and live with my gf in a different state. I need help shaking my mothers grip in my life. 


Some things to point out:

I have been wanting to move out of state for a long time. This opportunity came out of nowhere but the idea of living in Colorado has always been there. 

My mother is stubborn as fuck. She is person that thinks marijuana regardless of legal status is bad. Like heroin bad. She also thinks that the only way to be successful is to have a college degree, to which I have told her school is not for me. She has such a pull when it comes to my life and I can't say no.

The problem is that my parents had a very messy divorce several years back; both families got involved, lawyers, etc. The two families hadn't seen each other in 14 years prior to this wedding. Everything went well; my parents [66/m, 62/f] got along and talked. My mom even stayed at our house, which was neat.  

I [26/m] was the MC at the evening reception. During a break, an uncle [from dad's side] explained to me that the rest of the family was extremely concerned about my mom staying with us. They were questioning her motives, and memories of the nasty divorce were always present. I asked him point blank if there was any evidence that these motives were present currently, and he said that there was none. An aunt had told me of these concerns at the church wedding earlier in the day, but I brushed it off. 

At the reception though, I was put on the spot. My uncle--explaining it quite well and eloquently (and I look up to this uncle and am extremely appreciative of the role he's had in my life)--that he didn't want my mom and dad to go home alone together after their daughter's reception. He asked that I accompany my mom and home, basically act as a babysitter. 

The reason: She may accuse him of doing things that he didn't in fact do. I took a second to comprehend before mouthing the word rape…he said or something similar…and I said sexual assault…and then our conversation was interrupted. He was implying that my mom would lie about being raped/assaulted by my father, and that was her ulterior motivation. 

At that moment, in the reception hall with lots of family and celebration going on around me, I was shocked. I tactfully explained that I couldn't insult my mom by babysitting her. I said I wanted to celebrate and dance and hang out with family. For the magnitude of the conversation, it was a pretty civil and diplomatic exchange of words. Again, I look up to this uncle and his family. 

That being said, it's a huge insult. To consider someone [my mom] to be the lowest of the low and to leverage a moment like her daughter's wedding into money is amazing. To have that low an opinion of her, without a shred of evidence in the past few years. 

I understand loyalty, I really do. I don't have brothers, but I see how my family interacts. It's what helped me and my sis during the divorce. But it's weddings like this that should be catalysts for burying the hatchet. And when you ask the brother of the bride to babysit his mom because she might falsely accuse his dad of assault, it's a pretty big insult. My mom's a great lady (along with my dad). 

I felt like I was forced to choose sides, either my mom or my dad's siblings. My dad wasn't forced to allow my mom to stay with us; their relationship has grown over the past few years. 

During the wedding, I interacted a lot more with my mom's side, just because I rarely see that family. I love hanging with them. You become smarter by seeing people and having new conversations. It was so much fun.  

I didn't do it by design or anything, but I also feel that my dad's folks are judging me based on that. I don't want to tell my mom, dad, or sister about any of this. It was an amazing weekend where someone did something magical with someone else, and their image of it should be pristine and unpolluted. 

I'd never consider cutting my dad's side out. They've been real great to me. The uncle who had the preposterous request has always looked out for me. But it's hard to digest something that heavy. Any advice, redditors?

26129,Non-Romantic,2pk44y,"hey. i am typing this on my phone,  but i am going to do my best.   
i have had my two best friends for 10 (jack) and 8 years (tom) respectively. i have always been extremely close to jack. however, we have had an odd dynamic. example: he used to run/jaywalk at the very last minute across streets at the very last minute. he encouraged other people to do the same thing. jaywalking has always made me extremely uncomfortable if there is a lot of traffic (i got hit by a car on my bike once) so i would refrain and wait til there was a break in cars or the light changed. but while i would wait he would yell FAT!!! across the street at me and get others to do the same. obviously, this hurt my feelings a lot. body image issues have always been one of my biggest problems because of past issues with my father. jack has since apologised for the years he did this in high school. i cook dinners for them, am easygoing, am always there when they need to talk about personal stuff. i encourage them through their successes and support them through their lows. they will listen to my problems, do my hair, take me to dinner when i am broke and blaze me up. they DO kind things. they say hurtful ones.  
i have lost many friends by taking jack's side in arguments (even if my taking a side is just avoiding involvement in the first place). i am pretty loyal to my closest friends.  
 
&amp;nbsp;  

  
now we are in last year 2012/2013: jack and tom were not always friends. they are both gay and were trying to alpha each other; they felt like they couldn't both be the cool, fashionable gay one. they bonded over their cattiness and attitudes and became a dynamic duo of judgement. enjoying saying fairly things about random people, on the street, that they know, etc. gossip fests are their thing.  
some of this behaviour was targeted towards me.  

&amp;nbsp;  
  
they started doing things like:  
1.talking really quietly to each other so i wouldn't be able to hear, giving me looks, and implying that they are talking about me.  
2.walking extremely fast and with long strides (i am an average paced walker, but they walk to a point where i would be running to keep up) about half a block ahead of me having private conversations when it is just the 3 of us hanging out.  
3. making jokes about how i am lazy, comparing me to animals, that people i like are disgusting  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
i had a lot of people express their concerns over the way jack talked to me. the way that they treated me when they were together. i passed them off because that was just the way they are.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
   
it got to the point where jack and tom and laura(girl that is in rotation in our friend group, not really that important who she is) were picking on me a lot and teaming up to do so. i began having (questionably unrelated) problems with anxiety. i called them out on their actions as tactfully as possible. laura freaked out and sent me a barrage of scathing text messages about how i am delusional and how could i possibly think she was a bad friend(not what i said). jack and tom gave me complete silent treatment. i called them and tried to explain further, but they said the way i behaved made it impossible for them to not treat me the way they did. but they didn't mean to make me feel badly. i was crying and feeling horrible for a week. i felt like my behaviour made me lose my closest friends. i ended up having to get escorted to the hospital for a panic attack. doctor said i got to choose who accompanied me: the police, my parents, or a friend. i panicked. jack and tom took me.    
  
&amp;nbsp;  

  
i started group therapy, got a prescription for anxiety pills, and sorted things out with them. they expressed concerns for me, but never really apologised for the issues we were having previously. we got back into our usual routine of hanging everyday, doing the usual things, etc. etc. that brings us to now.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
2014: things started to go back to the way they were before my panic attack. they started speaking in hushed tones with me in the room and when i ask what they are talking about, it is nothing. they made up a mean nickname for me. they continue to tell me all of the guys i sleep with are disgusting. they said that i didn't actually get raped and am overreacting to a sexual assault situation on my birthday. i found out a running joke that they CONSTANTLY make about me having chickens under my bed is a reference to girl interrupted (haven't seen it)  but the girl is apparently has VERY poor mental health and past issues of abuse. when i say they need to stop taking jabs at me, they say they need to treat me that way to keep me in check. i tried a few times to talk to them about it but it ends up with them brushing it off or minimising their actions. i start to just say you guys are really mean or that is really mean to me when they say something that pokes fun at me.   
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
two months ago: i am hanging out with jack one day. i am running late and ask him for a ride about 10 blocks away which he agrees to. we are chatting and calls me the mean nickname. he then asks what would you even do without tom and me? all of my patience flies out the window and i said in a joking and sarcastic tone i don't know... be happier?  have more self-esteem?   
jack starts getting incredibly angry. i apologise and say that i didn't mean it to sound so bad. just the way they treat me is really mean. they do nice things for me (i. e. paying for my dinner or blazing me when i have no weed) but they say mean stuff. he says nothing, but gets up, slams the door open and leaves my apartment slamming another door shut on the way out.   
i am not proud for making a flippant comment. i texted an apology to him almost immediately. he said he was sorry i felt that way but did not claim any ownership to the issue.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
a few days go by, busy with work and thanksgiving. i text tom to see if he wants to hang out and replies with a very snarky message that i was too busy being unstable and freaking out. jack told him a different series of events in which i had said that cruel comment (did not mention the sarcasm, either) started yelling and slamming cupboards. i apologised for it getting back to him in that way. i didn't think they were bad friends,  and they DO a lot of nice things for me, but the things they say are very hurtful. he said he did not want to hurt me. i texted a similar apology to jack, but he never responded.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
tom and i like a few pictures of each other's on instagram, text a little bit, but our communication happens significantly less frequently. haven't seen each other in person. i text tom saying we should probably talk, he said that he was never mad at me and we didn't need to. i am slightly relieved. after a bit more texting, he reveals why jack hasn't made contact. it is for me to see if i really am better off without him.  
this made me incredibly hurt and i feel very manipulated.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
i make plans to hang out with tom. he has either blown me off to hang with jack or not fully committed to the plan and hung out with jack last minute instead of me. the few friends we have mutually refuse to be involved. it hurts.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
all of my other non-mutual friends say that i should cut them out. this is incredibly difficult. ten years of friendship, gone? i just want them to stop saying mean things or making jokes at my expense. i realise every friend group does this to some degree, but this is BAD. multiple people that i might not even be friends with comment on their poor treatment of me. asking me how i deal with them because they seem so spiteful and i am not.

26155,Non-Romantic,3i8vji,"**Background:**
When my parents were together, my dad worked a steady job and my mom worked odd jobs here and there. My parents divorced when I was 5 and my brother was 3.  My mom had been cheating on my dad with a 25 year older multi-millionaire she had known before my dad and her were married. There was no custody battle, my dad wanted us and my mom only wanted us every other weekend(Side note: my dad was incredibly amazing about never talking badly about my mom when we were young. It wasn’t until I was 20 that I found out the reasoning behind their divorce or that she didn’t want us fulltime). My mom moved about 3 hours away. After their divorce, my dad was very depressed and has told me the only thing that kept him getting up every morning was my brother and I. I love my dad, he did a great job raising us as a single dad for 11 years before he met my stepmom. In my state, my mom had a few years to file paperwork and claim part of my dad’s pension. When the time was almost up, the state sent her a reminder, and she filled for a percentage of his pension while he was living and to be sole beneficiary on the pension whenever he passed. This was a few years after their divorce, my dad was depressed and out of money to fight her. Retirement seemed years away, he didn’t fight her on it.


When my dad retired and had to do the paperwork for his pension, he realized what a huge mistake it had been not to fight my mom on it. He spoke with several lawyers and they told him at this point there is nothing that can be done other than her voluntarily giving it up and going to a lawyer to do it.  Unfortunately, my mom loves money, and she definitely loves free money. 


My stepdad (the man she left my dad for) fell into hard times after the 2008 market crash followed by some horrible financial decisions. My mom got a job for the first time in 22 years so she could have some spending money, but refused to work anywhere near where they live so most of it goes to gas and tolls. They have been trying to sell their home for several years with no luck, and his other kids helping make mortgage payments to avoid foreclosure. 


My mom has never mentioned the pension to me, or her cheating on my dad. I don’t think she knows how close I am with him and my stepmom. I love my mom, but on a more superficial level. I don’t know how to describe my relationship with her any other way, it is weird and a subject for a whole other relationship post haha.


**The problem:** 
My dad has cancer and was given 6 months to live without treatment, and with treatment they aren’t really sure how long, they have to see how he responds to treatment. My mom will get a large payout if he dies. My stepmom and 10 year old half-brother will get nothing. My mom knows what she will get if my dad passes (but she is unaware of his cancer at the moment). I don’t see her giving this up willingly to my stepmom no matter what. I think it is incredibly unfair that my mom would get anything. My dad worked his whole life for that, put me and my brother through school, and still has one kid to go. My stepmom loves my dad and has been there for him and my 2 brothers and I more than my mom ever was. Despite it being my mom’s right by law back in the 90s, if she takes the money when he passes, there is no way I will ever be able to forgive her. I know it isn’t my responsibility to try to talk my mom into legally giving the beneficiary status to my stepmom, but I feel like I have to try or at least let my mom know how I feel about it. Any advice on how to approach the subject with my mom?

   
**tl;dr**: Mom is beneficiary on dad's pension with large payout if he dies. Dad has cancer with 6 months, maybe more. Stepmom and brother would get nothing.

26178,Non-Romantic,2jbznw,"My 33 year old female coworker, lets call her M, has been dating a 27 year old male who we can call R. I know, these names are super creative. He has been back and forth with the relationship, breaking up with her one minute and getting back together the next. If she didnt have a six year old and and eight year old, I would probably back off and let the relationship run its course but I think this is really unhealthy for her kids.

R is a relatively immature 27 year old. His grandparents pay all of his bills. He does not have a job and he has no responsiblity. He is bad at communicating, but M is bad at setting boundaries. She is a divorced, single mom with two young children. She has never received any help from father of children and he has not been in the picture for the last five years. She struggles to pay bills, struggles with childcare, and struggles to find a romantic relationship. M has a bachelor's degree in psychology and a masters degree in organizational psychology. She has been educated on childhood development. 

R lives next door to M and that is how they met. After the first time they hung out/hooked up he started staying at her house. He skate boards and snowboards and the kids have enjoyed his fun personality. Her son often makes comments about how he doesnt have a dad, so I think M was very excited for a male role model to enter their lives (even though he's unemployed and doesnt pay his own bills). That being said, he's been very flakey. He leaves her wondering when he is coming home, wondering if he's going to be at dinner, wondering if he will make time for her and the kids, etc. Because he doesnt work, he doesnt take her on dates (no money). He comes over, eats dinner she has made, and hangs out.

Over the course of the last year, R's grandmother called M to tell her to break up with him because M only provides R with added stress (yes. grandma called to scare off M.... holy way too involved). Shortly after the grandma call, R broke up with M because he wasnt ready for the heavy duty relationship with two young kids. They got back together right away, but not before M told her children, R doesnt want mommy anymore. We dont like him anymore. Her son even drew a picture that said, I hate R and I love my mommy. Right after her son drew this picture, R was back sleeping in M's bed.

This R breaks up with M, M tells her kids, R decides he wants to have sex, M gets back together, M tells kids to like him again routine has happened three additional times in the last six months. 

I am really frustrated with M because her son is having some behavioral issues at school. I work in a psychology related field, and I have a strong hunch his behavioral issues could be a result of his uncertain home environment. I think M is modeling a bad relationship for the kids, too. It would be one thing if the kids werent involved in every break up, but they are. She gives them too many break up details and then allows them to see R stayed the night.  It has to be confusing to them. 

A break up happened again last week, but this morning M came to work stating, This is all my fault. I expect too much from R. My kids love him. We have to work it out. 

I am torn. This is none of my business, but then again it is because she is continually asking for advice. The more she tells me, the more concerned I am about the back and forth thing she is doing to her kids. At one point in time, M's family was concerned that R was being too rough with the kids when it came to physical discipline. 

I don't think any of this is extremely dangerous for M or the kids, but I do think its setting the kids up for low self esteem, continued issues in school and bad relationships in the future. How can I get her to see this? Or do you guys think I'm being a nosy bitch who needs to mind her own business?

I am thinking she might respond well if I could find some articles, some behavioral research, or some advice from other people who have been in a similar situation. Please share if you have anything to contribute.

26205,Non-Romantic,2wyswf,"My friend Sydney and I have known each other for about 6 years and have been extremely close for approximately that long. I have another friend, Loretta, who has been friends with me for about two and a half years. We have been pretty close for over a year now. All of us are 18 year old girls. Loretta and Sydney both have really bad depression and anxiety.




We have been hanging out in our tight-knit group and sat together at lunch for over a year and a half now. We all always got along and had no fights between us, until recently.




In December, Loretta finally decided to muster up courage to show us music that she wrote, as she is aspiring to be an artist someday. It was amazing! However, Sydney and I secretly harbored suspicions for many reasons, such as the voice Loretta claiming was hers did not sound like her at all. We were happy for her and thought we would be terrible friends if we accused her of lying, so we kept it to ourselves, even without confiding in each other.




One day, Loretta told us a successful musician has contacted her to create a collaboration album just that week. She told the name of the album and that the artist used a different singer that sounded just like her in the album. Sydney and I looked up the songs when we got home from school on Youtube and saw that the songs from the album were over 6 months old.




That is when Sydney and I first talked to each other about our suspicions, but we both felt really guilty for being suspicious and desperately tried to make reasons why she could still be telling the truth, but to no avail.




The next morning, I asked Loretta how long ago the album came out, and she confirmed it was indeed a week ago and that she gets 40% of all profits. The day after the Superbowl, Loretta told Sydney about how excited she was that the artist, without noticing her, has used her song in a commercial. Sydney is a media nerd, so she knows this is extremely illegal without release forms and is highly unlikely.



For the past several weeks, Sydney and I were trying to come up with a way to tactically bring up that we know she has been lying to us, because this has been eating away at us. This is especially tricky, as earlier mentioned, Loretta has very bad anxiety and depression issues. Sydney and I think those issues may be why she was lying. We both wanted to stay friends with her very much and wanted to avoid hurt feelings. We wanted to tell her while it's not okay she lied, we still love her and that she doesn't need that album to exist to be awesome.




This seemed really complicated to me a week ago, but it got worse. Way worse, and we haven't brought this issue up to Loretta yet.


On Snapchat, Loretta has been directly sending pictures of her and Sydney's ex-girlfriend named Julia hanging out to Sydney. Sydney has been extremely heartbroken about her breakup with Julia. I don't know how it feels, because I never experienced heartbreak like that, but Sydney tells me it's extremely painful to even see Julia.




Loretta has sent pictures several times after Sydney asked her to stop. One night, Loretta forgot too many times, so Sydney got furious. This was very conflicting to me, as I know what it's like to have problems remembering things, but I felt bad for Sydney. It's very hard seeing your two best friends fight, both of whom you care about very much. They fought for over a week, but they eventually (kinda) made up. It ended in Loretta crying and running away, and Sydney and I both ran to her to comfort her. Sydney was still mad, though, but she still wanted to make up with Loretta.




The night Loretta and Sydney began fighting over the Snapchat issue was also when Loretta told me she is interested in dating Julia, Sydney's ex. Loretta is in a relationship with a guy right now. I told Loretta this was a very bad thing to pursue, considering those facts. She didn't seem to care for that advice.
[Edit: now I'm starting to have doubts about what happened that night, as it was all a blur. I told her that dating Julia would not be cool at all, and that Julia would be a terrible girlfriend because she doesn't communicate at all, much like Loretta's current boyfriend. She said, Well he lives 30 minutes away, so it's different and I see Julia everyday. I don't remember the rest very well, but I got the impression that she shrugged what I was saying off, thus yeah....]



Sydney is also angry at Loretta for being rude to Sydney's friend, Daisy. Sydney told me Loretta insulted Daisy's interests to her face and other miscellaneous stuff like that. Loretta doesn't appear to be aware of this conflict.




So tonight, I did a very dickish and disloyal thing. Sydney said after she and I confront Loretta about the lies, she's going to tell Loretta she no longer wants to be friends with her, because she think that Loretta doesn't value their friendship, so why should she. Still, it didn't seem like a set-in-stone thing. I told Sydney about how Loretta is interested in dating Julia. Normally, I wouldn't do this, but Loretta is interested in dating Julia, rather than just having a crush on her. You can't help who you like, but considering hooking up with your best friend's ex is a bit different. I told Sydney this, as I felt she had the right to know this before deciding whether to continue the friendship or not. Did I do the right thing?




Sydney and I are planning on confronting her about the lies within this or next week. It may seem unforgiving and harsh to continue to pursue something from a few months ago, but we feel like this is necessary. Since we found out, we had trouble believing anything Loretta says, as this wasn't just one lie, but a lot of lies rolled into a big lie. This is unhealthy on both ends of the stick. It is unhealthy to have a friend you can't trust, and it is unhealthy to have friends who don't trust you.




We are going to have her come over to one of our houses so we can speak in private, but it will be really awful and awkward driving her home afterwards if things go badly. Still, it seems to be the best option right now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.




Would confronting her help, or would she continue?




Sydney and I know about really minor stuff she lied about in the past, which really doesn't matter, but Loretta does engage in untrustworthy activities. Loretta cheated on her ex-girlfriend named Tuesday with her current boyfriend, plus the dealio with Julia. She has also stolen stuff a couple times and drove while drunk several times. I know I'm being a moral harpy right now and am probably nitpicking just because I'm upset. She's not perfect, but nobody is. I screw up and do horrible things a lot too. However, the stuff I listed that she does (along with the other stuff in the paragraphs) contributes to Sydney and I having troubles about trusting in her. Loretta is not a bad person, but she does make a lot of bad decisions. Her family environment is very unhealthy, which most likely contributes to the decisions she makes. She isn't in therapy and likely won't be able to get into therapy in the near future.





An important note is that Loretta and I haven't personally fought about anything, but I distrust her for lying about the many lies she told about her music and how she's hurting Sydney.



Even though I am siding with Sydney a lot, I still care about Loretta and want to be her friend. However, I don't know if our friendship is healthy if I can't trust her. Is there any way I could gain trust in her again? Can you be friends with someone you can't trust? Should we keep being friends? 




Advice on anything mentioned would be appreciated, especially if I'm holding awful attitudes or have done bad actions, because those are really hard to notice unless someone points them out. I just want everything to be okay. I'm not going to attempt to help mend things between Loretta and Sydney, because that's between them.  If possible, I want to save my friendship with Loretta.

So update time. After the events of last night, my roommate came home with Future Roommate (FR for short) with the puppy (who is extremely tiny at ten weeks old). I was in the kitchen making food and said Hey let's go talk to Landlord right now. Roommate claimed she doesn't time because the office closes in thirty minutes. I said well make time because we need to get this figured out. She kept trying to be like we should wait till Monday they are busy.

I was said no we are waiting. This needs to be resolved. My main concern the deposit as it my PARENT'S MONEY paid for my half/rent/food.I hate having to even ask for money, so I do not want to cause anymore financial upsets for them.


So we go down there. Briefly re-explained the problem. So landlord said she hadn't talked to Roommate about this. Roommate said she talked about POSSIBLY getting a dog months ago with landlord and claimed that she said to wait until she got the dog to do paperwork etc.

Landlord was confused on that, but continued with the paperwork. So roommate has to fill out paperwork before the dog can stay blah blah blah. So until then the dog cannot stay in our apartment. As for as far getting in writing about potential damages not being my problem..she said to create a waiver of sorts that binds the agreement that any damages done by puppy will be her problem. If for some reason it needs to go small claims court, if roommate doesn't pay for whatever reason.

So I took the suggestion of several people about the deposit and my roommate pay me up front. I told her this, and she was like I can't afford that. While roommate was telling FR about the paperwork, FR made a comment about how I leaving in two weeks and this didn't make sense. I said well you guys could have waited two weeks and I wouldn't know shit about any of this.

I went into my room my food, where I am currently at. Typing up an agreement. Oh the few people who tried to make it look like I was the bad guy for making a problem out of this..I am not a pushover.

Edit: Turns out she doesn't even plan on signing the required paperwork. She doesn't see the consequences of getting in trouble with a complex..it's bullshit. Will be turning in a copy of the damage agreement and keeping my landlord in the loop. 

TLDR: So the conflict resolved (for now), friendship is damaged and am a little peeved at the dig by FR and at roommate still. Puppy cannot stay without all the needed paperwork filled out.

26225,Non-Romantic,38qgrz,"My roommate and I have had a pretty good relationship for not knowing each other going into the living arrangement. I was a little worried when he told he was recently out of rehab for a Xanax addiction going into it, but other than smoke weed, he has stayed away from other drugs. Within the past couple weeks, he hasn't been the same person though. He quit his job after working there for 4 months and ever since then, all he does is smoke all day everyday. He's not even taking classes at the local community college anymore. I don't condone his behavior, but it's not my life, and other than use my pots/pans and eat my food occasionally (which really irks me), he has not been unbearable.

However, within the past couple days, he has been acting really really strange all of a sudden. He was slurring his speech, having issues walking, and having memory issues. I saw him taking pills out of a melatonin bottle earlier today, and while suspicious, I didn't really think too much of it and wasn't about to ask him what he was taking. Following that, he passed out and started snoring heavily for a few hours. I was concerned so I looked into the melatonin bottle, and unfortunately it was filled with a Xanax generic. AFAIK he was clean for around 7-8 months, until a few days ago.

He just woke up, and I haven't told him that I know what he's been doing as of right now. I'm wondering how I should proceed with this situation. As someone that doesn't do anything but drink, I was really opposed it him smoking in the first place, but I let it go. This is definitely crossing the line though. I don't want to live in an environment like this. Should I tell him I know that he's using Xanax again? If so, how? Should I let the apartment management know what's going on?

26235,Non-Romantic,2mw2zm,"I have struggled for years with my relationship with my brother. Important to the story, we are both adopted (from different biological families). We were both raised in an upper-middle class household with two wonderful and supportive parents who gave us everything they could. 
  
Despite this, my brother somewhere along the line developed an irrational hatred and jealousy of me. He has stolen from both me and my family (including pawning some of my mom's treasured family heirloom jewelry which we never got back), been physically abusive, has irrational jealousy and rage issues and a really terrible victim complex. We know that he has several emotional and mental issues, but has always refused to attempt to manage or deal with them. He has been arrested numerous times, been in and out of jail, dealt with drug and alcohol problems and is generally the black sheep. 

Frankly put, he terrifies me. He is unpredictable and irrational and is impossible to reason with. He also has a bunch of guns, as part of his obsession with success entails buying guns as a means of showing off, which often concerns me for the safety of my mother, because I could actually see him attempting to harm her in one of his irrational victim-complex rages. 
 
I know it sounds like I should cut him out of my life completely, (and part of me would like to),  but I realize that most of this comes from his emotional and mental problems, and I want to be there to support him if he ever needs it. 
 
A couple of years ago, he met a girl I'll call Betty. Betty is from a really broken family situation. Partly because of this, she latched on to my brother as her family and easily manipulated him into cutting us off even further, casting us as the villains in every situation and making sure to make herself the hero who is just out to protect my brother from every perceived wrong. 
  
I could give a thousand examples of how messed up and irrational their behavior is, but in the interest of preventing a wall of text, I will simply say that his behavior has destroyed our family and has been really hard on my mom. My dad died a few years ago and she has been alone in dealing with this ever since. My mom eventually had to cut him off from supporting him (she has bought him something like 4 cars, paid for the contents of two apartments, spend hundreds of dollars in commissary funds when he's been in jail, constantly paid for groceries and gas, etc etc), but has made it clear that she will always be there to support him emotionally-- which he rejected as selfish and accused her of being a bitch that only cares about herself. 
  
Like I said, before, both of us are adopted. I had the good fortune of tracking down my birth parents a few years ago. My brother was jealous of this and lashed out at both me and my mother (because I got something he didn't have), but he never expressed any interest in finding his own.  

Recently, it has come to light that Betty took it upon herself to track down my brother's birth parents. It might seem like a sweet gesture, but it has recently come to my attention that when she gave my brother this information, she also threw in a bunch of manipulative lies regarding the situation of how he came to be adopted, making my mother (again) the villain: this time some sort of baby-snatching psycho who purposely kept his birth family from him. This could not be further from the truth.  
 
My mom is incredibly upset about this. My brother has refused to talk to my mother for a couple of years now, and only sporadically texts me updates (usually about how much he hates my mother and to point out how successful he is as compared to me), but has been blowing up my phone lately with hate-fueled texts about how great his new family is and how much he hates my mom for what she did....which was nothing. The fact of the matter is that his birth mom just now feels ready to make contact, but my brother's irrational hatred and victim complex is fueling this mis-placed believe that somehow he has been wronged in all of this, and it is simply not true. 
  
In general, I have made it my goal to stay out of the mess between the two of them and I try really hard not to be a go-between. I love my mom, but I think she enabled him for too many years. I care about my brother, but his behavior and his inability to understand that not everyone in the world is out to get him make him nearly impossible to deal with rationally. His wife has carefully manipulated him into believing a LOT of lies about both myself and my mother, and I am just at my wit's end of seeing my mom so devastated by yet another bunch of lies.

26237,Non-Romantic,2vr16n,"**Update here:** http://redd.it/2zlwo3

I am facing being disowned by my family because I am planning on moving in with my girlfriend next year. But first, a little background:


I come from a very conservative, driven family. My father has been very involved in my life and I owe a lot of my successes to him. He has worked hard to provide me with opportunities, to keep me motivated, and to ensure that I reach my potential. I am attending college on a full ride scholarship, due in part to my own hard work, but also as a result of his guidance and involvement in my life. 


That said, my father's methods aren't the best. While he only does the things he does out of love for me and a desire to help me, he has always been extremely strict and controlling. While this was somewhat necessary when I was younger, his approach remains the same despite the fact that I am now 22 years old. Essentially, his word is final - disagreeing with him is unacceptable and disrespectful, and going against his will on any major issue is grounds for disownment in my family.


For example, my older brother has been disowned from my family for marrying his now wife against my dad's wishes. They met at the beginning of college, dated for 4 years, and got married soon after graduating. While part of my dad's disapproval stems from the fact that he and my brother's wife do not get along, the main issue is that my father thinks my brother got married too young. Interestingly enough, my parent's relationship history perfectly mirror's my brother's (i.e. my parents met in college and got married when they graduated). It is abundantly clear that my dad regrets getting married so young.


So here's where I come in. After losing my older brother, my dad has really latched onto me. He routinely tells me that I'm his best friend, and he cares deeply about my success and my future. It's safe to say that I am the favorite child (I have 2 sisters as well), as I am the most like my dad in terms of my interests, and also the most successful. In fact, my dad and I get along very well most of the time. 


Unfortunately, I also have a very serious girlfriend. We have been dating for over 4 years now (since senior year of high school) and we intend to stay together after we graduate. While my dad actually likes my girlfriend, he is diametrically opposed to how serious we are. In his mind, I need to date as many girls as possible, and I shouldn't even consider being in such a serious relationship at my age. As a result, it is his view that I need to spend at least 1-2 years away from my girlfriend after we graduate to grow independently and find myself.


Of course, neither my girlfriend nor myself want this. I am planning on pursuing a Ph.D. after I graduate (I've already been accepted to several good programs, woohoo!) and my girlfriend is currently applying for jobs in the places where I've applied to schools. For some time now our plan has been to move in together after we graduate. Given my dad's opinion on our relationship, however, I have misrepresented this plan to him, telling him that we are applying for things independently but hoping to end up near each other. Essentially the plan was to pretend that her dream job and my dream school just happened to end up being in the same place and that we got lucky. 


As stupid as this plan was, it actually seemed like it might be working until a few days ago when my dad asked me if I would live with my girlfriend should we end up in the same place. Caught off guard I told him that yes, we probably would. That is when everything came crashing down. My parents are extremely conservative, and while they are not practicing Christians, they use the bible when it is convenient for their arguments. Thus, they are completely opposed to any form of cohabitation before marriage, despite the fact that they themselves lived together before marriage. At this point I think it is relevant to include the email that my father sent me soon after this conversation:

&gt;Family,

&gt;I learned today that [OP] plans to live with [GF] “If they just happen to end up in the same place”. I am appalled, disgusted and pissed off. [OP] you could not have dishonored your parents more than to make such a huge life decision without so much as even an attempt to get advice or consider the implications of your actions on others. Furthermore, it is completely against your families values and your faith. You have shown how ridiculously immature and self-centered you truly are. Becoming an adult does not mean you can do whatever you want, no matter the consequences. 

&gt;To decide to live together, not because of your undying love and commitment, but because it just worked out, is morally and ethically disastrous. It seems that in this case, neither party are willing to give up their own overly-inflated self-interests to sacrifice their individual goals for the other, but instead have decided to go their own ways, and live together if, by chance, their individual choices brought them to the same place. Wow…

&gt;Choices like this have immense consequences. None of you are even remotely emotionally mature enough to be making decisions like this without serious study, debate and mentorship. Avoidance of the discussion is yet another symptom of cowardice and immaturity. 

&gt;[SISTER] has shown the maturity and respect to discuss the possibility of living with [SISTER BF] at some point, with both her mom and I, both separately and together on several occasions. She is taking her time to consider this decision carefully, and how her decision impacts everyone involved. This is exactly how a mature, considerate, respectful family member behaves. To do otherwise is to disrespect your family in such an egregious manner as to threaten the very existence of your family relationships.

&gt;Let me completely clear. Mom and I are completely, absolutely, 100% against any of you living with a boyfriend or girlfriend.

&gt;While we have not had any real, in depth, discussions surrounding the ethical and moral implications of cohabitation, there is much to consider and discuss. I am well aware that your mom and I did it, and we both completely regret it for many reasons. A responsible family member might consider the implications of deciding to live with someone without first seeking the counsel and blessing of their mother and father in a decision of this magnitude.

&gt;I have attached a small primer on just some of the issues that you might want to consider before making such a move. I expect you ALL to read it in its entirety.

&gt;Dad

So, just to be clear, the issues with my dad stem not just from my decision to live with my girlfriend, but also from how I have approached the issue. I have purposefully hidden my intentions from him because of the example of both of my older siblings. Not reflected in the above email is the fact that my older sister broached the issue of living with her boyfriend 2 years ago and there was a similar explosion in the family. After much pressure, she backed down, and it appears she is just now reopening the discussion (I didn't know until this email). The fact that I hid this from my father is a gross betrayal, and proof to him that I am not mature enough to make these kinds of decisions. 


However, I certainly haven't approached this issue in a vacuum. I have discussed the implications of moving in with my girlfriend with multiple other people, and I have actually given extensive consideration not just to the consequences for my relationship with my girlfriend, but also for the inevitable consequences for my relationship with my dad. I simply haven't brought it up with my dad because, as he states above, I know that he is 100% against it. 


Nevertheless, I am not ready to lose my relationship with my father, and by extension, my family. As a result, I met with my father the day after he sent that email and tried to explain to him that I didn't talk to him about this issue because I felt that I couldn't, that I feel I can't come to him for advice on most issues because I am a traitor if I don't end up taking his advice. I explained to him that I want to be able to talk to him about big issues like this, but that I won't be able to until he can support my decisions even if they contradict his advice. Unfortunately, this was less than effective. My father likened my request for him to support my decision to live with my girlfriend to him asking me to support him in cheating on my mom. 


Not ready to give up yet, I then asked my dad what it would take for him to approve of my relationship with my girlfriend. My dad believes that my girlfriend and I are both too dependent on one another, so he prescribed that we live apart for around 2 years, and that he would support us getting married and moving in together if we are still committed to each other after that. However, he predicts that we will realize that we're wrong for each other during that time and break up. 


Now, I'm actually open to living apart from my girlfriend for around a year. I have no doubt we would survive it (we survived her studying abroad for 5 months), but logistically it does not work. With graduate school I will be in the same place for 5-6 years, and his plan would have us living in separate places. Thus, in order to reunite after a year or 2, she would have to quit whatever job she gets now and move to where I am. When I pointed this out and said that he's essentially requiring my girlfriend to make all of the sacrifices here, my dad did not budge. He told me that if she really loved me she'd be willing to do that for me, and that she shouldn't have a problem with it since I'll be the breadwinner anyway. (Just to be clear, my girlfriend is studying engineering and has career aspirations.)


So, at this point I feel like I'm at an impasse. If I move forward and live with my girlfriend next year, I will lose my family. However, If I capitulate to my dad's demands I will lose the love of my life. More than that, however, I will be reinforcing my dad's controlling behavior. Every major issue in my life, and the lives of my siblings, are approached by him in this manor. Up until now I have felt like I have no real control over my life because all of my decisions are dictated by my dad's wishes, regardless of my own desires. I've felt for some time now that things will eventually end badly between us when I eventually take control of my life, but now that it is happening, I have to ask if I am making the right decision.

Sorry if any of this is nonsensical, or if there are any egregious typos/grammar issues. It's quite long and I'm not exactly in great shape right now. Also, I didn't manage to work in the fact that I am now an atheist, but I cannot tell my dad because that is also grounds for being disowned. That's fairly important, as I can't exactly argue with him that cohabitation is in fact morally acceptable while I still professor to be a Christian.

I just moved into an apartment with two roommates. I share a bathroom with 27M. The bathroom is connected to his room (they share a door). The problem is, there is absolutely NO sound proofing between his room and bathroom. When I am on the toilet the bathroom, I can literally hear the covers rustling from my roommate turning in bed. Sometimes I wake him up just buy entering the bathroom. The walls are THAT thin. I can only assume that he can hear exactly what goes on the other side as well.

I just don't want him to be able to hear me while I'm doing my thing in the bathroom. The walls are SO thin that I know he can hear the splashes from my deuces dropping. I am not kidding about this. I have been in his room while someone was using the bathroom and we both heard EVERYTHING.

26247,Non-Romantic,1twcrq,"Hi Reddit, I'll try and keep this as short as possible, though if anyone reads to the end I would be so grateful. My parents have been married for around 25 years, and migrated from the Middle East to where we live now about 20 years ago, leaving their respective families behind. My father's family are not nice people. I have tried to love them but I just can't. They have consistently bullied my mum over her weight, appearance, and character over the years; they show little affection to my dad, and resent him for having left them; they undermine myself and my younger sister. They are nothing short of vultures when it comes to my father. Anytime he visits them with a full suitcase of his own clothes, he comes home with nothing. They quite literally take the clothes off his back. For as long as I can remember, my father's family have plagued my parent's marriage, and things have finally reached a climax now.

The majority of my parent's wealth lies in property back in our home country, where they own two apartments and a plot of land. The smaller apartment's finances inexplicably lie in the hands of my father's younger brother, who oversees payment of the rent by a tenant unrelated to my family. My father's reasoning for this is to avoid the difficulties of transferring money from one country to another (my home country is limited in the way of internet banking), and the idea is that we periodically visit my country and collect months (sometimes years) worth of money in cash to bring home in person. So far, we have yet to see a single penny of this money. My father's brother claims it all goes on servicing the house, while uploading pictures of new cars and jewellery on Facebook. This arrangement has been in place for around 5 years. We are, quite simply, funding my uncle's life while struggling to make ends meet ourselves.

The second apartment is in the hands of my maternal grandmother. She lives there rent free, but my mother's siblings periodically pay a small sum of money to my mother as a goodwill gesture for having housed her. We are very tight on money, even more so since I've gone to university, and I am well aware these properties make up the bulk of all the money my parents have. We recently looked into the current value of this apartment, and it exceeded £200,000. My father's family also became aware of this fact, after my father visited my home country for the first time in 5 years. My mother told me it has been the first time in his life my father has been at the receiving end of genuine affection from his mother and siblings, and we now realize their motives. Since returning, he has become relentless in pressuring my mother to sell the apartment, rendering my grandmother homeless. My mother is clearly distraught at this. My grandmother is honestly the sweetest person in the world, who treats my father like a son. She has made the house truly her own, spending afternoons painting it herself, the place covered in pictures of her grandchildren. She buys fresh flowers every week, and it always looks so beautiful and homely and reminds me of her. To think of an 86 woman leaving the place she's made her own for the last 10 years breaks my heart.

Now, it would be painful enough if my father was to use this money wisely. He is, however, planning on giving it to his family. He has made plans to build new properties in my home country, all of which will be taken care of by his aforementioned brother. All of our money will be lost, so my 'uncle' can buy his girlfriend handbags and himself jewellery, and for my grandmother to fritter away on coastal holidays. They truly believe my father owes them this much.

I can't see how my father, a man of 54, is so blind to this. As the eldest son, his father passed away young, and he became the sole bread-winner of the family. They play upon his guilt for him having left the country, and have finally managed to build a wedge big enough between him and my mother that her opinion doesn't matter to him anymore. The long-yearned-for affection he saw from them on his last visit has seemingly depleted all of his logic, and I just want to make him see how detrimental his actions are for his immediate family. But how can I say to someone your family don't really love you, they just love what you can give them? It would break his heart, and he has a volatile and scary temper. He's never hurt me physically, but I'm afraid voicing the one thing he's probably always known in the back of his head will damage our relationship irreparably.

But here's the problem. Now whenever she try's to talk to me I can't help but be a dick to her. It's like she's being generally nice but for some reason my automated response is just to shut her out and not talk to her. 

Now she's always getting upset with me because I don't spend any time with the family (her and my sister[17f]) but honestly I don't have anything in common with them and don't like them as people. They're both very conservative church going people, and I'm more of a liberal person that enjoys staying out late partying or hanging out with my friends.

My mother often gets mad at me because I don't participate in the family or talk to her, but whenever I've actually tried to ever talk to her she always turns it into some sort of a lecture, and to be honest that annoys me because I'm fairly adult minded and independent at this point in my life and I'm making my own decisions now based on what I believe and anything she says will most likely have zero effect on any decision I make.

It's not that I don't love my mom because I do... I think... And I want to have a relationship with her and make things better but I don't know how. So I'm wondering if there's anyone out there on this subreddit that could help me with this issue?

26259,Non-Romantic,3gul2r,"So J and I met about a year and a half ago on a forum for collaborative writing. After a few months of putting in countless hours of writing together, we decided to exchange phone numbers, Skype, and eventually snapchat handles. We had so much in common and we quickly became close - texting each other from dawn til dusk every day, sending each other pictures of whatever we're doing or how we did our hair that day, having Skype video chats to talk about what was going on in our lives and what we want to write about. 

Everything seemed great until two months ago. Mid June she started telling me all about some serious personal drama going on with her family. I did my best to be supportive and stayed up late taking her tearful phone calls because she said I was the only one she could talk to about this. Suddenly toward the end of June, I wake up to a text from her saying that she wasn't going to talk to me again until August or so. That she needed her mother's support with all the drama going on in her family and her mother didn't like her having a friend so much older than her. So she said we couldn't talk until she sorted things out with her family. I let her know that I was hurt but that I'd talk to her in August or whenever she came around.

That very same night she texted me saying I'm sorry, I'm such an asshole. I do want to talk to you. I'll hide it from my mother. I'm hurting so much and I knew doing this would hurt you so I took it out on you. I'm so sorry. I  immediately forgave her and things went right back to normal.

Things were fine then for a month. Then out of the blue, she sends me a text saying I'll be straight with you, I don't think we should talk anymore. I need to put the energy I put into our relationship into other sectors of my life. I hope we can remember the good times and move on. I was devastated. I told her so but that I would always be here for her if she needed me. 

For two weeks, I heard nothing from her. I was so heartbroken - I  lost my constant companion. I missed everything about her even after the way she hurt me. I thought our friendship was really over until a couple weeks ago, she sent me a text. She said I promised I wouldn't talk to you again but I'm so lonely and I need you. I was nervous and pretty guarded when I asked her what was going on and why she'd cut me off again. She vented to me about her family stuff and said she stopped talking to me because her mother wanted her to. But that she needed me and that her mother would just have to accept that we were friends. She told me that she hoped she could rebuild my trust in her and I said I hoped so too, but that I was cut very deeply and had been very depressed so I was afraid to invest myself in her again.

The next day she asked me how my day was, then stopped responding to my texts. I messaged her and called her over the next few days, asking if she was okay. I told her that if she didn't want to talk to me again, so be it but with all the heavy stuff going on with her and her family, I'd at least like to know she was okay. It's been almost 2 weeks now with complete silence from her. At least the other times she had the courtesy to tell me we weren't talking anymore. 

I don't know what to do. My husband and the other couple close friends I have have gotten to the point that they're angry with me for talking to her whenever she comes back around and don't want me to cry to them about her when she leaves again. But I love J. I really do. I don't have a lot of friends and a lot of the ones I have aren't always around for me like she used to be. I don't know if I'll ever make another friend I can bond with like that, I don't even know how to. I've always struggled with depression and I'm at such a low right now. I don't know what to do if she comes around again or if she will at all or if I should even want her to. Please help.

This came so suddenly and I am so fucking lost and devastated. I haven't been able to sleep or stop thinking about it. I'll have sudden bursts of mental breakdowns and crying fits. Thankfully my boyfriend is here to help me. She died in Ontario and I'm in BC so now I have to fly out there with the invisible money we have asap. 

I am so upset and distraught and heart broken and I don't know if I'll ever get over this. My life was already in shambles before this happened and now I feel like I'll just never be able to recover. She was only 50 years old and died from a clogged artery. People say she went peacefully but I'll never ever know if there was a moment of fear and panic and if she struggled for a minute or two in pain. That thought will haunt me forever and I can't get the images out of my head.

I loved her so much, I talked to her everyday. I knew some day something like this would happen but I never actually thought it would be this. I knew because of her smoking she was in very poor health and i was constantly worried about her, I feel like if I didn't constantly worry then maybe this wouldn't have happened to her.

what do I do? how in the fuck do I get over something so fucking traumatic? I am living a nightmare right now. I had a a mental breakdown the other night I thought I was going to pass out. 

I know people are going to suggest therapy and I want to get some, but I don't even think I have any health coverage or health anything. I don't have a family doctor. This is something I'd always ask my mom for information on.

26286,Non-Romantic,1mutvg,"Well, I live with my mom and through out my life I would visit my dad every 2 weeks, sometimes a month, he was court ordered to do so and also paid child support.

My mom Bad mouthed him my whole life including my mom’s side of the family but it was hard having a lot of male figures come in and out of my life often and kissing my mom, it confused me and made me feel uncomfortable or sometimes i got tense, but i became used to it and became less affected by it but i will dislike seeing guys touch my mom in any way.

I was a momma boy because I only had her, I still live with her, but I am independent (to some degree) and don’t consider myself a momma’s boy anymore, but I love her to death

I would see my dad every 2 weeks or if he’s busy every month from Friday to Sunday, I would stay over. Now that I’m older I barely see him

When he didn’t have a women in his life, we were fairly close, and I loved him, i was always trying to impress him because I wanted to be closer to him, after all he’s my dad and I wanted him there for me, but if he was extra busy with work he wouldn’t really spend time with me.

But what was worse is if he got a woman, I kind of went out the door, every time he got a woman I become #2 and he'd spent less time with me and the time he did spend with me was Distant.

It was on and off with him getting women and then breaking up most of my life, so it was like a roller coaster of being close to him then feeling very far from him. I also had my mom’s boyfriends that would stay around for either short term or long term, nothing permanent. 

I had my Grandpas also, later in my life I would see them less, and one has died. They were like my dad’s, I remember either on vacation or when I lived near them I would just think of them as my dad and they felt closer to me. When I found out my Grandpa had cancer, I kind of just squatted there and cried, and my dad just stood there, I felt like I was losing a semi Father. It’s weird and hard to explain semi fathers, but I never really had a full father.

Now my dad has a wife, and I started to feel distant to him in the beginning but after he had my sister, and my brother it felt like an even greater distance.

In all he doesn’t FEEL like my dad, I know his Label is my Dad and I have his DNA but it doesn’t feel like my real dad.

So I learn from him, and seeing, and hearing from others that his wife would do things that would kind of push me out of the picture, not buying my things that I would need cloth, school, and not really do things for me, and not help me out. He would say I’m an adult when I was 18 and that if I wanted to go on vacation I would pay for it but his daughter he would pay for her vacation well into her 20's because she is a girl. And they joked about me turning 21 because they would have to pay child support and laughed in front of me( this last one was a shock to me because I didn’t think he would joke about that) And I was so nice to her, and started to feel close to her before that happened

It got out and they didn’t talk to me for a while, but now my family forgot about it all and they all talk but I just feel like the distance is the farthest it’s been after everything. I don’t think his wife after that ever liked me at all, she held a strong grudge but I didn’t want to tell everyone but it got out. My dad said after that that if there’s a problem to keep it between him and me and not involve family, but he regularly embarrassed me talking down about me or things I did to my family, I’m not perfect but I don’t go out telling people about all the little thing my dad does wrong.

He also got me a job working construction, and I didn’t want to do it and i wanted to start a business and work on having a better like. I don’t see myself working in an office or construction for the rest of my life, and I had issues with the guys at my job.

So I talked to him about it and he said forgot about your business or your entrepreneur thing, just concentrate on construction, do a good job so you can get a better construction job or be a boss or supervisor later on. I told him I don’t want that, but I feel like he thinks my ideas and my business won’t work that I don’t have what it takes, and he wants to do what he thinks that’s best for me for my whole life.

Idk, I feel like he gives me bad advice, puts me down, he just wants me to do what he wants me to do he said Listen if you want to do the right thing and get somewhere in life just listen to me and do what I say, I feel like I’m not as important to him as his wife or kids, and I feel like I don’t get anywhere the same amount of love I give him. And his wife sees me as a leach to her perfect life and family. The worst is I always called his daughter my sister, because she is, but they told her I’m her half-brother and she calls me that.

I can’t believe I'm crying, did construction for a while and did some of the hardest labor in my life, was at the bottom of the food chain and I really struggled and then this makes me cry.

As a kid I felt like I wanted him to be there for me and I felt like I loved him so much and in return he wasn’t and he didn’t love me back as much as I did him, not even close. I feel like to him I’m a leech to his picture perfect family. BTW he also only called me as I got older when he needed me to help him do  stuff for him not ever to hang out.

I feel colder towards him, my love isn’t as strong anymore, as you can see I’m getting emotional and crying so it’s still there but it’s easier now, then when I was younger.

Should I just cut them from my life, because I feel like they bring negatively, put me down, I never talk to him about anything else other than his Family or about what I should do or how bad I’m doing, we never really talk. So feel like just cutting him out, not going total rogue but just only talking to him when I need to, and not dealing with him. 
My grandma (his mom) thinks I don’t do enough and I should call him and my aunts say I should call him and that’s it also my fault, but I don’t feel like I would out in the effort I feel like he should, because it was always him not me. And I don’t want to be pushed aside again.

Idk Guys I’m confused, and need advice, Should I not talk to him at or just when I need to, I kind of love/like my half sister, and brother but idk

**tl;dr**: Dad and His wife, feel distant. They give bad advice, make me feel like crap, see me as a leech to their perfect life (well mostly the wife sees me as a leech), he’s never been there for me and always puts me aside when he gets someone else. I love him put I feel like I love him more then he loves me back and he doesn’t really care about me, more he wants me to not fail because I have his last name  and image not cause he loves me.

26294,Non-Romantic,2kua62,"My family has lived in the same home almost my entire life. When my parents married, my maternal grandfather financed the home for them. My parents paid him the mortgage directly. My younger siblings and an elderly relative currently live there with my Dad. My parents got divorced (my Dad kept the house and kids) and the financial crisis of 2008 hit my Dad very hard. My Dad hasn't found steady work for years. He got behind on payments, but my grandfather was merciful about this. My mom is not involved in our lives anymore...holidays only.


My grandfather passed away in July, and the estate is managed by my aunt. Things weren't in order when he passed, and I know it's a grueling job for her. We've always had a good relationship, but we weren't very close. My Dad has been catching up on the payments since finding work has recently gotten better, but he's still behind. 


My aunt has sent a 30 day notice of foreclosure, without any previous discussion with him. She hasn't only demanded the owed payments. She wants the insurance and taxes that supposedly my grandfather paid out of the goodness of his heart, but my Dad was completely unaware of for 20 years. He was always told taxes and insurance were included in his mortgage payment. I don't even understand how demanding for them to be paid back is legal! My Dad has been unable to contact her, and can only talk to her lawyer.To make this even more strange, my aunt had contacted me asking if I would be a legal representative for my mom a couple days before my Dad was issued the foreclosure notice. Why would she think I would overlook this to help her and a parent I minimize contact with?


My Dad is, in all likelihood, going to sell the home he built and raised his children in. I told him even if he could make all the payments (which he can't), it's not worth being chained to people that have shown themselves to have no concern for putting their own nieces and nephews on the street. Also, he could got to a state with better work opportunities. I understand that my Dad was given a lot of mercy. I'd expect a bank to foreclose, but not family (even ex-family) that is completely aware he was making up the payments. My Dad is a perfectly reasonable man that could have at least gotten a phone call to discuss other options.


There's no way I can help to cover the missing payments and alleged taxes/insurance. If I saved every extra penny for years, it wouldn't cover what their demanding. To make matters more tangled, I had received a small loan from my grandfather to finance college. I am very close to paying it off (2/3 was paid off when he passed), but I'm still sending payments to my aunt.


I'm so angry at my aunt for her decision. I haven't even called because I don't think I can be civil right now. So far, all I can think to do is this: pay off my own loan entirely (this is a large financial sacrifice but I can do it) with a letter stating that I never want her to contact me again, as well as call her lawyer with the same information. I don't think I have the power to stop the foreclosure, and I believe my Dad should sell, regardless of how heartbreaking it is. Is this the right decision? 
Are there other options we don't know about? Are there other factors we're not considering? Is my desire to cut off contact reasonable? I don't understand how there could be any other motivation besides greed and hatred for my father. Maybe she is trying to push him out because she doesn't want to manage the estate any longer, and wants to distribute the funds according to the will.

Thanks ahead of time for any input.

26303,Non-Romantic,22u9zl,"  In short, over the past year or so, my depression has worsened to a dangerous point, and it is all my mum's fault. A quick rundown of me. I am 18f living with my single mom and 2 brothers, in grade 9 I was sexually and psychologically abused by a sociopath I though was my friend(he was 5 years older than me and caused me to have horrible insomnia and ptsd, which has lead to me to develop severe symptoms of depersonalization/derealization, hallucinations and a few symptoms of mild psychosis). In grade 11 my ex-boyfriend tried to trap me in his house and rape me. I currently attend therapy, and have had a psychiatric evaluation. I am on depression meds, and have a wonderful, supportive boyfriend who I've been with for 2 years. 



  A year ago, I quit my job due to sexual harassment from a coworker (nothing physical, just verbal). I didn't want to tell my mum the reason, but my older brother told her without my knowledge. She called me in a fury demanding to know why I didn't want to press charges and call the police. I explained that I just wanted to leave it be, and that it was not worth the time, money, and pain (I went through a lot of useless trouble with my ex), and that just isn't the way I wanted to deal with it, and she should respect that. She yelled at me, saying that if I didn't want to press charges, I must be lying about the whole event. 


  I told her that after all the sexual abuse I've gone through, I wouldn't lie about it, and that her bringing this up was distressing and triggering me into flashbacks of my near-rape experience with my ex. She began trying to guilt me, saying If you don't do anything, it will be your fault if he rapes a girl!!. I told her to stop, and she yelled at me, threatening to call the police herself. I told her that if she did that, I would leave and go live with a close friend. She eventually stopped.

  A while later I went to volunteer at a youth camp as a counselor, which I do every couple months. It's a perfect escape from home, very refreshing and fun. I come home, and I discover that all of my things had been moved out of my room into my brothers smaller room. They didn't call me, they didn't ask or warn. They just swapped out rooms the minute I left. I got pissed, and she got mad at me for being mad. In moving my stuff they also broke $150 worth of games and CDs, and refused to acknowledge that they broke it. I got yelled at for making a big deal about it and for being selfish.


  Skip forward a bit, my depression is growing, I started shutting myself off from my friends and cut almost all social contact, minus my boyfriend and a few of my best friends. My guilt was overwhelming. My mother also found out that I had lied to her about a piercing I got, and told me that I am untrustworthy, cowardly, that I am the reason that rapists roam free, and that I am ruining my life, as well as those of everyone around me, and brought up many of my past problems. After hearing all of that, I sank into a deeper depression, had a severe anxiety/depression attack, and for the first time in my life, I self harmed. In my mind set at the time, I was convinced that she was right, that I was a horrible, lying monster who didn't deserve happiness. I decided that I needed to punish myself, so I got out a serrated knife, as I felt that was the way I needed to pay for my wrongdoings. By making myself feel pain.



  I felt myself getting lower and lower that evening. I was, however, able to realize that I needed help, upon seeing the blood from the knife. I called my boyfriend and he came to get me, and I stayed at his house for a few days, he was incredibly supportive, and helped patch me up, talk me through it. A few days later, my mum saw the bandages on my arm, and started screaming at  me *in front of my brother* about how selfish and weak I am, and how I'm trying to make her miserable. Never asked if I was okay, no sign of worry. Just anger and disappointment and accusations. At this point I stayed at my bfs house on average 5 days a week, as I would argue and have anxiety attacks nearly every day I spent with my mum, due to her flippantly insulting me on a daily basis through texts and verbal abuse.




  She tells me that I am ruining myself, and that my opinion in our family holds absolutely no value. She told me that she has little to no respect for me, because of what I have done, and that she no longer believes I am the strong woman she tried to raise me to be. This was absolutely soul-crushing. She was trying to guilt me...and didn't even realize that she was the problem.




  Recently, it's been less frequent, but my depression continues to grow thanks to my mother. She blames me for things my brothers do, yells at me frequently, accuses me of lying and keeps trying to separate my boyfriend and I. Every time we argue, she is condescending and hurtful, saying that I am making her look bad to my boyfriend, and that I am purposefully causing her stress.



  The main problem is that once in a while, she will go all caring motherly on me, and act all concerned and worried about me, sprinkled with I love yous.....and now I've found that I can't believe her any more when she says that. I feel that whenever she is cheerful around me, she is acting. She assumes that if I disagree with her on anything, I am just lying to annoy her. She will sit me down and try to help me through my problems, but the minute I say that she needs to change/do things differently, she gets mad and makes it all begin again....




I don't know what to do. She can not accept that she is in the wrong. I even told her that she is hurting me and causing me depression, and she said I was lying, and got mad at me because I am being unfair. Just last week I had a severe anxiety attack from flashbacks of sexual abuse, and she got mad at me for running away to my boyfriends house( because my house is not at all soundproof and I don't want everyone to hear my screaming/bawling). She also told me that I am overreacting and that I need to get over it. She has said that I am not allowed to tell anyone about these argument in fear that she will look bad in their eyes because of my lies about her, which in reality is just real events that paint her in a bad light. I have self harmed again because of my psychological problems, and I am scared. Scared for my life, scared that nothing is going to get better, because it seems to be getting worse....




  I want to forgive her, and move on, and have a relationship with my mom that isn't just fighting and pretending to be happy....But I just can't..she has damaged me beyond repair, and I don't know what to do..... In her eyes, she is a saint, and she just won't accept that she has hurt me. 




TLDR: Mum is verbally and psychologically abusive, caused me to self harm and become severely depressed, won't accept that she has done anything wrong and is the problem. Should I even try to fix the relationship?

26325,Non-Romantic,3b52xf,"We met about a year and a half ago through a game. We are only friends online, but due to both of us having very similar interests and not going outside often we got very close. At least to me we are, I have a warped view of this due to not having any actual friends besides her. We also live in different continents.

We talk every day, Skype call every now and then and she used to send me a lot of pictures, not of her, but just of various things.

The reason I feel I need to end our friendship is because I get paranoid about her becoming close to other people. I'm terrified I'll lose the one friend I have and this is causing me massive stress all the time and I can't help it even though I know most of what I think is bullshit. I'm also afraid of her getting bored of me and often think she's ignoring me even though I know she isn't, she's just doing something or sleeping.

This is having bad affects on my body and mind due to the massive stress as I think I'm depressed and have anxiety, I'm to the doctor soon to see for sure. I think ending this would help a lot even if I don't really want to because of how close we are.

Another reason is how little effort she puts into talking a lot of the time, she often responds with nothing but lol or xD or other variants of it which really pisses me off because I'm already irritable and makes no attempt at continuing the conversation. I'm usually forced to do it which can be met with another lol. The reason this bothers me so much is she didn't used to do it so often, only when appropriate or followed by something else.

The final reason why is because I don't want to try and control her due to my paranoid thoughts. I've managed not to do anything so far but she's begun doing something which has driven me insane, but she enjoys doing it and it makes her happy and I really don't want to stop her as she's had a tough life herself. I also don't want my view of her to become so warped that I begin to dislike or even hate her.

TL;DR: Massive stress from paranoia and afraid of trying control what my friend does to suit me.

Should I just end it or struggle through and hope it gets better?

26328,Non-Romantic,34osj4,"So i dont have a large amount of friends, about 6 good buddies. For a few years we would always hang out everyday, smoking pot, drinking on weekends, having a good time and what not. Well about a year and a half ago, i met my now girlfriend through one of my buddies girlfriends. All was well, me and her would always go drinking with them and what not, even 10 of us all went down to cuba for a week last winter. 

After the trip , i kind of started drifting away from my friends, and spending a lot more time with my girlfriend. The thing is, i am 23, i have a good job, graduated from college, good girlfriend ect. Now all my friends havn't gone to college, all work minimum wage jobs, still sit in our friends garage smoking pot every night. They basically act the same way we did when we are in highschool. And that's just not doing it for me anymore. I mean i do swing by my buddies house on occasion to have a quick toke/cigarette/beer to just shoot the shit about. 

Now it is getting to the point where they are mad at me for not coming around all the time, and saying im pussy whipped. Now that is not the case at all. I love every minute i spend with my girl. Like im pretty sure she is the one. Its not like she is forcing me to spend time with her, she actually encourages me to go hang out with my friends, and she dosent want my friends to feel like she is taking me away from them. It is completely my choice to spend time with her, as i don`t enjoy spending time sitting in a garage smoking pot all night, and going to the bar, or getting hammered every weekend.

The thing that bugs me, is that when 2 of my buddies got girlfriends 2 or 3 years ago, they would spend all their time with the gfs, and me and our other single friends would get mad at them for never coming to chill or what not. The case with them was they wanted to come hang out, but their girlfriends would guilt trip them or get mad at them for coming to hang out with us.

I guess im just looking for advice on how to explain to my friends, that they are still my friends ( i do still love my friends, and they are all my bestfriends), but hanging with them all the time, smoking dope, and all that other stuff isn`t fun for me anymore, and that id rather spend time with my girlfriend, without being a hypocrite.

Sorry if i confused anyone or some stuff didn`t make sense, im not very good at writing things.

26329,Non-Romantic,2z8nye,"So this is a complicated situation.

Last year, I graduated high school, and was looking for a job with no success. My dad, who is a doctor, got me a job in his practice.

I want to make this very clear: apart from getting me the job, my dad has nothing to do with my job. I see him around the practice, but he is not my boss, I do not report to him, and my actual boss, Sophia, has said in the past that my job is between me and her, and has nothing to do with him.

I do not like this job. It pays well, and once I actually get there and get going it's not too bad, but I hate getting up early and going there. I only work 3 days a week though, thankfully. As I said, once i'm there, I find the job fine.

To cut a long story short, last Friday my boss was out (she never comes in on fridays) and I did a ton of work (letters and scanning and stuff). She is always asking me to do scanning, and I never usually get around to it because there is usually too many letters and other things to do. 

So today, I came in with my dad. She pulled him aside and as I walked past the room they were in I heard [my name]... Saturday... tons of work... My heart sank cause I knew what was coming.

Basically she said that when she came in on Saturday, there were a ton of letters and she had to do them all. I explained that I got through all of the letters on my desk, then turned to scanning - when I was leaving a huge bunch of letters arrived, and I wasn't going to stay to do them (otherwise I would have had to stay until 6 pm). She said something like Oh that's not good enough you should have done the letters. 

I was confused by this because she is ALWAYS going on about the scanning. So I told her so and she goes okay well, no phone no internet let's just do hard work.

A bit later, around an hour later, I picked up the phone to ring my mother. What was to be a 5 second conversation turned into a 10 minute one as we got talking. I am admitting that I am fully in the blame here - I shouldn't have called her in the first place. That was wrong of me. However my boss didn't say a word to me the whole time I was on the phone (I was doing letters while I was on the phone, not just twiddling my thumbs) and didn't say a word to me afterwards. 

All throughout the day she was making little passive-aggressive comments: for example, when I said to my coworker, oh often the psychiatry letters are really interesting! she butts in and goes no time for reading letters, we have to work. I understand where she is coming from... but really?! She made it sound like I was settling in with the letters and a cup of tea and reading them! I was talking about glancing over them while I was folding them. Those sorts of comments continued all day.

It was only when I got home that my mother revealed my boss had emailed her essentially complaining about my work ethic. The way mum described it, it sounded like [my name] gets on well with everyone but is often really distracted. I don't want to nag her about it, hence the email to you.

My first reaction was anger. Then humiliation. I burst into tears. I felt like I was back at high school again, and she was emailing my mother because I was being bad in class. I was honestly so shocked that she would go behind my back and do that, and not say a word to my face.

So reddit, what are your thoughts? I KNOW I was in the wrong with the phone call. I know that was my fault. But I am just appalled that Sophia went behind my back and emailed *my mother*. It just seems absurd to me?

thanks for any help.

* Two summers ago, I found out that she cheated on her boyfriend (now fiance) with the same guy I was sleeping with. She was out of town and freaking out because her boyfriend found out and was supposed to drive up for the 4th of July, so she asked me to go see her. I still thought it was messed up, but I drove 8 hours to get there before her boyfriend did. We got to talk and I got her to calm down a little before he showed up, so that she could fix her relationship with a clear head. We all ended up having a really fun vacation with minimal fighting between them.

* Last winter, I caught up to her and another friend talking crap about me. They didn't know I was walking behind them, and I didn't want to hear it, so I loudly announced my presence and we just never addressed it. I barely even remember what they said, just that it was something hurtful.

* Recently, she's been planning her wedding. I've told her a few times how excited I am to help out, how I want to be a bridesmaid, etc. She kinda avoided it, which I figured is because they're still having relationship problems. Then a month ago she announced on Facebook that her sister in law is planning it instead. I told her it bothered me and she said her sister in law is just better at those things. So I got over it.

* Then she announced that she was going to skip my birthday to go camping in a few weeks. I'm pretty big on birthdays. They're really important to me, both my special day and my friends / loved ones' special day.

26335,Non-Romantic,367h0h,"I'm not sure where to post this so..here we go.

I'm 15 years old, male, 5'1. My dad is 52 years old, 5'10.  My dad and I are in something of a custody battle right now.  I have not been to his house in about a month because he has been, in mine and my mom's [51F] opinion, a bad parent over the years. He carries an almost complete lack of empathy and does not get involved with anything aside from the bare minimum.

Yesterday, as a celebration for finishing middle school, my grade took a trip to Six Flags.  While we were there, it rained. Hard.  This information will be relevant later.

When we got back to school, I began to walk to my mom's house like I had been doing for the last month.  I walked home and immediately took my clothes off because they were absolutely soaking wet.  I then got on my computer to play some video games.

I had been playing for a while when suddenly my dad walks in the door. He says that he has been waiting for me at school.  Apparently, that day, my mom and dad had made a plan that my dad would pick me up when I got back from Six Flags. They had not told me because they knew that if I knew I would have resorted to any means necessary to avoid going over there.  I was still at my computer, and I told my dad, straight up, that I wasn't going with him.  I did this again and again until he threatened to drag me out of the house and to his car (keep in mind I'm almost entirely naked at this point, and there is concrete, rocks, and broken glass between us and the car).  I said well I'm not going and he grabbed me and tried to drag me out the door. I resisted as hard as I could and after about 5 feet he set me down and started crying.  He told me that he had been torn apart by my not being there (which I frankly do not believe due to the fact that the last time we had seen each other, which was a week ago today, he had made very little effort to communicate with me).  I remained adamant that I wouldn't go.

At this point he started trying to drag me again. At this point I made the loudest noise I could because my mom was working upstairs (it's a complicated situation that I'd rather not explain right now).  After about 30 seconds, after he had gotten me out the door, my mom showed up and asked what was going on. She didn't intervene because she thought that if she did it could be seen as her trying to keep me at her house (a decision, in hindsight, I agree with).  My dad and I were engaged in a de facto tug of war at this point, when my dad let go of my arm and I fell to the ground, cutting my back and knee, because I was yet still almost naked.  He grabbed my legs at that point and I started trying to kick at him to get away.  I said under my breath fuck you which he heard, and bent down with my legs still in his hands, and asked what the fuck I had just said to him. At this point my legs are in something of a pike position.  My knees are touching the sides of my face. This is constricting my breathing so I manage to gasp out I can't breathe.  At this point he lets go, but I believe he only did that because my mom was there. I honestly think that if my mom wasn't there, he would have held me in that position until I passed out so that he could drag me to his car with no resistance.

At this point, he once again sits down and starts crying.  He again attempts to convince me to come with him, but after what had just happened, I am even more adamant that I will not go. He eventually gives up and leaves.

So now we just called the police to report this, we told them what had happened, and they said that my dad had not done anything against the law. They said that he would call him and tell him to take a gentler approach next time, but that there was nothing they could do.  I refuse to believe that what he did doesn't constitute assault and battery.  There are cuts on my back and knee at this moment, and since the police said that he didn't do anything wrong, I'm not sure where to go.

Reddit, please help me out here. I'm confused as to what I should do next.


TL;DR dad tried to drag me out of mom's house, cops called, cops said nothing was wrong, not sure what to do.

My father and I have a difficult relationship. When I was very young he was a great dad, but around age 10, his mental ilnesses became really awful and he refused to get help. He was sent to Iraq with the Air Force and he came back a totally different person. He had some of these problems before he left, but I think his war experiences exasperated his Bipolar Disorder and he then developed PTSD from having to do certain horrible things that he has only ever given me a few details of. He was very abusive to my mother, my younger sister and me. Only struck my sister once as far as I know. But he was verbally abusive and a very scary person to live with. He had a great job and would spend all his income on frivolous things, so much to the point that we were very poor. I won't go into detail about everything but we were all terrified of him for most of my childhood until my mother divorced him when I was 16. 

After the divorce, he became very bitter, constantly blaming my mother for everything, even though it was his fault his own family turned against him. I didn't speak to him for about a year, while my sister would still visit him occasionally. 

He is now in therapy and taking medication but the damage to our relationship has been done. I don't think I can ever forgive him for all the hardships he put me and my mom and sister through. I didn't see him much during the 4 years I was in college due to me being in a different city. 

It's been a few years now and I moved back to my hometown after college, and consequentially see him from time to time. He is very good at guilting me into visiting him. He's no longer verbally abusive, but constantly talks about how lonely his is, how his family has abandoned him and that he has no friends, which is difficult to listen to. I feel that no matter how often my sister and me visit/spend time with him, it's never enough. We are both adults now with our own lives and interests and we don't even see our mother as frequently anymore. His immediate family (mother and brother) see him frequently and his lifelong friends constantly try to reach out to him. He is severely depressed, but doesn't attempt to do anything to change his situation, such as meeting with friends or doing anything other than sit at his house. 

I know that I cannot make him do anything and while I'm not close with him, he is my father and his health is poor. I don't want him to die alone with no one around him. I've spoken with him several times about the mood of the situations where I see him, but he never changes and always has to bring up the fact my mother divorced him and took his family, or how lonely he is, etc. Nothing anyone says to him can make him believe that he isn't alone, and that there are lots of people who care about him, despite his problems. 

I don't think he will ever change and even though I see him once a month or so, it's very stressful for me because I have no idea how to comfort him or make him feel that he isn't alone. I can really only stand to be around him for a few hours at a time, and even that is draining. I'm a very positive person and it's hard for me to listen to someone who refuses to get help, but constantly complains about how awful his life is and how the only reason he doesn't kill himself is because of my sister and me. He's my father and I do care about him, but he's a broken record everytime I see him and it makes me very uncomfortable, especially when he says that he wishes he had never come home from the war and that he wants to die. 

How can I learn to deal with this, or should I distance myself from him further? Is there anything I can do to help him and also preserve myself?

They even creek when my cat walks around in certain spots, thats how bad it is. I do not wear shoes in my apartment, I am always barefoot and have made a conscious effort to constantly tip toe around, even during the day because of what I'm dealing with.

My downstairs neighbor bangs on his ceiling and yells at me through the floor in the morning when I get ready for work (8am), and at night when I get ready for bed (around midnight). All I am doing is walking as softly as I can. I'm not even walking comfortably or normally. I don't have parties, I don't listen to loud music or television, and everyday I'm being yelled at for walking.
 
Last night I woke up around 2am to pee, and as I tip toed to the bathroom as quietly as I could, I hear banging coming from below me followed by GO TO BED! I laid awake in bed until 5am after that because my anxiety shot through the roof and I just couldn't let it go because I was so angry.
 
I do not know this guy. I don't know if he's psychotic insomniac or just an asshole. I sympathize because this building is old and the floors in my room are creeky as fuck, and I think his bedroom is directly below mine. I hear the people who live above me walking around constantly, but I would never in my right mind yell and bang at someone I didn't know on a regular basis just for walking. If it kept me up at night, I would buy earplugs.

This situation is causing me to feel unsafe and uncomfortable in my own apartment. I'm worried this is going to escalate because I don't see how I can stop the floors from being so damn loud.

So I go to school with these two people. I've known them for years. We're all very close and we transferred colleges together. I'll mainly be focusing on one.

The other day they were video chatting me. I left our state for the summer to go stay in the south so they were saying they missed me. We're very supportive of each other, especially during the stressful school semester. Which is why what happens next confuses me.

Before I go any further I have to explain that I have severe anxiety and depression. They all know this. I had a mental breakdown last semester and ended up writing an article about it last week (in my post history if someone wants to see it for reference). They loved it and showed all of their friends and kept saying how proud they were of me. Their parents echoed what they had said and so on. Point is: my view of things is skewed because of my illness. So for all I know this behavior is acceptable. That's why I'm asking you guys.

A few hours after our chat they text me an image of them holding up shirts that say, poor whiskey-monk in colored marker. They said they were making them while we were video chatting. They turned it around and on the back they were, wah wah wah all over the place. I was confused because I hadn't vented to either of them in a few weeks and we definitely didn't have that kind of conversation during our video time so I don't know what prompted them to make that. I got paranoid and thought that maybe they were gossiping or complaining to each other about me. 

Like I said, I'm very depressed. I tried to kill myself several times before I had medical intervention a year ago. I got back into University, lost 30 lbs, bought my dream car, and am now generally doing the things I've always wanted to do like going to Comic Con. I'm getting better. But my life is really shitty:

My father was murdered when I was 12, my mother was physically abusive, I was sexually assaulted by a close friend my freshman year of college, I was living in a mouse infested storage room before I got back to school, and so on. That's not even half of my issues. My mentor says I have the worst luck because some shit is always happening with me, usually something stemming from my narcissistic and abusive family, if not a result of me neglecting something of mine to help them. They create their own problems and suck me in. But I'm not here to discuss that. Point is: my friends say my life is like a soap opera. 

I hate it. I hate my life like this. They know this. I try to completely block it out during the school year but it's still there. So when I saw those shirts I immediately thought that maybe I talk about my problems too much.

My therapist thinks I don't reach out to my friends too often. And I can count on one hand the amount of times I went to them to vent or for advice in the past six months. I don't like doing it because I feel like a burden. Makes me feel like shit. Like a problem. If anything I'll tell them things because they ask or because they hear me yelling at my mom over the phone in our apartment on campus.

So I ignored that the shirts bothered me and didn't answer. After a half hour one of them blew up my phone and said they want me to know how supportive they are of me and that it was only a joke, they hope I'm okay, they're so proud of my progression, and so on. I said I was okay and whatever.

Yesterday I went to vent to one of them. An old professor of ours commented on my Facebook and acted like an ass. He does this with me quite a bit. Then he'll turn around and admire me. It makes me upset because I want him to be in my life but then he'll be a dick to me. Back when I was his student he'd scream whenever I fucked up and used my mother's abuse to motivate my work. It's fucked up but I wanted him to be a father figure. I frequently left his class to sit in my car and cry because I couldn't hack it. 

So I'm telling her how much it upsets me and she blew up. Started sending me a flurry of texts in all caps, Wah wah, poor whiskey-monk! It doesn't matter! Nothing matters! His opinion doesn't matter! You need to stop letting it bother you! Forget about him and drop it!. 

I didn't know what to say I wasn't looking for her to agree with me, just to listen and stop trying to justify his actions. But then she does that. 

It bothered me a lot but I ignored it. Then late last night I suddenly got very upset (as per the depression) and felt worthless. That joke plays right off of my insecurity of being a burden, although I've never told them so they don't know that's a fear of mine. 

Well all last night I had a panic attack and started uncontrollably crying. I felt like shit. Like I didn't matter and that everyone must sigh and roll their eyes when they see my name buzz on their phones or computers. I'm annoying, a sack of shit, etc. Eventually I started thinking--convinced--that I should stop talking to everyone. That it'd be better if I wasn't around them anymore. Before I realized it I started thinking of suicide, which is something I haven't thought about since my breakdown back in March.

My father has NPD and they have been divorced since I was 1yo. I am now estranged from him, leaving my mother to be the largest influence on my life.

I have never had a lot of friends. I am introverted and I just dont feel the need to spend time with people, other than my boyfriend, but in the past I would always just chill with my best friend. One person at a time is enough for me, basically. Anyway, my mother has always been concerned about this, but to me its not an issue.

She also gets mad at me a lot, for being lazy etc. Maybe I am, idk. Its not important I dont think. What she says when she's mad is important. From when I was ten (or at least that's the furthest back I can recall) when she was mad at me (most of the time) she used to call me parasite, freak, etc. She also told me my siblings (who are much older than me so had moved out, leaving a very stressful one on one environment) resented me, sometimes said they hated me, because I was so worthless. 
She told me people only were friends with me because they pitied me and that I wasn't normal. She has also told me on numerous occasions that I'm autistic which is why I'm such a freak. And that I'm retarded. In fact her favourite things to call me are fucking freak, retard, and baby. She also sometimes got physical. One particularly bad time she kneeled on my back and hit me (she is significantly heavier than me).

I dont know. I am finding it difficult to be coherent. Bringing this up hurts, a lot. Nothing bad like what I've outlined has happened recently, but she still calls me names. She complains that I have no respect for her these days, and I honestly dont think I love her.

I also think her abuse, if it is abuse, has caused me to have really low self worth/esteem and causes issues with jealousy in my romantic life. I think I always search for something to be jealous about because I've been told for so long that I'm a freak and no one could put up with me.

This has been something that has been brewing for the last few years now, so I’ll provide a little bit of background info. If you want to skip to recent events then jump to paragraph two. 

My mum and my dad split up when I was three, and so living between the two houses has just been normality for me. My dad met my step-mum soon after and she has been around for as long as I can remember. Her and I have a brilliant relationship. As I grew up I spent 90% of the time with my mum and I would see my dad for the full weekend every 2nd week and every Sunday. I grew up not wanting to go to my dad’s sometimes due to things that my mum would say to me. For example she would reinforce the idea that going to my dad’s was a punishment and something that I didn’t want to be doing, along with the idea that my dad was some authoritarian bully. And so I used to be anxious about my time spent with my dad until about the age of 8-9.  As I grew up into my teens it became very apparent that what my mum told me was not the case. In my eyes, and in the eyes of many others, my dad was the very definition of a good man. He was logical, clever, rational, and above all else he loved and cared for his family with everything he had. I learned, on the other hand that my mum was a manipulative bully. To give an example she emotionally blackmailed me into changing my last name from dad’s to hers, something that I didn’t understand fully at the time but really upset my dad. She also asked me once who I loved more out of the two. When I replied that I loved them both equally and in different ways, she flew off the handle and it shook me up quite a bit. 

As I continued to grow up and was able to spend more time with dad through choice, it was apparent how wonderful a relationship my dad and I had. Some of the best memories I have are our yearly fishing and camping trips in the lochs up north. We would just take a couple of days to spend some quality time together and we really did have some amazing times. Towards the age of 18 my relationship with my dad continued to grow and grow and my relationship with my mother kind of deteriorated. A lot of the time we fought and really were at each other’s throats, a lot of the time about my dad. I should mention at this point that my dad had been seriously ill for the last couple of years and had had a ridiculously tough time. So when my mum got on at me about my dad it began to hurt deeper and deeper and I would become more defensive and more prone to outbursts in which I would tend to say quite hurtful things. Eventually when it came time to look at universities, my first choice was the one that was furthest away from home that I could go, to which my dad actively encouraged me. (It was very important to him that I was to gain my independence). I remember the day before I left for uni. I had spent the last couple of days with dad and we said our goodbye properly in his house before he drove me home. We were both teary the entire way. That next spring my dad was in the hospice, and two months ago he passed away peacefully with his family around him.  I think it’s safe to say that I’m absolutely heartbroken. And although I have a fantastic support network in my family, I can’t help but feel very alone. Especially living at home with mum.  

On to the events of the last two months.

In this time, my relationship with my mum has become very, very strained. I know that some of it has probably been down to the grief and stress. (I have been seeing a grief counsellor). However there are elements that are so much more than that. For example, mum has been very difficult about money. I had to borrow some money from her and gran to pay my deposit for my flat at uni. I don’t yet have the money to pay her back, and she wants me to give some of the money that was left to me by my dad as repayment. I have told her that this is not going to happen as I was given very specific instruction that the money was for my own personal use, not for getting myself through uni or living expenses. She even went so far as to tell me to ask my uncle to move my getting this money forward. As well as this I heard from a reliable source that someone had overheard her say that I would have “two weeks to mope” before getting back to normal. I don’t doubt this as it sounds like something she would say. 
Again I should point out another reason that I feel very alone. My mum is able to put on a public face to other people. Her friends and her side of the family have no idea how much of a horror she can actually be. She is very good at spinning things and I’m sure that to all her friends I have been the cause of no end of misery to her. I wouldn’t be surprised by now if I look like a problem child to them.

Little things like this have been happening frequently including her snooping around my drawers and questioning receipts that she finds and things like that, and I tried to put it to the back of my mind until last night. We were having one of our regular arguments about how I was ”ungrateful for everything her and my gran had given” to me over the years.  She knows this winds me up big time and goes on about it a lot to get a rise and I cant help but get mad. We were really having a go at each other when she turned round and said “I just wish it wasn’t your father that had died and it was me”. I had to stop and process what she had said for a second before calling her every name under the sun. It was a bit of a blur. She had tried to use my own father’s death to guilt me and to make my own father’s death all about herself. I just thought she had crossed the line. I had to leave the house and when I got back, she had put the door on snib, meaning my key wouldn’t work. The thing is she genuinely thinks she is in the right. I’m getting mad even typing it. 

It has gotten to the point where I’m not sure whether I want much more to do with her in the future. Whenever things got bad between us, my dad was always the one to talk some sense to me and would talk to me calmly and logically to wind me down. Now he’s not here, I cant do that and so the pressure has been building up and up. 

The only thing stopping me moving out all together is my gran. She is 85 and I love her to bits. If I did anything rash it would destroy her. 
My only consolation is that I have my step-mum and my cousins to go to at any time, and that I am away back to uni in a month. I know a lot of that is back-story, but any advice would be most welcome. 

TL;DR: Dad passed away and relationship with mum is strained. I want to move out permanently but can’t as I don’t want to hurt my gran.

26393,Non-Romantic,32wx87,"Sorry for the formatting its my first post. My boyfriend and his friends have a group text that they chat on all day. Today I saw a screen shot of my best friend's tweet and a load of mean comments from his friends about her. I had seen this about a year ago and got really mad, but my boyfriend asked me not to say anything so that it wouldn't cause problems. I had totally forgotten about it until I saw the tweet today and he admitted that it is a pretty frequent thing. I was upset because I thought we all got along great and were way too mature for this kind of stuff. My boyfriend doesn't contribute to the posts about her but instead is a bystander, which I let him know still upsets me a lot. The kicker is one of his friends in the group text is also my cousin who initiates most of the rude comments and posts. I asked my boyfriend to confront his friends but he thinks it's not big enough of a deal to cause problems with his friends over because his friends are constantly making fun of people in this way. The reason I was so angry was because the comments were very hurtful and a lot of them mentioned hating her in which my boyfriend said none of them have any valid reason to.  I asked if he would mind if I texted my cousin and politely asked him to delete my friend off of social media if she bothers him. Do you think I'm overreacting? I don't feel right staying quiet about this issue but I'd like some other opinions! Thanks!

26414,Non-Romantic,2mpzz7,"Hey, /r/relationships, as is pretty usual around here, this is a throwaway due to the parties involved being Redditors themselves.

I have known my friend [late-20s M] for almost a decade.  At one time he was my best friend and we had a really great relationship.  For the last couple of years he has been dating his girlfriend [early-20s F].  Over time she has revealed herself to be an emotionally- and verbally-abusive individual.  From what he describes, she insults my friend on a regular basis.  She tells him that she hates him.  She has swallowed a handful of pills and told him that it is his fault for her doing so.  It is a rare day that she doesn't yell at him for something.  Just recently my friend was upset and crying, and he stated she berated him for crying.  He hasn't given an indication that she is physically abusive, but she can be violent, such as throwing (and subsequently smashing) beer bottles against the wall.  Beyond all this she is manipulative, over-dramatic, and tends to play the victim in situations.  If she is confronted with things she has done that are wrong or hurtful, she immediately goes into a guilt-inducing (and in my opinion, completely fake) routine of I'm the worst person ever, I should just kill myself, thereby ignoring the issues at hand and causing the person talking to her to resort to comforting her.  Straight out of the abuser's playbook, she has isolated my friend from those who care about him.  He has lost many friends because of her and most of his family doesn't care for her, as far as I know.  He states that I am the only person he has he can talk to about her.

I know that in the past she has been diagnosed as bipolar, but I believe she falls more in line with borderline personality disorder.  I do not know if she is on her medication.  My friend has suffered from depression for much of his life.  He was on medication for a few months but stopped recently because he said they didn't help him (whatever that means).  I know that they both need therapy and medication.  Though originally from the States, unfortunately they are currently both in a country (for their job) where mental health is really not addressed, so there isn't much access to medication or mental health professionals.

The thing is that I am sick of all of this.  I have talked to him countless times over the past two year on breaking up with her and he absolutely refuses to.  He has an excuse for *everything* with this girl.  The worst part of it is that he knows she is abusive, he states he doesn't love her and that he doesn't even like her as a person, but he still will not break up with her.  He says he feels responsible for her and that if she can learn to be more mature then maybe someone can benefit from this relationship.  He says he isn't happy but he will not take the steps necessary to put himself in a better situation.  In fact he continues to take more serious steps with her (accepting a couple's job position overseas, moving in together, meeting extended family, etc.) while continuing to complain to me on an almost daily basis on the latest screwed up thing his girlfriend did/said.

I really care about my friend, but I am absolutely at my wit's end.  I never thought I would be the person that would knowingly turn my back on someone in an abusive relationship, but I also believe that I cannot help a person who does not want to help himself.  Our relationship is strained because of this.  I rarely can get through a conversation with my friend without there being some sort of argument over this girl.  I have actually been hospitalized and had exploratory surgery because the anxiety of this situation got so bad that I was experiencing severe stress-induced vomiting and stomach pains.  I don't like the thought of cutting contact with him, but this friend has become little more than an acquaintance.  And I shamefully do not respect him, trust him, or believe what he has to say, especially when it comes to his girlfriend.  I feel like I am a soundboard for him to talk to, but he doesn't respect or appreciate my concern or advice, as it is always ignored.

I honestly have no clue how to move forward.

26438,Non-Romantic,3fz1gk,"My mom is very anti-Christian. She's always been a very hippy-ish, new age person who believes in God in an abstract kind of way but hates the Christian religion. 

I'm a classical musician. I sing in choir. One thing my mom doesn't seem to get is that most choral music of the common practice period is sacred. Secular works weren't as widely published and aren't as well-known. And even as an atheist I have no issue with performing these sacred works, because as a classical musician I'm more interested in the composition and I don't see it as a ritualistic thing. I don't sing in choir because the music is sacred, I sing in choir because the music is well-written, technically complex, and beautiful - and also because it's a requirement for my degree.

Last summer I went on a trip with my choir to New York. It was an amazing experience, but it took a lot of begging to get my mother to support it because she looked up my choir director and found out how active she is in her church. She was absolutely convinced that this was some way of trying to convert me into a cult, brainwash me, and change my sexual orientation. All because she knows my director is religious. She finally accepted it, but since then I don't really feel comfortable talking to her about anything choir-related because I know she'll find something wrong with it.

I've just been invited to take part in a paid project by my choir director and I'm very excited and proud to be a part of it. This is my first real, paid choir-related gig and I never thought I would have an opportunity like this since I'm not even a vocal performance major. 

I'm a bit torn on what to do from here. I have a feeling that my parents would like to be invited to our concert, but I don't trust my mom not to react poorly considering we'll be singing all sacred music. It's sort of but not exactly a Christmas concert, and we'll be singing some lesser-known works. Not your traditional Christmas carols. I don't think my mom would mistreat my director or behave inappropriately at the concert, but I'm not sure I can tolerate yet another lecture from her about being sucked into that Christian bullshit. 

So what should I do? Should I invite my parents and just tell my mom that if she doesn't have anything good to say about it I won't listen? Or should I just not tell them about it and avoid the drama? I know that if I don't tell them about it and they find out, which they probably will because of Facebook, they'll be upset with me for not inviting them. My parents are helping me pay for my education so I feel that I have some obligation to keep them filled in on what I'm doing at school, but I'm just so sick of my mom's attitude. In her mind everyone has some kind of evil ulterior motive and she's just got the whole world figured out, and frankly I just don't feel like spoiling the moment with her negativity, and the last thing I need to be worried about during my first professional concert is whether my mom is going to throw a fit over the repertoire. But I feel like it would be rude for me to not invite them when they're usually so supportive.

26463,Non-Romantic,2x3uk5,"I have been friends with A for about 3 years now. We share a lot of interests and based on the time we spend around each other, I would consider us best friends (although we have never shared any secrets or emotional issues with each other). 

A and I come from different social backgrounds and live in different communities. My family is very much upper middle class while her family lives an area that is known for being a bit 'off'. Her family is also very loud while my own is quiet. We have always ignored these differences up until a few weeks ago as we generally got along well.

I invited A out for dinner with my family. The dinner was nice, however on the way back to my house she told an extremely inappropriate dick joke to my mother, father and sister (10). We were all a bit shocked and laughed a little so the situation wasn't awkward.

It was at this point that I began to look at her actions as a person on the outside. At my house, although she speaks politely to my parents she also burps loudly and plays really inappropriate YouTube videos loudly (the door cannot be closed) and I have to repeatedly ask her to be a bit more quiet and turn down the sound so my sister can sleep.
She doesn't come to school very often because her parents allow her to stay home whenever she wants and doesn't understand why everyone else has a lot of homework (I am taking the hardest subjects available at my school and am also turning up, so I receive homework). 

We went to a party a week later at another friend's house. The friends entire family was there and it was a very quiet, polite event. A constantly laughed obnoxiously loudly, made rude jokes, yelled and spoke in an irritating pretend-yelling voice. Even while the birthday girls family was trying to make speeches, she shouted out and laughed loudly at jokes between her and another girl.

I began to notice this behavior more and more at school. She doesn't seem to understand social cues and embarrassed me and several other girls on many occasions (in front of our other friends) by making jokes at inappropriate moments and laughing obnoxiously while we tried to have a serious conversation.

The other morning, she was being quite irritating and tapping her fingers, popping her cheeks and making silly noises so I asked her to please stop because of my misophonia. She asked what it was so I told her. Another friend of mine laughed at me and A just shrugged her shoulders and went back to doing it within ten seconds. 

My mother had to pick me a different friend up from school this afternoon and we really needed to go quickly. A asked if she could say hi to my mother and I apologised and said that we really needed to go. I had to repeatedly tell her this until it got to the point where she said am I not allowed to go say hi to your mother?. She said this several times and I had to keep repeating to her that we were really busy and couldn't stop.

As soon as she found the pictures she drove to my house crying and showed them to me. That night she kept talking about how she had to divorce him and how disgusting he is. But as time passed, she's stayed with him and stopped talking to me. I know she's trying to keep her family together for the sake of her kids, and I respect that. But I can't help this deep sadness for our loss of a great friendship. I haven't had that kind of bond with anyone else and now we never speak.

My friend, let's call her Amy, recently got engaged to a guy [21M] who lives five hours away, let's call him Dave. I met Dave in college, and we had a strictly-sexual thing for a while, but it fizzled out when I caught feelings (I'm way past over it, this was in 2011 and I'm now engaged to the love of my life). I introduced Dave to Amy, and they hit it off right away. I was so happy for them when they got engaged in March! He's coming down next weekend, and Amy wants to go out with him without her roommate, Shannon (name changed). The only problem is, Shannon gets depressed and risks harming herself if Amy does anything with literally ANYONE without her. I know roommates are supposed to support each other and whatnot, but this is a little extreme. Shannon probably needs professional help (I've seen the scars on her wrists...they're not pretty), but she will not accept it. Shannon is single, and Amy said she'll just have to wait until she gets other friends or a man comes along.

What advice can I give Amy to help her relationship with Shannon, allowing her to go out with her other friends/fiance without worry again?

26490,Non-Romantic,370m4l,"Hi everyone, So yesterday, my girlfriend and I [27F/28M] noticed that someone had vomited inside our garage and on the garage door. We noticed because when the door opened, vomit was raining down from the bottom of the garage door. It is a three car shared garage for our apartment building. Given the way the garage is set up, it only could have been our neighbor of 6ish months [40s M] who vomited. We thought about just reporting it to the leasing office, but decided against doing that before giving the culprit a chance to clean it.

So, I put a sign on the door of the apartment building saying To whomever vomited in the garage, please clean up your mess. Thank you. Yes, this sign was a bit passive aggressive, but nothing too bad. We heard our neighbor come home and my girlfriend looked out the peephole and saw him leaving/coming back in with paper towels, so we thought, Okay, cool, he cleaned it. All is good.

This morning, I moved my car back in to the garage. I noticed something taped to our storage room door in the garage. It was the note I had left on the door. Annoying, but it could just be a sign of Hey, I took care of it. I looked at the garage door and there's a clump of vomit in the garage door track. There are also now tons of ants all over that area of the garage.

So, what should my girlfriend and I do next? Another note would likely escalate things. Since the vomit is technically a health risk and it is drawing ants to the garage, should we report it to the leasing office (and not mention who we assume/know did it)? Should we do something different?

Thanks.

TL;DR

Someone (likely neighbor) vomited inside our garage/on the garage door.  They cleaned it but left some and now it has attracted ants.  What do now?

26491,Non-Romantic,3evmql,"I posted here before but I can't remember my login. I cut contact with my father, who was and still is emotionally manipulative and physically abused me if he got angry at my 'lack of success' or 'fuck-ups'. Anyone see that golden daughter article about the girl who went crazy by being so pressured by her parents. That's me, except there was additional manipulation,  and I'm also not self-sabotaging and crazy that I would hire a hitman. Definitely not. But you get my background.

I cut contact with the intention of reassessing my relationship with my dad, and told him explicitly this was not meant as a punishment to him but in order to stop these toxic exchanges where he would just shit on me. But it was meant to be temporary, though I didn't know how long I would need. During this time, my brother has also stopped talking to me as he has taken my dad's side (mostly from what I think is for his own survival and being manipulated to believe that my dad is the 'victim' here).

It's only been about two months. Really, hardly any time especially as I've been working this summer before I go back for my last year of school. I received my first communication with my brother in a long time, telling me that shit will go down if I don't establish contact. I asked what, and he told me that my dad is planning to write all my employers, my boyfriend,  on my school pages, etc. I don't know what else. I don't know how serious this threat is. My brother also proceeded to insult me and tell me what a selfish,  horrible person I am and that I am the same, if not worse than my dad. Fine. Whatever,  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because he's younger, still mentally and financially dependent on this manipulative person.

I've elected not to email my dad with this information because I am certain he will take his anger out, potentially physically, onto my brother. This scenario is not an option. I know my brother is a big kid now, but I know what it's like to feel like there's no escape and submit to all those beatings. Instead, I'm indefinitely continuing my no contact rule on my side, but will not be telling my dad my view on this no contact has changed. I don't know if this is a good idea, but it seems to be my only option, and would like people's opinions. My brother has also told me that my dad sees fit that he sabotage me because he's punishing me just like I've 'punished' him by cutting contact. Honestly, learning this has just cut any ounce of sympathy I had left for this man. I felt bad because he gave his life to give us a life in the US / a better education, but I see now that that was self-serving so he could save face for his own career and financial failures, even if that meant destroying all of our personal lives and mental health. Disgusting.

As for sabotaging my relationships and career...my boyfriend is clued into all of this so that does not worry me. He's supportive of me. Again, I dont know how serious this threat is, but Im not waiting around to see in the off chance it manifests. I dont believe my dad knows that I know. I am telling my employer vaguely my situation tomorrow morning, as well as the school to watch out and be on alert / take down inflammatory posts online (also, the most he can say is that I'm some horrible daughter and that I've selfishly abandoned them yaddayadda, unless he wants to fabricate something). I'm thinking of a restraining order if he goes so far as to actually try to sabotage me. 

Otherwise, I guess I'm looking for some additional thoughts on my situation. Any other routes I should take? Do I actually need to send an email that I'm cutting him indefinitely, at the risk of putting my brother in a worse position (another consideration of mine: my brother has suffered most physically and mentally,  and has had depression from my dad's actions but went untreated because my dad does not believe in mental illnesses aside from his own previous ones, and sees that talking to a therapist is embarrassing...but my brother sees that as his fault)? I almost think that maybe my dad is cycling through stages of grief and this is his anger part, but knowing his temper, this could just be his day to day reaction, as this is similar to how he pushed my mom out (another story for another day).

26493,Non-Romantic,399hnh,"My family has a very complex history, so I will try to keep it short.

My mother was a wild child thanks to her mom. Back in the day they partied with the Hell's Angels and traveled all around California and the rest of the country. Her dad was an Oakie who was brought up during the Depression and was a very stern man. I don't know much about him, but from what I gather, it sounds like he had a drinking problem and was physically abusive at times. He died before I was born, so I can't make an assessment about him.

My mom, during her years of partying, eventually got knocked up. Nobody knows to this day who the father is, but my mom gave birth to a little girl, who we will call Carol for the time being. Around this time, my mom started dating a guy named Scott, who ended up being a giant piece of shit. He ended up getting my mom pregnant with my other sister and got married to my mom. Their relationship was pretty bad. My mom partied all the time and Scott was physically and mentally abusive.

The straw that broke the camel's back was one night Scott came home to find my mom having a party. He was upset and took the kids and left. My mom panicked and never went back to her partying lifestyle because she didn't want her kids to grow up with Scott. Around this time, she met my dad, and my dad was with her when she divorced Scott. When Scott and my mom split up, he kidnapped the kids and hid them from my mom in an attic. My sister's haven't told me in great detail what happened, but my mom eventually found them. After all of this insanity, my mom and dad moved to the opposite end of the state, and I was born.

Growing up, Carol was not around much. She had a lot of mental issues and because of an incident of babysitting gone wrong, she became a ward of the state and claimed my dad physically abused her (in reality, she was spanked ONCE and she has not let it go since). She ended up living in a group home about 2 hours away and I didn't grow up around her. During the time I was around her, she was a compulsive liar. She lied ALL THE TIME, even about things that weren't worth lying about. I always blamed it on her hard upbringing, but I'm not sure what the entire deal is.

As time went on, she got really badly involved with drugs, particularly crystal meth. For a long time she was an addict, right up until she got pregnant with my oldest niece. As soon as that happened, she swore it off and has not touched it since. She was 19 when this happened. The guy that knocked her up decided to marry her, and they were married for a little while. During this time, my nephew was born. However, she came home and found him smoking weed around them, and she dumped him right then.

What happened after that is a bit of a blur. She moved half-way across the state and lived with a boyfriend of her's for awhile. He was a really good guy, but he had a coke problem and got too rough with the kids (they would play around and he would be too rough), so she dumped him and moved back here.

While living here, she got knocked up by some guy in town and gave birth to my youngest niece. He wasn't around for long, but he does pay child support. The other father has a completely different life on the other side of the country and barely contacts his kids here. It's safe to say that there is no real father figure in their lives.

After that, my sister dated a guy named Danny for awhile, and he was okay, but he was still a piece of shit. He tried to be a good dad, but he was way too involved with weed and ended up getting my little brother on it. Danny is out of the picture now after he skipped town with a bunch of other people's money.

Which brings us to today. I am home from college for the summer, and my sister came by asking for a ride, because her car was giving her troubles. She also asked me to get her wi-fi working for her. I agreed, and gave her a ride to work. About 3 hours before her shift was supposed to end, she showed up at my house with some guy I've never seen before. She had my little brother get her some gas, and she drove off in her car. About an hour ago, I got a call from my niece asking me to hook up Netflix on my nephew's Wii. I go over there and get it working, and I'm noticing their mom isn't home. I ask where she ran off to, and my niece told me She's picking up younger niece from daycare. I casually mention that she was at my house a few hours ago with some guy, and my niece flipped out. She got extremely mad and started trying to call her mom. It turned out that she had gone to the lake with some friends (probably the guy included) and was just now on her way to pick up the youngest niece. I thought that my sister was trying to get some me time in or something, but what caught my attention was the way my niece and nephew were acting. I asked if this was a common occurence, and they both told me it was.

I've been sitting here under the guise that my sister was coming home after work, making the kids their meals, and all of that good stuff. It turns out that her partying habits haven't really died. My niece tells me that their mom will say I need to go pick up some smokes, I'll be back in half an hour, and won't come back for about four hours. And on the days my sister has work, she drives them to the other town to go to this daycare that they hate, and then has to go pick them up around 10 PM. That sounds like a really shitty way to spend summer.

I'm in a quandry here. I think it's shitty that my sister lies to her kids like that, but at the same time, I understand the need for time away. However, it sounds like my sister is spending way too much time away from her children, and they are getting sick of it. My niece was calling her mom's friends trying to find out where her mom was tonight. 12 year olds shouldn't have to keep tabs on their parents like that.

Before I left my sister place tonight, I offered to start babysitting her kids. Both of them are very keen to the idea, and my house is only a few blocks away from their house. After tonight, I decided I wanted to be more present in their lives so they had a good role model, and I think I'm taking a good first step towards that, but I just need to know what I should do in the future to be a better role model.

Kelly and John were super trashed, I was pretty level-headed. Kelly came up to me upset and said she was mad that John wouldn't dance with her. I don't know how it escalated from there, but they ended up screaming at each other in the parking lot.


Like a movie, Johns mom shows out of no where with her mini van and tells everyone to get in. John is so angry he is shaking and he is talking to himself. Everyone was telling him to calm down. Kelly was sitting next to me and was really upset. They screamed at each other from opposite sides of the car.



We get to John's parents house and John's mom is telling all of us to get inside. I was really annoyed. John and Kelly were, again, screaming in the streets. I started to feel worried for Kelly so I went to go outside. John's mom grabs my arm and tells me that they are adults and that they can handle the situation alone. I told her they were not fighting like adults and that they need to calm down and not fight in the streets.


John's mom and John's sister force me to sit down and I am not impressed with the behavior around me. They ask if I was upset and I said I was because everyone is really drunk and fighting.

John's mom and John's friend told me that no one was leaving. I told them that I would walk to my parents and that I did not want to be there.

I walked up and said the only way I'm getting in that car is if you take me to my parents. I felt really uncomfortable at this point and I started to cry. 


She told me I was being dramatic and I told her I was not and that her son was very rude to me, that everyone is drunk, and I just want to go to my parents.


She asked me to stay at her place 3 times. I said no every time. She told me, I don't remember how she phrased it that she was worried my parents were going to call the cops and I said no one is calling the cops (FYI JOHN IS A COP HIMSELF). When we got to my place she apologized for John's behavior and I told her it's okay and that everyone is not thinking straight and I was embarrassed that I was crying.



I knock on my parents door and told them what happened and spent the night. Kelly calls me this morning asking for a ride back, I say yes because I live with them and I wanted to get things back to normal.



I was expecting an apology from John. I finally broke the ice and said that was a crazy night. John freaks out and says Why did you tell my mother I am abusive and aggressive?! I said What? I never said that? He goes on to say this fabricated story his mom made up where I said I feel uncomfortable in my own house and that he's always like this.


I don't understand why a grown woman would create drama. I would try to tell my side and every time I would say something, he would say I am not giving you the time of day, your a liar, stop talking. He said he is never speaking to me again. That I know that he would never hurt anyone.


I told him if he was going to be like this then to pull over and my mom will take me home. He said No, Brianna just stop talking. Stop. I don't want to hear your voice. I was so uncomfortable and so angry at John's mom I started crying. I think he muffled under his breath that he didn't even want to hear me cry. I'm not sure. Kelly said nothing the whole time.


He has NEVER been like this before. I would not put up with this kind of behavior. I feel so uncomfortable with the situation.

I was urged to make another post about the real issue of my last post, the fact that my parents forced the break up of me and my boyfriend [31M] of three months.


My background: I lived at college for four years, did great things, never got into any big trouble, and I'm student teaching this coming semester. To save money, I just moved back home. My goal is to be able to move out at the end of the semester. Now...I want to leave earlier.


Issue 1: The Intervention


A few nights ago, my parents sat me down and did an intervention because they thought I was going to get dragged down the wrong path because of my boyfriend. My dad met him once, and my mom didn't meet him at all. Originally, my dad searched the public records trying to find his divorce papers, to make sure that he and his wife were actually done. He got divorced a few years ago. 


In searching, he found his track record with the police. It consists of: no vehicle registration (which was explained as not being able to afford it), no insurance (money again), driving with suspended license (after the registration/insurance issues went down), and arrest for being in a car with pot, which he does still smoke. Most of his record comes from his late high school days-undergrad (2002-2005), and then late masters, with 2010 being the last time he got into any sort of situation. The weed thing happened somewhere in the early 2000s.


They freaked out when they found all of this, and they yelled at me for an hour and a half about how since I'm a smart person, he must be controlling me and using me, because how could I ever stay in this relationship, that he's a deadbeat and isn't going anywhere in life because weed will always control him, and he doesn't care about breaking the law (even though we go to the same school, and he's working on his doctorate).


At the end of the conversation, my dad said that he would do everything in his power to stop me from going to his house, because eventually, I would start smoking, and I could get arrested if the police find him smoking around me, and I'm insane for putting myself in that situation because I have so much going for me, and I would screw it all up.


I called my boyfriend after the intervention, he was freaked out that my parents acted like that, he and I were afraid that my dad would call the cops on him if I left the house that night in defiance. He explained all the financial issues he had in the past (which he really didn't have to), but I knew about the arrest for the weed.


He was especially angry that my dad looked up his sister. His sister has definitely made some worse decisions than he did, and he's pissed off at her for doing what she did, but she's still his sister. He's distanced himself from his family, and understands how to deal with them. But, my dad thinks that since his sister has done some screwed up stuff, that my boyfriend is the same way. If I argue against that, he just says that I'm naive. If I argued ANYTHING in this, they would say I'm naive and under his mind control because love.


Extra info: He still smokes, only keeps it at his house, his last encounter with the police was in 2010 for registration. He's had his car insured and registration taken care of for the last few years. His parents couldn't float him when he was younger, so he's been on his own for a long time, as an adult should be. He openly says he's not good with money, but I'm not connected to him financially, so that doesn't bother me. But it bothered my parents. 


In The End: 


I met up with my boyfriend (even though they told me not to, because my dad thought that he would try to keep me wrapped around his finger, and my mom thought he'd capture me, or kill me, or do something rash) the day after this happened, because we knew that we needed to break up, and I wanted to do it in person. 


It felt more like an abortion than a break-up. We both think this is an extreme situation, and he was concerned that if we kept dating, my dad would call the cops on him. He was looking out for himself. We're still talking about this, and about the possibility of continuing in the future...just waiting until it's safe. He thought I made the right decision, but he also knows what it's like to have a person outside the family stick a wedge in the family, and he didn't want to do that to me. He doesn't think they're crazy, but that they acted crazy.


I had talked to my brother [20M] about all of this. He lives at home too, and he'd talked to my dad about it all. He's sane and analytical, and sees all sides of the situation. He said that most of what they said were scare tactics, and that they don't even believe everything that they said. But because they thought I was being controlled, they had to blow things up to recapture me, I guess.


My brother did calmly talk to me about one of the major points of the issue, which was yes, he did smoke around me, which I did allow. No one in our family is against smoking itself (even though my dad told me that because he smoked, he was automatically a drug addict and used other drugs too?), but my brother and parents were concerned about the possibility of me getting caught in the same space while weed was being smoked. 


In the end, I took that point and ultimately agreed, after my brother talked to me about it, not because of my parents. Even if it might have never happened, it's still a possibility. Not a reason to break up, but a reason for us to just not meet at his house. So, when I do move out and get my own place, we would be open to dating again, as long as my dad won't mess with him.


Issue 2: Father Surveillance


My dad suspected that since my boyfriend was broke, he was using me. Therefore, he must have been using me to buy gas. My dad went into my bank account to track my transactions, and in seeing what I've paid for, he could also track where I've been. This concerns me a lot. 


He also has the power to read my texts and track my phone through the family plan, and I think he can see my internet history through his computer. 


He says that he doesn't like doing this, and he rarely does (which I believe, because he would have approached me about a lot more in the past), except for in the case of when he thinks I'm in danger. However....he can still do this at any time. I can't forget that.


Issue 3: I Don't Want to Hate Them.


My parents don't do this sort of thing regularly. The last time they really screwed up in the way they talked to me was when I was 13. This is a .rare. occurrence. So, a part of me wants to believe that it's just a screw up on their part, that I'm their first child and that they don't know how to react to things like this with their adult spawn. 


Yesterday I asked my dad to have a conversation about expectations while I'm living at home, and about me moving out, and he said that on Saturday, we would all talk as a family and talk about anything we wanted to. He also said that we could go to a public place if I'm afraid of them taking over the conversation and yelling at me again. (I expressed my concern to my mother yesterday that yelling their thoughts at me doesn't let me think about any of what they're saying at all, and the scary part was that she thought they kept their voices down and that they handled it really well (it was a barrage of emotions and information). She also mentioned that she doesn't really remember anything of what she said that night, which is kind of frightening. She wasn't drunk.)


So here I am. My parents stepped over their boundaries by threatening me to break up with my boyfriend, but they're also letting me speak my opinions to them tomorrow. I don't know what to feel. It all happened really fast. 


They're not bad people. They raised me well, and they've given a ton of time and money (but not really emotional support or financial knowledge) into the success of my future....but at this point, they need to accept that I'm not a project anymore, and if I screw up, it's my own damn fault, and doesn't reflect poorly on them. 


My dad's mentioned several times that I can make my own decisions, and I don't have to listen to what they say, but compare that to I will do anything in my power to stop you from seeing him again, and I'm not sure what to believe.


I do believe that once I move out and remove myself from the surveillance, they won't bother me anymore. Just like in college, they had no idea what I was doing there, but they assumed everything was fine. We didn't talk much other than general texting chitchat. As soon as I come into their line of sight though, I'm suddenly in more danger, and the way they talk to me changes.


What is an issue? What isn't an issue? Should I be afraid of them? Should I go behind their backs to move my money into a new account, and buy a cheap phone so I can't be tracked? Disappear tomorrow to stay with a friend? Stay for this semester, save money, and leave in the spring? Is there any possibility that they can actually withhold me in their house? Do they have any sort of legal control over me?
   
Final Point: If you're going to insult me at all, at least pair the insult with something constructive I could do to make the situation more normal. Please please please.

I become really close to each of them (we usually hang out separate, but sometimes we all do), and lately now that I've come out of the closet I'm worried its not the best for me.

They know I'm gay, they don't care, but I haven't told them I think they are attractive in that way.

I sort of have a crush on them, but I don't think its impacting how I act around them, I don't get any urges to push the limits, although I wish I could.

I know its never going to happen (they are straight), and I do move on to other people, I just get worried that we are too close and compared to other people and their friends I don't know what to compare it to.

I'll meet one of both of them after work at night and hang out and eat dinner at a restaurant, we will meet and play video games all night and sleep over, watch movies, talk about our days, go on weekend trips, we will even go to the grocery store together and make dinner, etc.

Compared to other people I know and their friends we seem a lot more close, like being in a relationship without the sex and romance. Sometimes we get mocked for acting like brothers or sometimes I even get we act so gay.

I just really enjoy my time with them, I see other people too, but I just know with them its never a moment I'll regret.

I just get scared that my feelings are hurting me subconsciously. If I don't see them for a while, or do a lot, my feelings don't go up and down, so I don't see how ending it will make it healthier for me.

I just read other people's stories and they indicate I might want to let it go because I'm holding on to something I can't have. Even if they were females, no sex, or transgender I like them for them, they just happen to be people I am attracted to.

I just get scared I'm hurting myself and now just get freaked out every time I talk to them or see them and don't know if its rational or not. Its not me being freaked out I'm going to love them more, its more I worry one day it'll be too much or I should stop.

We all have our relationships outside this friendship, I'm not purposely using them for one, although I don't crave a relationship knowing I got good friends as much. I don't get jealous they are with other people, I wish it was me (maybe that's the definition of jealousy anyway?), but I understand its stupid for me to put thought into it when its not going to happen.

My parents have always been very good to me. They have provided me with the best education and support a child could ask for. They have done the best they can for my siblings and myself.

However, I have come to understand over the years my mother is VERY family oriented. Enough so that she will push away friends and other relationships to maintain the family.

As I have become more independent over the years, especially since leaving for university, this pressure to ALWAYS be a part of the family unit has grown tiresome. I have a life in the big city. Friends and personal interests I would rather be pursuing. Often my mother will message me, telling me to drop my plans and to come visit the family. This happens on a weekly basis. I don't find any enjoyment in the presence of my siblings or other relatives. They bore me to hell.

It has become worse over the years.

The worst example: I told my parents I didn't want to spend time with them this past July 4th. They wanted me to spend time with them and to help my brother move to a new apartment. I had made plans a month prior with friends to go to block party/ potluck sorta deal. I told as much as I would like to help, I was busy. They weren't pressed for time and I offered to help later in the week instead. 

*MY MOTHER FLIPPED SHIT*. She said that I didn't want to be a part of their family. That I didn't care about them. She would continue to support me through college and then said she would be done with me. She said she cancelled my ticket for a future family trip, because I wasn't a part of the family and didn't deserve to simply be entertained.

I freaked out, tried to come to a understanding with my mother and after a good talk had her nerves resolved. She never cancelled the ticket. However, the fact that she threatened me with essentially exile freaks me the fuck out.

She still pushes me to spend time with the family, and I try to avoid it if I can.

26558,Non-Romantic,3aek5m,"       Hello /r/relationships. 
To give some background. My grandfather has always been abusive to my grandmother. My grandmother used to be a very successful CEO, and in fact my family was quite affluent in the past. My grandfather (I say grandfather, but I have no regards of him as my relative) used to have multiple affairs-almost openly- spend all the money she earned, drink, hit her, and hit my mother and aunt. They fight a lot. I used to live with them. I was out of the country for a few years, so I haven't thought much about their situation. Maybe 3 years ago my grandmother had a stroke, which cannot be surgically operated on (she has a blood clot) due to its location, and her health has always been fragile as far as I can remember. She has blood sugar problems, diabetes etc... My grandmother was a strong headed, successful, highly intelligent and driven individual. That person no longer exists. The difference is shocking to me. 
       
My mom, even when I was little, has always worried about their situation, and has tried to convince them to divorce many many times. The situation has escalated to the point where my grandmother called my mother and said Come here now, I am about to die because of how much my grandfather beat her. No matter how hard my mother tried, my grandmother refuses to divorce, and refuses to let my mother treat my grandfather any different, saying that he would just further abuse her, and that why would she divorce at her age etc... Divorce is not in our culture. 

I know he beats her, but he never lets me see the extent. In fact, little kids love him. I loved him, too, when I was little, because he spoiled me while my grandmother tried to discipline me. I didn't like her much when I was little, but now ironically the situation is opposite. 

Onto today. My grandfather has a knee problem, so he uses a walking stick to move. When my father came home, he found that he had beaten her so much her ankle is swollen, she's been hit on the back of the head as well (VERY dangerous due to her post stroke condition!! It's almost where the blood clot is at!). She cannot even walk properly. There's no way he can harm her that much with just his hands. My mother and I believe he hit her with his wooden walking stick. I want them to divorce. My mother doesn't know what to do anymore, she really has tried everything. I want to get him as far away from my family as possible. I don't think even my mother holds any love for him. Nowadays, they are around my young siblings. Even more, I do not want this environment to be around them, even if he covers up around the kids (they love him). Today, when my mother (who knows what happened) asked her what happened, she said she accidentally twisted it. How do I convince her to get away from him? She will definitely not go to therapy or anything like that. Please someone who has experience, please help. I am researching domestic violence laws in my country (not the U.S.) and other legalities, however, I'm not finding good information. So additionally, if anyone knows more about that, please direct me. Mostly though, how do I convince my grandmother to get away from him? She has been through so much pain, my mother too. I just want this to stop.

Tl;dr: My grandfather has abused my grandmother for decades.

**Back-story**: I am an extremely involved community college student. What this means is that I am in clubs, volunteer, and have several jobs on campus, including as an SI (supplemental instruction leader). I've also won a lot of awards while I've been here. I won a couple last week. Today, I found out I won a scholarship. I'm also Hispanic and my major is dominated by white males. Alex is a white male. This will be relevant later.


I met Alex last year. We are both currently pursing degrees/certifications in similar fields. I introduced him to my boss so he could get a job on campus. We now work together and also are in the same club. Suffice to say we spend a lot of time together. 


Yesterday morning, I asked him if we were friends and he said he was my friend but I wasn't his friend. I was extremely hurt by this and almost cried. 


Last night, I received an email for a summer program relating to our major.  I sent it to him and asked him if he was going to apply. The email was forwarded a few times, in one of the messages somebody wrote that the program was looking for more people of color and women to apply. Here's the conversation we had:


**Alex**: Affirmative action? I have no chance. I'm sure you and [black guy who is extremely incompetent] will get in.


**Me**: I'm incredibly offended that you would even dare to put me on the same level as him. I am so far about him [skill wise]. I haven't been busting my ass off for the last four years just cause i kind of sort of like this. He only chose his major because we were talking about it. How dare you.


**Alex**: You were the only woman I thought of. Substitute Sara. My apologies. 


**Alex**: To answer your question, no I wont be applying. Why the fuck does race or gender have to play a part?? Fuck them. I'll succeed on my fucking own. I don't need stupid awards, SI jobs, or special programs to get ahead. I know now what my true calling is. 


I didn't reply. 


I felt like he was personally attacking me. Last semester he was going to be an SI  but they did not hire him because they were considering cutting the program. I am still an SI and he seems bitter about that. 


Today, I found out I was winning a scholarship from a Latino business. He said he was never going to win a scholarship because he is a white male. I asked him if he applied for scholarships through our colleges scholarship foundation and he said he didn't know it existed and that they're obviously not doing a good job of advertising because a person of [his] status should know about it. I told him there have been flyers, pamphlets, and it has been posted on our college's website.  



I think he is jealous that I have won awards, scholarships, and have jobs that he doesn't. I recently made a LinkedIn profile which listed all of my awards and I think that might have bothered him.

Also, he will ask me about how my dates go and if I will follow through with them, usually responding to my decision with something along the lines of well I'm gonna do something with her(keep in mind this happens very often).


This gets annoying, considering the first major time he did this was when he convinced a girl I asked to a dance that I didn't like her anymore, and got her to go to the dance with him. What really offed me is that he actually came up and asked me if I was still going to the dance with her around 2 hours before he pulled this shit. He's constantly lied about hooking up/talking to my exes or those who like me.


Other than that, he asks about what I think of his girlfriend or date (rate-wise, like 1-10 kind of cliché scaling), and when I say I don't do that he gets all mad and expects me to care about what his date looks like. 


A little recent thing he has done is friend my ex(who threatened to fabricate allegations for sexual assault and have me arrested[3 years ago was when that ended]) on Facebook, after he told me he blocked her and was sorry I ever had to go through that. You guessed it, they are now talking.

My boyfriend and I are a wonderfully, happy couple. We have many common interests ranging from gaming to outdoor activities. One of the aspects of our relationship that makes us click so well is both of us are completely fine with just chilling at home, essentially doing nothing. At the same time, both of us enjoy outside company from time-to-time (friends, family) and do not have a problem with our social skills.

That's where this post comes into play. We are wanting to become more social and have a group of friends we could hang out with every once a while. Currently that is limited to my fellow researchers at a university and our online gaming community. Neither of us drinks (through personal choice, completely fine with others drinking) so that already knocks out one way to gain a social group. At this point, we are at a complete loss.

Anyone have tips for helping couples find people who share common interests for hanging out? Not necessarily always doing the same activity (e.g hiking) but simply watching movies, playing games, going out to dinner, fun things, etc. Is there an OKCupid for couples?

They have always been the types of people to throw out the odd you're f*cking stupid Kill yourself. Derogatory statements like that which I took as a joke for the first little bit then it started to get to me even though they claimed they were only joking. The constant man, you're such a faggot, that was the most frequently used word towards me. Although, I am not a homosexual. When I asked them if they could stop saying stuff like that towards me they would say stop being a bitch even if they were joking because it was never apparent to me in the situations that they were being said and they always back eachother up when I call one of them out.

I'm just the type of person that gets along really well with people and I guess they took advantage of me.

During my freshman year of college, I lived on the same hall as a few other girls, who became my best friends throughout the year, as well as my roommate. We decided to live together this year, and it's been less than spectacular. I have depression, and when I told my friend/suitemate about it, she got very angry, said she had to go, and got up and left very abruptly. The others in my suite told me I shouldn't be upset, they got frustrated when I confided in them because my large problems made them feel that there's were insignificant. A whole bunch of crazy, which was especially hurtful as they were so supportive last year when my depression got bad. We haven't spoken about the incident since, aside from one of the girls talking to me while I was in the shower (aka not giving me an out). The other girls in my suite were equally unsupportive, aside from my roommate. We're cordial, but no longer friends, which hurts when I see them.

Now comes the problem. My roommate is taking a semester in NYC to work on her studio arts minor. Additionally, another girl in my suite got pulled to live on her sorority's floor. There are four of us still living in the suite (including the girl who I mainly had the issue with). This means that there is a chance nobody would be assigned to my double, and I would have a larger room to myself. An opportunity came up, however, to live in a suite with a guaranteed single with one of my best friends. If I move out, that puts my suitemates into an even worse situation, with the possibility of having 3 new people living with them. I'm uncomfortable around them because of the way they treated me, and their lack of remorse, but I don't want to throw gasoline on the fire when it's just starting to die down. Additionally, I'm not sure if taking the risk of a random roommate would be worth it (my roommate and I picked each other).

26592,Non-Romantic,2hgqwx,"I need some help. I've been working at a large multi-national corporation for the last decade or so. It's my dream job, and i've been working my way up the last few years to become one of the top people in the entire company. 

I've even been Employee of the Month for a few months running back in 2011. Since then, a few others have been ahead of me, but i'm still consistently in the top 20 people there.


Then there's Aaron. 


He's been with the corporation a while as well, but he's not as much the company man I've been (he left when his contract ran out, then came back again a few years later).

But for the most part, he's been a solid and smart worker who always did a good job.



There's even a fast-track programme in the company designed to help workers become Employee of the Month material within a year. I was on the programme before and it did me great. Last year, Aaron was selected, and it seemed like he was going places.



Then it seemed to go downhill for him.

I think it all started last October, when he publicly insulted one of the top employees. It didn't do him any good, and made him look really bad.


After that, he started phoning his work in. He didn't do his job as great as he used to, and then he started coming to work in more casual clothes. He was prone to occasional outbursts about the corporation too. He'd have left, but he has an ironclad contract for another year. It was like he was giving up on things.


Then the impressions started. 


At first it was funny - he'd impersonate some celebrities voices and keep everyone entertained. On one occasion, he pretended to be the CEO, which we all got a laugh out of.


It was harmless.


Then out of nowhere, he started impersonating me. I laughed it off at first - he kept doing different impersonations all the time. I figured he'd copy me for a day, then move on to someone else.


But it didn't stop.


He's started dressing like me, acting like me. Even making the same movements i do, but behind my back. It's a bit unsettling.


I'm currently trying to get a promotion at work, but i feel that if Aaron keeps copying me like this all the time, it'll make me look foolish, and bring me down with him. I don't know what to do!

26635,Non-Romantic,35leeh,"To give some background details, my sister Liz turned 15 about six months ago and has worked part-time for over a year at the same place. She is very beautiful, sociable and definitely does not look her age. She’s frequently mistaken for being around 18-20. 


Over the past 6-9 months Liz has changed a lot, which in my opinion is somewhat understandable at this age. She has been caught drinking a few times this year, as well as being caught with marijuana in her bedroom on one occasion. This resulted in a grounding and a discussion about the effects of the drug on brain development. She was also caught sneaking out once. So, she has been caught doing what I view as a few fairly normal rebellious teenage activities. She has always maintained good grades and school attendance during this time and has high aspirations for her future. In my view some boundary pushing is to be expected at her age. I strongly believe that she is too young to be doing these things but I also know how difficult it is to forbid them. 


My mum and I began to suspect that she was dating someone when she began to buy more pretty underwear. We all live together and I do most of the washing so I was the first to notice. It started off as a few lacy items and then it got ridiculous with the amount of lingerie she owns. I found stockings and a corset in her room when I was putting away clothes (I snooped). She owns more than me (in my 20s) and items that just seem way too sexualised for her age. I started to think she was dating someone older around this point as I don’t think she would be going to such extremes (spending good chunks of her pay on lingerie) if the guy was her age. I got the impression that she was really trying to impress someone sexually. This started to concern me and I spoke to her about it. She denied everything but I was unconvinced.


Around this same time Liz also began working more shifts and also getting dropped home after work often by co-workers. She also started putting more effort into her appearance at work. This made my mother &amp; I suspicious that she was dating someone older from work but we had no proof. I wasn’t totally sure that she was having sex but I gave her a few talks about pregnancy, STI’s and stressed the importance of condom use if she was going to have sex. I also gave her my opinion that sex should be something you do with someone you trust and have mutual respect with. 


The other day was when the truth all came out. She left her phone on the table unlocked and I picked it up and snooped. I wasn’t going to but I am glad I did. I opened her messages and the last one was to an older male co-worker, Alex. He is also my friend’s older brother and I grew up with him and his sister. He turned 24 2 months ago. I knew she had a crush on him and I had actually briefly suspected that he may have been the guy she was seeing. I put this from my mind almost the instant that it occurred to me, as it seemed crazy. The night that she snuck out was his birthday, which is what raised my suspicions in the first place.


The message made it clear that they were having sex. I was shocked and quickly put the phone down so she didn’t know I had seen it, while I processed the information. A little later, when my sister, mum and I were alone I looked at her and told her I knew what was going on, and who she was seeing, and that she needed to tell the truth now. The situation is a bit of a blur but she admitted very reluctantly that she had been having sex with him for a couple of months, although I suspect longer. We tried to be as sympathetic as possible, while impressing upon her the seriousness of the situation. She was very distressed by us confronting her. She says it has been going on for a couple of months, but we expect longer.


Alex has a history of dating girls in the 5-7 years younger age bracket, and recently got out of a 2-3 year relationship with a girl who is 17 now. This is one of the things that really disgusts and alarms me. To me an older man consistently being interested in younger girls is a red flag. 


My sister told us that they are not even in a ‘relationship.’ I do feel that she has been taken advantage of. My mum and I spoke to her about how this is illegal, and tried to gently explain that there is a power imbalance going on because of the big age gap. She disagreed profusely, and I told her that she will probably view this differently in a few years. We explained that we could go to the police over this matter and she begged us not to. 


I am sad because I know that she is going to be deeply hurt by this. I wanted my sister to have a positive first sexual experience and I don’t know how to proceed. I know it was consensual, but legally a 15 year old can’t consent to sex with an adult. I am angry at Alex and largely blame him for this situation, although I know that my sister is not totally innocent. I understand him being attracted to my sister, but he never should have acted on it. In my view it was his responsibility as the adult to put a stop to it. If we pursue matters legally his whole life could be ruined &amp; he would be labelled a sex offender. However I do not think that we will take this path, mostly because of the stress it will cause my sister.


Alex’s sister Claire, my childhood friend, has messaged me several times but I haven’t responded as I am still figuring out what to do. I am unsure of whether I should tell her about this, or even speak to him directly. I also fear that my friend won’t accept the severity of this out of loyalty to her brother.


My main concern is my sister. I am unsure of how to be there for her right now. I don’t want to make things harder for Liz but I still don’t want Alex to think that his behaviour is acceptable. She is still working at the same place as him, which must be horrible for her. Ultimately I am just confused and would like some advice from people who aren’t close to the situation. Am I putting too much blame on him? I don’t want Alex to walk away from this without any consequences, but I am unsure what those should be. How can I support my sister?

Took me 3 months, a lot of pain and a lot of thinking to get over her.

I first tried to stay close to her and see her a lot immediately after the breakup, suffered a lot as she was flakey, wanting some cuddles but saying it was wrong between friends, etc.

Went full no contact for two months after we almost had sex (we were both wanting but she panicked and I felt like I was hurting her, bad experience), it was hard but I pulled through.

She contacted me immediately after the classes started back (we go to the same college), and we ended up seeing each other as friends.

I don't see her as my gf/ex anymore, but still as someone incredibly important in my life, as she really is a great friend.

Right now, we see each other for two hours a week tops, when she feels like she wants to eat with me, and barely talk as she doesn't like texting.

When I say barely talk, I mean it. If I don't text her, she never texts me. And if I do, she barely answers.

I feel like she doesn't even try. She keeps telling me and other people that I'm her best friend, and does a few nice things like making me meet her friends. But she refuses to spend some time with me aside from that.

Unfortunately right now I only have a few hundred dollars saved up for the move.

But my brother has a few grand saved up, and he said as soon as I find a job in the state where we decided to move to, he will send me the money for the first month's worth of rent, if he can't be there yet (he has to stay in the military until mid July). However I feel really guilty doing this.

I still have two months that I could find a job where I live (it would be much more difficult though, I live in a very popular college town where it's incredibly difficult to find a job) and save up more money, and hopefully not have to use his saved money to move in. I guess the truth is that I feel guilty because, if I take the trip and get a job up there, I'll be needing an apartment up there ASAP, which would mean of course that I have to use (a lot) of his money.

I would feel bad if he gave me half of the month's rent for the next two months and he wasn't even staying there, but since he offered I'm not sure if I am supposed to pay him back (for his portion, for the deposit I will pay him back for sure.)

My other Aunt drove across the state to pick Joy up and bring her back so she could spend Christmas with her sisters, brother, and mother, and when I showed up to our yearly family Christmas Eve, I found Joy with a drink in her hand. My mother tells me that it's the only way that Joy can be 'normal', but enabling an alcoholic is clearly not a solution. 


Joy has been in assisted living facilities before, but been kicked out multiple times for not following the rules.

It is my firm belief that her best chance of survival is to have her involuntarily committed. I don't know if I can even do this as her nephew, how to begin this process, and how long they can keep her there if she protests. Am I overstepping my bounds?

* I was very close to a guy and girl for the past 4 years. Eventually about 2 years ago they started dating.
* Over this past summer I went through a very difficult time with a life long illness I have and went into very serious depression. I told them about this and they were supportive of it at first. However it got out of hand. I became very negative, insecure, and questioning of everything. This of course led to fights.
* About 2 months ago the girl said she needed a break from me, but that we could still talk. Well after a week of not hearing from her, I reached out to her and got no response. Because of this I got mad and called her a liar I think. During this time the BF who is also my best friend was trying to give me advice on what to do. After I reached out to her and no response I gave up talking to both however. During this time I had also been in therapy for a month due to my depression.
* Fast forward to last Monday and I reached out to both of them. I first called the guy as he was the last to actually talk to me and there was very little hard feelings there. He didn't answer me. She did however.
* She immedicatly answered the phone (she even said she didn't hesitate to answer) and told me she had been thinking about me, cried about me, and missed me. We caught up for a bit and I told her how I was in a better place after months of therapy. We both apologized and she said she wanted to be friends again, but did enjoy the space as we didn't fight, but missed me. She said she wanted to take it slow because we were still both probably upset. She also said she never intended this break to last this long, but when I called her a liar she never wanted to talk to me again, but here she is now  and she wanted to reach out on Thanksgiving, but didn't but felt she would have at some point soon.
* When I asked why the BF didn't answer she said he didn't even tell her I called. She also said whenever she would say do you miss X? he would say Yes, but then I remember the things he said to me. Which is weird because I never said anything bad to him...

So I guess what do you guys make of this situation. I was thinking about calling her next week maybe Wednesday and asking her for lunch next Friday or Saturday. Is this a bad move?

26656,Non-Romantic,2iq7i2,"After graduating college, about five years ago, I moved back home. In doing so I resumed the responsibility of having to help care for my two brothers. They are 19 months apart from each other, whereas I am a decade older, so I feel like I've always shared the responsibility in taking care of them with my parents.  

My brother has always had issues with going to school.  He is extremely smart and does incredibly well on all standardized tests, typically ranking in the 98th(ish) percentile.  He can go days of sleeping through class yet still ace all of the teachers tests. When he was in elementary school my parents found out he has epilepsy. Specifically, frontal lobe seizures which are supposed to affect your mood and behavior. He was placed on a bunch of different medications to control the epilepsy along with its other effects. 
Through all of this he would still exhibit mood and behavior issues.  He would abuse his younger brother, hit us, talk back, and display other violent actions.  In doing so, he would occasionally get spanked, yelled at, or hit with a belt.  My step father has anger issues of his own, not overboard to the point of abuse, but enough to where my mom or I would step in to save him from a beating. That's not to say we didn't sometimes punish him as well. I know how bad this sounds, but you don't know this kid.

My mom has taken him to therapists.  He has seen at least three now. The most recent was a younger male that he refused to talk to.  My mom said that he would go in and just shut down. He would say absolutely nothing for an hour.  
He was out of regular schooling for 2 years, where he was supposed to be working through virtual schooling.  It was during these 2 years that he completed the 8th grade, and I say he took the time off to play video games. 

He barely made it into the 9th grade this year.  My mom had to basically beg the virtual school teachers to extend his due dates and allow him to turn in year old work so that he could go to high school. Since the school year began he is exhibiting his old habits.  He refuses to wake up in the morning and misses the bus everyday.  When he's supposed to be doing his homework on the computer, he is playing video games.  If I try to talk to him, he tells me to shut up.  Says he doesn't like me, and doesn't want to talk to me. 

He's no longer on the medications, and has been off of them for almost 2 years now.  He tells my mom that we drugged him and abused him all through his childhood and blames all of his current problems about waking up for school on her.  If he doesn't do his homework, it's her fault. If he doesn't wake up for school, its her fault.  She just bought him a brand new Galaxy phone, but he refuses to set an alarm clock on it.  She'll go in to wake him up for school in the morning and he flat-out refuses to get out of bed and get in the shower.  If you try to pull him out of bed, he punches you. My step-dad has been out of the state for work, so he hasn't been around much to help with discipline lately.  

It kills me to see him like this.  I know he must feel so alone and angry, but he would never tell us so.  He has absolutely no respect for anyone and thinks that everything should just be handed to him.  My mom buys him new things, thinking that will make him more happy or like her more, but it doesn't change his behavior for more than a day.  Since we really have no where to turn, we have discussed sending him to a local reform school, we're just not sure if he would turn out worse than he is now.  We have been told that most kids that go to this place are drug dealers, or gang members, which he is nowhere near as bad.  Does anyone have any experience with any of this? Thanks for your thoughts, guys.

TL;DR:  My brother with behavior and medical issues continues to act out, I want to know if reform school is the answer.

26686,Non-Romantic,2xt1ak,"I believe that my sister has severe social anxiety. She has never dated, or had any friends as an adult. She does have a college degree and she works in an administrative role in a doctor's office. Her anxiety, however, prevents her from pursuing any sort of activities outside of work. She can't go into a coffee shop by herself, or go to a movie by herself. She relies on my parents to take her out.


My parents have tried to construct a narrative of capability around her, most likely in the hope that she would build on it. Instead, she's just gotten MORE dependent. My mom has had 2 strokes and an knee replacement and is also partially blind, while my dad has stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. They are really not in a situation where they can be caretakers. I am worried sick about how my sister's dependency affects their health.


Still, caretaking is what my sister expects. My parents arranged the purchase of a 2200-sq-ft house for her, putting down $60,000 so she could afford the mortgage. Now they are responsible for the maintenance and repairs on a second house in addition to their own. My sister adopted a dog after my parents got her the house; now my parents are also responsible for taking the dog on daily walks and providing it veterinary care. My dad still changes the oil in my sister's car and is responsible for repairs and car maintenance as well. Every 4-5 years or so they will give their old car to my sister so she has a newer one to drive. When it snows, they'll go over and shovel her driveway.


(I arranged snow removal for both driveways, but my sister was furious because the snow removal company would do their commercial accounts first. She called my parents instead of me and insisted that the professional snow removal be stopped, so they stopped it.)


My parents also feed into my sister's anxieties. For example, the cable company was installing new cable lines in my sister's neighborhood and they asked her to leave her back gate open. My sister was petrified that kids would come into her yard if she left the gate open, so she asked my dad to spend a day over at her house to let the cable company through the locked gate. So he did.


I'm 40, and watching my parents' health deteriorate while my sister grows even more dependent on them is heartbreaking. Also, I feel like my sister has been shielded from learning crucial adult living skills. I will not be able to step in and assume the caretaking position when my parents are no longer able to fulfill it. 


What should I do? The whole thing makes me SO sad. I also feel like my kids (ages 5 and 10) are missing out on time with their grandparents because my parents are so busy taking care of my sister.



TL;DR; My parents are in their 70s. My 37-year-old sister has severe social anxiety and she is dependent on my parents as caretakers. I worry about my parents' health. How can I encourage my sister to be more independent? How can I encourage my parents to take a step back? How can I communicate to everyone that I will never take over the caretaking position and my sister needs to learn adult living skills?

I work in the restaurant industry as a server and I recently, about a month ago, transferred to a new restaurant. The majority of people there are very chill and friendly and have already tried to invite me out to go do some group activities, which I appreciate being the new girl and all. However, there is one co-worker who has crossed my boundaries. He has smacked me on the ass and tried to play it off like it was an accident but I could tell from his tone it definitely wasn't. Also while I was bending down to clean something at the end of the night, came and straddled my head, like tea-bagging me, playfully.

I informed him that he had crossed wayyy too many lines with me and he said he didn't mean to upset me and it was all a joke and he apologized. Well I told him thank you for the apology but I still went to speak to management because he now makes me very uncomfortable. I also spoke to management because afterwards as I was finishing up all of my closing duties he continued to talk to me in inappropriate ways, at least in my eyes. He has said a few other inappropriate things before but I honestly thought they were in jest. I mean I've had other co-workers actively ask me out but when I said no, I have a bf, they respected that and backed off. 

My manager said to me that they would speak to him and if he did anything else, he would be fired and I am sure they said something similar to him. I work with this co-worker today and I am nervous to. I don't want to be known as a snitch or tattle-tell. I also have high anxiety towards any type of confrontation. Like get shaky, get sweaty palms, start stuttering and get an increased heart rate type anxiety. 

My question for all you lovely people is, how do I continue to work alongside him? Would it be best to ignore him and keep my distance and hope he just leaves me alone?

And **Tl;Dr**: Brother-in-law refuses grandchildren when parents won't give him money. This leaves my parents horribly depressed. What can I do?

----------------------------------------------------


This has been happening since my sister married him (6 years-ish). He's manipulative, selfish, and abusive. He holds his children against my parents to get money from them.

So here's the most recent story. My sister asked parents for gas money. The following morning, she suddenly needs even more gas money. My dad was furious--how can one person use so much gas in one day? So he said Sure, but this time I'm going with you to get it. 

They both get in the car, and brother-in-law is there. According to my dad, BiL got so pissed off that he jumped out of the car on the drive to the gas station. Turns out sister didn't actually need gas, but BiL just wanted drug money. Who would'a thunk it?

During this time BiL is running back to our house, where my mom and I had been babysitting their 3 children for the past two days. He yells at us, says he's cutting us off forever, you won't see my kids again! He forcefully grabs the kids and waits outside for their mom.

The reason I'm posting this is because of the aftermath. The kids are my parents' absolute world. They are physically disabled and have severe depression, so spending a day at the pool with the kids means everything to them. When my BiL pulls this crap, then they become horribly depressed and empty shells of themselves. They argue and lock themselves in their rooms all day. I can't stand seeing them like this.

I know my family is really screwed-up, but it's the only one I have, y'know? Every time this happens, my parents vow to never give them money again, yet every time they end up doing it again, for the kids. And so the cycle continues. I just wish there were something I could do or say to convince them to truly stop for good. Because if it truly meant they'd never see the kids again, then it wouldn't be worth it in their eyes.

I finished my Law Degree last year and my mother and step-mum don't get on, my mum is over-emotional and my step mum is a sly, evil woman who has made her lifes work to deal out sly inappropriate comments.


I've generally ignored it for my childhood but I was always worried about my graduation, my brother is the best and for the weekend of my graduation he took my mum away and I took my step mum and dad so they didn't get much contact in.


I warned them both before that this is really important to me and I was generally concerned for years which they knew about. It ended up going to shit when my mum became over emotional and my step-mum was a bitch and my dad just sat there.


I was fairly upset over the whole ordeal and felt the two turned it into their night. She called a few weeks after semi-apologising to me but seemed like Dad had forced her.

2) There is 90% chance I'll pick this place and move to the same city as them, I aim to structure it so I have to rely on them as little as possible (maybe live with them for a week or two). I don't want her at my admission, I want to enjoy the moment.

26735,Non-Romantic,2ylaqu,"I find myself in a very difficult position as my mother's decisions are ruining my future. It's a long story. I went to college when I was 16 (I turned 17 during the first semester). Part of it was because I skipped some grades and also because I was so desperate to leave home through one way or another. Because of my family's income, I barely received any financial aid or scholarships despite my academic merit. As a result, we used a trust fund from my grandmother to pay for my first two semesters at college. I've always had mental health problems from depression to eating disorders but I didn't think they'd manifest themselves even more when I went off to college. At the end of the first semester, I had academic probation and at the end of the second semester I was academically suspended for a semester at the recommendation of both my major's dean, academic advisor, and my mental health counselor who suggested I needed a mental health break. By the time second semester was over, my mental health was horrible- I couldn't get out of bed and barely made it through the semester as well as having over 500 bucks in meal plan money because my self image had gotten so bad I never ate anything.


Of course my parents were angry and upset at me. They don't understand mental illness or mental health- they think I chose to be depressed, that I cut myself in high school for attention and  because I want to kill my family (my mom's words), and that despite the drastic the weight I loss from an eating disorder (I went from a size 10 to a size 4/6) is from good dieting. Things were so horrible at home after I left that I left home for about 3-4 months to go stay with my aunt in Tennessee.


When I got back home things had changed somewhat. My dad forgave me for messing up and only wanted me to do better in my life. My mother was still angry at me and lashed out me randomly, and still does now. When the time came to register for classes and pay for school for the spring 2015 semester, initially I had just assumed that we would use my grandma's trust fund money again and cover part if it with our own money. Tuition was incredibly high because I had lost what little scholarships I had as well as I had lost my financial aid because of my grades. My vindictive mother refused to allow my grandmother to help pay my schooling and refused to pay anything herself. I couldn't get a private student loan because both my parents don't have good credit history and my grandmother is too old to be a cosigner. Although my grandmother was going to be my cosigner originally if we had found a loan to get approved for, my aunt manipulated her into refusing to cosign by lying about the consequences of cosigning a loan and telling her that she'll have a lot of financial hardship (I think it's because my aunt is  concerned about what she and her children inherit after my grandmother passes away- my grandma owns a lot of land, stocks, valuable first edition books and antiques, etc that she's willed away to certain people but she won't say to whom). Because I had no way of paying for that semester, I had to drop out for yet another semester in school.


After about a month of really rough depression, I picked myself up and got a job and I'm currently in the process of getting another one. I work long 12 hour days and save every penny for school. But I'm taking advantage of my newfound income and have started to pay for a lot of my own health things such as new glasses/contacts, appointments with various doctors regarding some health things, etc which I couldn't have done before because my mother rarely took us to the doctor or dentist even though our insurance covers most of it, and my dad works all the time so a lot of things were ultimately up to her. I also have to save up money for a car, since we only have one car in the family now that my mom's car needs to be repaired and she doesn't want to take it to get work done on it and I don't want to burn out my dad's new car by putting so many daily miles on it. I opened a banking account to put all of my work money in yesterday with the intent that only I would know the amount of money I have. When my mom found out, she became upset that I wouldn't have her name on my account as well, so I changed it to have her name on it. When I told her, she had mentioned in passing that my grandma called her, wanting to talk to me and offer to match the amount of money I made to a certain amount to help me pay for school. I had been counting on and needed some financial help from my grandma for college, which she had promised after seeing me disappointed about not going to school this semester. When I got angry at her and told her that without my grandma's help I wouldn't be able to pay for college at all and would have to drop out, she simply shrugged, rolled her eyes, and said oh well and left the room. I'm frustrated- her selfish decisions are keeping me out of school. Even with overtime and working every day, I can't make enough money to cover a semester by the time school starts for the fall semester and even though my mom knows that, she doesn't give a damn. I feel stuck and I have no clue what to do- my grandma won't give me any financial help without both my parent's approval, my mom won't pay for anything herself, and my tuition is so much that even though my dad wishes he could, he can't pay it on his own and it's unfair to ask him to do so. I can't transfer schools because my grades are bad so they won't send off my transcript until my gpa gets above a certain amount and even then I don't know if any schools will accept me.

In about 4 hours I'm going to confront my dad with his bills and bad financial habits which has affected me and my mother. For about 5 years he is paying off bills and me and my mother are also paying as much as we can miss to help him. But I'm sick and tired of him hiding bills, being very secretive and just straight up lying. The last drop was today when I found a last warning from our energy company. If he doesn't pay a sum of a couple hundred euros bij Thursday then our gas and electricity is going to be cut of. This pissed me of because he was telling us for a couple of months that everything was going good and the end was in sight. I decided to go in his room and found a large pile of opened and unopened bills. 

I'm thinking about confronting him tonight, in the presence of my mother while showing the pile of bills and give him 3 choices. 

1. He keeps going with this and I, and hopefully also my mother, will leave him asap. Burning all the the ships/bridges that has something to do with him. 

2. He seeks professional help. I already know 2 company who I know are good in what they do and they can help him. They can also mediate with the company's which my dad has his debts with. 

3. Enroll in an government regulated payroll type of programme. He and his money will be monitored and regulated by a professional and will be set on a minimum wage and the rest of his wage wil be used to pay of his bills. After 5 years any remaining bills wil be forgiven and he will be given full control of his financials agian. 

Is this a good idea or not? I can't live like this any longer because thanks to this I too am forming debts and have zero savings. Any help would be appreciated.

UPDATE:
Talked with my dad and my mother. At first he was very defensive (as expected) and tried to sush the discussion. But after me and my mom kept asking for answers he was responsive. He gave us an insight in his finance and made a promise that the remaining debt would be paid of in January. If not, he would seek professional help.

His response is, I don't even want to talk to you, because you're mean! You're just mean! Like, in front of customers, he does this.

I'm not... gonna do this elementary school stuff. Please just clock out and go.
You're elementary!

So, I just told him to clock out and go. Which he eventually did, after following me around for a few minutes while I made the food order. (???)



He also left his workspace a mess, which added about 2 hours to my own work load. 

Like... I have no idea how to respond to this, or even dissect it. No one's ever behaved like this to me. Especially not in a work setting. So, I've just been ignoring it? I don't know!

---

This isn't the first problem I've had with ₧. It's just the most recent, and most confusing. 



Another incident, just to illustrate what I'm dealing with, happened during some deliveries. We had a call to deliver something at Point A, which I informed ₧ about while he was making the return trip from another delivery. When he stopped by the front desk to pick up the delivery, I added on a delivery at Point B, which was in between Point A and our location. 



So, I told him, Bring this item to A. Bring this item to B. And then come back.
I have to make two trips.

You don't. Go to A. On the way back from A, stop by B. And then come back.

I have to make two trips! This is ridiculous, this doesn't make sense. I have to make two trips!

At which point I just handed him the items and told him to do it whatever way he wanted.

Why would you... make your job... harder??? Especially if you're not being paid very well?

Later on, he informed me that he wouldn't be doing his cleanup in the kitchen (a recurring problem). I told him that wasn't acceptable, because everyone else was doing double their workload and filling in for absences. He reacted like I was yelling at him, hands up and backing away from me. I wasn't gonna continue that interaction because it was just dumb. Went back to work, and so did he. So, a win?



---



Some (more accurately: all) coworkers have approached me and told me that ₧ has been spreading some rumors about me having anger issues, and serious problems. I told management about it, just so they know about the situation. No one else I work with has taken it seriously, and it's even become sort of a joke. So, maybe his more recent behavior is from... some kind of inadequacy thing? Like, the back-firing of his rumor spreading makes him feel powerless, so he lashes out?

---

₧ constantly asks me for help with operating our POS system, despite having worked here longer than I have. It makes me wonder whether or not he's just behaving in this way to get me to take on more of his duties and allow him more slack.

The newest member of our team says ₧ constantly bragged about how easy all the work here was (true) and his proficiency at everything. So is this like, an image thing? Am I stepping on a fragile ego?

---

Ultimately... I'm just gonna keep ignoring this behavior. Unless anyone knows how else to deal with this? I'm really, really not sure what the thought process behind this stuff is.

I'm also hispanic and a lesbian (very out). So... I'm not sure if he's just not happy with being spoon-fed directions by a person like me, or... what? Like, it's just so off the wall I don't know where it's coming from. I'm not trying to pull the race card (or gay card?), I just literally can't understand this behavior.

I should also say, this is a min wage job. So I'm not like, expecting pristine work here. I know it sucks, and I get it. But, if he dodges his work, then I have to do it. And, I'm not interested in doing two people's work for the amount of money I'm being paid.

This genre of porn appeared frequently and I noticed he'd search up specific terms like brother sister sex on porn streaming sites.

26816,Non-Romantic,27uxr6,"(using a throwaway because the friend in question knows my username)

I had a friend (we will call him M) who I used to be really, really close with. We were best friends for several years, and worked at the same office (we still do). We confided a lot in each other, and helped each other through some really difficult times. He told me a lot of things that he would never tell anyone else, and I told him a lot of things too. We bonded a lot over the crappiness of our workplace and some of our particularly awful coworkers and supervisors, and stuck up for each other during a lot of really unfair treatment in our office. We ended up having and making a lot of mutual friends, who we remain friends with to this day. 

My particular boss (we don't have the same immediate supervisor) is famous for his favoritism toward one specific employee and treats his other employees (including myself) very poorly. His one favorite employee, who I will call J, took a particular disliking to me, and told all of the other employees that he hated having to train someone and that training me was a burden, especially because he thought I was dumb. My boss liked me quite a bit until J started trash-talking me to him and to all the other supervisors and employees. After this, my boss came to me and said J said you aren't doing well, and so I've decided you have no future in [this career]. I confronted J, and he admitted he had lied to everyone, and agreed to tell our boss that I was doing the job well (which was the truth). M and I had just become friends at this point, and I spent a lot of time venting about how shitty the situation was and how awful J had been. M was in a similar situation - one of his co-workers made his life hell sometimes, and so he'd vent to me about that. We also had a really, really sexist supervisor who got away with the worst possible treatment of female employees. I could go on and on - we work in a really weird workplace. Co-workers have come and gone, but there have been a lot of really awesome ones in the past year or so, and M and I have befriended them and we've all grown really close. 

Enter a few months ago. J gets a HUGE promotion, and all of the sudden, my friend M stops talking to me completely. We used to get lunch and coffee every day, and go to bars and stuff on the weekend with some of our other friends, and text and gchat a lot - all of this stops completely with no warning. I try confronting M about it, and he makes all kinds of excuses, saying he's too busy, etc. I ask a mutual friend of ours (who has known M twice as long as I have) if he knows what is going on, and he tells me that M has a reputation of getting sick of people and moving from friend to friend, and then treating his old friends like shit and gossiping about them behind their back. I think to myself oh no, M would never do that to me, we were really, really close. Another friend tells me that M told him that since J got a promotion, M really wanted to be friends with him, and I wasn't popular with J so M didn't want to be seen with me anymore. 

At this point I'm thinking what the actual fuck, and after trying for months to get M to be honest with me and actually give me a reason that he completely cut me out of his life, I give up. I tried everything. If he doesn't want me in his life, then I just have to give up on our friendship, no matter how close we were. 

Over the past few weeks, I've heard from co-workers that M has been telling *everyone* (including **my boss**) all of the things I confided in him. Literally, all of the things. From problems I had with my boyfriend, to a miscarriage I had a couple years ago, to the name of the therapist I'm seeing and all of the medications I'm on, to an awful problem I had with my family over christmas time. 

I'm so horrified. I can't believe that a friend who was close with me would ever do this. My whole workplace is abuzz with all of my most personal information. I feel horrible going into work, and I hate going to work knowing that he's gossiping about my most personal information behind my back. I can't believe it. I have no idea what to do. What blows my mind most is that *he shared information with me that was just as personal* - why on earth would you break that kind of trust? All so that you can be in with J? 

Please give me some advice. This situation is so horrible, and I have no idea what to do. I can't quit my job. I'm afraid I am going to lose all of my other friends because of this. Everyone at work - even my boss - knows all of my personal secrets. I can't live like this.

26825,Non-Romantic,1n6gtj,"Let me preface this by acknowledging that I’m being a jerk here. I just don’t know how to navigate through this and/or make myself not feel this way.


There are two girls (23F and 28F) that I became friends with when we all worked together about 3 years ago. One of them, I’ll call her K, quit the job but we still kept in touch. The other, M, still works here, and I am now her boss (since I was promoted several times throughout the past two years). Though we all float around the same social circle, these two girls are really more connected with me than anyone else that we hang out with. 


The problem is that I don’t really enjoy spending time with them. We don’t have a whole lot in common outside of the job that we all worked. I’m working full time and going to school full time, so lately I’ve been feeling really selective about who I spend my limited free time with. And something about our personalities just clashes, and most of the time I wind up feeling really irritable and pissy. If we’re drinking, this can get blown into straight up anger (on my part). K can just be very “mothering” and I’m pretty independent, so I don’t like feeling babied. She’s SUPER nice though, which just makes everything worse, because I feel like I’m being an asshole by not liking her. And things with M are weird because she’s been causing problems at work and it’s awkward for me to balance my authority with our social relationship outside of work. She constantly victimizes herself and doesn’t do anything to change the things that she’s complaining about. We’re also both stubborn, and bicker about stupid stuff all the time because each one of us thinks we’re right. 


But they consider me to be one of their closest friends, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. How do you pull away from people that aren’t really doing anything but being themselves? Especially when they’re relatively immersed in your group of friends? I also want to note that there are several other friends of ours who have similar irritations with them (so I’m not totally crazy here) but since I’m sort of the first link, they don’t have to deal with it as much.


What’s also causing a problem here is that my boyfriend of 5 years (so he’s met all the same people as me and we’re in the same social circle) doesn’t have any sort of problem with them. And he gets really bothered when I become upset, and says that I’m being negative and rude. So it’s a vicious cycle of me not really liking these girls, but hanging out with them anyways, getting irritated, and then fighting with my boyfriend because he thinks I’m being mean-spirited. 

I have always thought of myself as loving, kindhearted, and friendly. This irritating, angry person that keeps surfacing is unfamiliar to me, and I don't know how to stop it. 


Is there a way for me to just stop letting them bother me? Can I work at being a better person? Or is it fair for me to not want to hang out with them? If that’s the case, then how does one dissolve a friendship? Just ignore them?

26850,Non-Romantic,271urv,"First and foremost, the subject matter of our fallout is that I had sex with his g/f at the time. It was a fucked up situation, something I've learned a lot from and would do differently if given the chance. 

I guess it all started when I was 19 and driving home from a house party with my g/f at the time. It was after 2am, and as we were driving we passed my best friend's g/f walking on the side of the road. I pulled over and asked her if she needed a ride, and she's like, No, I'm walking to meet with my sister, I'll be fine. My g/f wouldn't accept that answer and was insistent that she let us give her a ride, so we drive her to a coffee shop and she asks that we not mention any of this to my best friend and that she'll be ok, we can leave. My g/f was pretty adamant about making sure she was safe so we waited around until a guy on a BMX bike rides up and  she gets on his back pegs and they ride off without saying a word. 

Of course the first thing I do is call my best friend. He thought I was playing a prank and hung up. I call him back, telling him this isn't a prank. He's in denial, tells me off, and doesn't want to hear it. Turns out, I'm not the only one who had told him of similar tales. His cousins had seen her out with another guy at a house party, as had other friends, and my best friend was still in denial. 

Fast forward 2 years, they're still together, we're now 21 and I had just moved back to town and was living in their apartment. My best friend had to go out of town for work for about 2 weeks, and I continued to sleep on the couch. Well, one day I come back after running errands and his g/f is walking around the house in booty shorts and a sports bra. I'm like whateves, trying to be a gentleman and not paying much attention to her. Then she comes over and sits on the couch next to me and asks for a back rub. Before I know it, she's putting my hands places they definitely don't belong.

I tell her no, that this is wrong, and she replies, If you don't want to fuck me, then I'll just call somebody else and you'll have to listen to us fuck while you sleep on the couch. And knowing she had cheated on him in the past, I knew she wasn't bluffing.

So I caved. I betrayed my best friend. Her and I swore we'd never tell him, but he wasn't back for more than 2 days before I had to tell him. That happened over the phone, and before too long all my worldly possessions were left on his front porch waiting for me to pick them up (I didn't have a car or anywhere else to go. So a lot of stuff was missing when I finally was able to get over there...) 

We didn't speak for a year. He eventually broke up with her and moved to Southern California for work. We eventually talked things out and rebuilt our friendship, taking time visit each other a few times per year.

So here we are, 2014.  I recently got a job in Southern California, now we live 30 minutes apart, and we've been hanging out a lot, enjoying life. We went to a baseball game last night and went out for drinks afterwards. Somehow that ex of his came up, and we got to talking about some serious shit. He never knew I was manipulated by her and how much guilt I still feel so I told him. And he lost it. 

Everything seemed fine at first, we went our separate ways from the bar and I sent him a text telling him we should do it again sometime soon, it was a fun night! His response? 


I don't think that will ever happen again. You betrayed me. The one person I thought I could trust and you betrayed me. I recently borrowed some stuff from him and he went on to say, Just leave what you borrowed in my mailbox, I don't want to see or speak to you again. NO TRUST!!

In between us rebuilding our friendship and this falling out I've always been there for him, as he has always been there for me. On one St. Patrick's Day, I took a sucker punch and ended up brawling with some ex bf of the girl he had taken out to the bar. (My best friend has never been in a fight in his life, he didn't stand a chance against the other dude but I stuck up for him and fought this guy. Mean while him and his girl ran away...)

We've been there for each other over the years, he's like a brother to me, part of my family. I'm at a total loss of words and figured I'd just leave him be and give him his space but I seriously just feel so horrible for all this. I thought this issue was behind us, and I'm not the same person I was back then. Is there anything I can do to mend this friendship or is this it, the straw that broke the camel's back?

Let me begin with telling you about some issues I've run into in adulthood, and then highlight the patterns I've noticed with my mother raising my younger sister. Though some of these issues seem trivial, they've had an impact on me and could have easily been avoided. 


I did not know how to properly maintain finances. I was given what ever I wanted as a child, when ever I wanted it. My family has massive debts and as a young adult, I started on that path. I met my then girlfriend, now wife, and learned a lot. I have fixed this flaw with myself. 


My teeth are horrible. Very white and pretty as far as anyone else is concerned, but I've had a number of cavities. I was never taught to floss, how long to brush, to rinse, or why any of these tasks were important. Due to a lack in oral hygiene, I ended up having to pay out of pocket (sometimes what insurance didn't cover, sometimes the full fee) for dental care. One missing tooth + implant, 10-12 resin filling, and much education later, my teeth are doing okay and I'm now maintaining. 


I'm not sure what to say about my diet as a young adult. It was shit. Pure shit. Luckily I chose a bachelor's in Kinesiology and that requires a nutrition component. I have a great diet now. 


Until recently, I would say the past 4-5 years, I didn't know how to see value in things or take care of them properly. I'd break things, lose them, buy more, break them, lose them, buy more. It was a mentally and financially exhausting loop I'd found myself in. Perhaps responsibility was not my strong suit, but then again, I was never given a real opportunity to be responsible for something or taught the importance of responsibility. Of course, now I know. 

Looking back, my adulthood could have taken a shitty turn. Luckily, I moved and found myself surrounded by people that I could model myself after. I'm thankful for that. 

**My sister**

By now, I'm sure you can all understand the problems that I see unfolding. Having experienced the negatives of my mother's parenting style, I want to prevent my sister from being in the same position down the road. I'll just provide a short list of what I see happening in the home. 

-Sister's teeth are yellow/orange. Sister doesn't floss, and brushes 1x/day on weekends. 

-Sister breaks her new iPhone, and is given a new one. 

-Sister's diet consist's of white powdered doughnuts, potato chips, dr. pepper, ramen noodles, and chocolate. She's very thin, but she's also very 12. 

-Sister spends all day on iPad/iPhone/Mac, as does mother. I'm with them while typing this. No one has spoken for an hour.

-Sister isn't made to clean up after herself

-Mother waits on sister, bringing her food or drinks any time she asks

-Sister never watches anything educational


There's more, but I'll leave it at that. Of course, when I'm home I try to get my sister focused (for example with teeth brushing) but I know that when I leave she goes back to her old ways.

I was still living with my boyfriend when I asked my parents if it would be alright if he came to stay with us around Christmas time, and they said yes.

I was taken by surprise and said it would be, because the basement is not finished and some areas are showing bare insulation. The room my parents expect my boyfriend to sleep is primarily heated by space heaters. Neither is there a door or a bed, so he would be sleeping on a sofa. The TV room is open and he would have no privacy, especially as we have a dog and someone needs to go through that space to feed him in the mornings. It is my personal opinion that it is not a suitable place to put a guest for 2 weeks.

My mother has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day since she was 14 years old.  She is in her early 50's now.  She smoked during all 4 of her pregnancies.  She smoked in the house while all 4 of her kids were growing up.  I had multiple ear infections growing up which almost made me deaf in one ear, and my little sister had/has severe asthma, both of which can be attributed to my mothers smoking.  (Maybe not fully attributed to her smoking, but living in a household where a parent smokes increases the risk of both of those things).  Growing up I was made fun of a lot in school because my clothes always smelled like smoke. 
 

She has tried to quit a few times, but it never stuck and now she just says that she likes smoking and has no desire to quit and that everyone will just have to deal with it.  My mother does not care that she put her children's health at risk and that even now we all have an increased risk of cancer because of our exposure to second hand smoke growing up.  (Even if we avoid second hand smoke the rest of our lives, we still have an increased risk of cancer). 


When my older sister had her two kids a few years ago she made strict rules regarding my mother and her smoking.  My mother couldn't hold the babies after she smoked a cigarette.  She also had to change her clothes and wash her hands, etc.  This stuck for a little while but ultimately it regressed into her doing what she wanted.  My sister never stuck to her guns, and that's her decision and her kids, so I didn't want to get involved with that. 


Every time any of us (myself and my three siblings) have tried to get my mom to quit, she just turns it around to make it seem like we don't love her and 'its just so hard', 'she's an adult and can do what she wants', and blah blah, excuses.  Her smoking is one of the main reasons my parents ended up getting divorced.  And even now my dad (who is happily with someone else) is still trying to get my mom to quit smoking for her own health.


I haven't lived at 'home' for over 7 years.  I have been able to limit my exposure to the second hand smoke for the most part, only being exposed when I go to family gatherings.  But whenever I go visit her, its just awful.  She still smokes in her home, so whenever I go to her house my throat gets sore and I can barely breathe.  She says she airs the house out by leaving the windows/doors open, but she doesn't understand that it doesn't make the smoke go away.  I just don't want go to her house anymore.  


I was about to have a serious conversation with her about me not wanting to come to her home anymore, but I just found out she needs to have spinal surgery.  She is going to be on bed rest for like 6-8 weeks.  I am the only one of my siblings that is responsible enough to take care of her, which means going to her home, where she will be smoking. 


It just hurts me that she cares so little for not only her children's health, but her grandchildren's health, and her own health!  My mother cannot walk to the other end of her drive-way without being out of breath.  She literally cannot walk for 5 minutes without needing a break.  She is slightly overweight, but not obese.  She has always been very active and used to do gymnastics when I was growing up.  But she has not aged well at all.  She has the wrinkles of a 70 year old, is constantly sick with a hacking cough, and will most likely die from lung cancer, just like her mother.  If anything, I don't know how watching her own mother slowly suffocate to death in a hospital bed from lung cancer hasn't made her rethink smoking.


Help me reddit.  How do I maintain my relationship with my mother while not increasing my exposure to second hand smoke? Do I wait to talk to her after her surgery?  What should I say?  I have accepted that I do not have the power to make her quit smoking.  But I also don't want to watch her die.  I don't want to hold her hand while her eyes roll back in her head while she slowly suffocates like my grandmother.  And I will not willingly put myself at risk anymore.

To give you some backstory, I had my son when I was 16, and even though the man I'm marrying isn't my sons father, he's done more than his bio father ever has. We have a great little family and mostly everyone is happy for us.

So I have a bridal appointment on Friday at Kleinfelds (the show Say Yes To The Dress is filmed there) I've had this appointment since early May, and since then my Mother has been complaining about going. At first it was because she assumed she was going to end up being forced to buy an expensive gown, but I made it very clear to her that she's in no way obligated to buy anything. She is very generously helping us pay for some wedding costs, and I don't expect/want her to spend any more. I also found my dream wedding dress from an online only retailer (I'm having a very 'bohemian/free people inspired wedding and they don't have any dress like this in stores) for a very reasonable price. That is most likely the dress I will end up purchasing.

However. I really don't want my whole wedding dress experience to be me opening up a cardboard box. So I made the appointment at Kleinfelds, and made very clear to my Mother that we're just going there to see what different styles will look like on my body, and I really just wanted to have a fun day out in the city with my bridal party, my mother in law, and mom. Just to have a day where I was special and beautiful and to celebrate the fact that I'm getting married.

My Mother has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to go. and I asked her repeatedly, begged her, please even if you aren't happy, just pretend to be. Just for one day. and she agreed that she would.

but I've since overheard at least 10 separate conversations, and had her talk about it right in front of me, saying that she really doesn't want to go. That she thinks i'm being ridiculous and how she has to 'humor me'.

Today, one of my cousins (who's a bridesmaid) called her asking how we're getting there on friday and again my mother goes into this whole diatribe about how she doesn't want to go. and I snapped.

Me: Really? I asked you for one thing to just pretend to be happy for one day. That includes not complaining to everyone that you don't want to go!

Her: Oh one thing?! HOW ABOUT HOW I'M SIGNING THE CHECKS? THEN YOU LIKE ME! WHEN IM SIGNING CHECKS!

Then she called me an evil bitch in front of my 5 year old son.

I told her before repeatedly that I don't expect her to 'sign anymore checks'.

I just wanted to have a day to feel special and beautiful, and I don't understand why thats such a huge request.

Now I don't want to go at all anymore, the whole thing feels poisoned and if I do end up going, I just want to go alone, rather than have her sit there looking miserable the whole time, or having to explain to everyone why my own mother refused to come. I can't cancel the whole thing or go alone because so many people took off of work that day to be there.

Why can't she just pretend to be happy?

How do I explain in a way she'll understand, why I'm so upset?

What do I do?

I am using a throwaway since I am soo embarassed to talk to anyone about this.

Ok, back story: Me and my wife have been planning for a car for the last 2 years. My take home is about $400 and hers is $150 every month. We have diligently saved to about $2500, and she took a loan of about $1500 to bring the total to $4000. ( I am employed on contract basis so I cannot apply for a loan, I am repaying the loan though). 

The reason we need a car is because our baby came in December, and with the usual baby troubles, we have sometimes rush to the hospital at night. I am also attending night classes, which means that I usually get home at about 11pm. A car would have me getting home at about 9.30 pm.

My mom borrowed us cash about 4 months ago to complete building her house. Since I did not have any reason to doubt her, I gave her all our savings on condition that she returns the money as soon as we find a car to buy, instead of the money sitting idly in our account.

This month we found a car to buy, but my mom has refused to refund the loan we advanced her. She has become very arrogant and rude, and this is tearing us apart. My SO was against loaning the money to my mother in the first place, so now she is giving me a lot of pressure to get the money back, and my mom on the other side wont give me the cash.

She (lets call her Julie for simplicity's sake) met through a mutual friend this past december. We're in college and I saw she's in one of my classes. We quickly became close friends right after. We would always hang out with each other in our dorm rooms and just talk, have fun, etc. We both agreed that we'd stay friends, and thats what we both wanted anyway (just stupid rumors spreading amongst people caused this talk but nothing seemed to change in regards with our friendship). 




Fast forward after spring break, I noticed something was wrong, or so I thought. A week after spring break, she started to not text me so often and we weren't hanging out like we used too. After our class together, I'd text her to come to my room, as usual, but no response. Of course, my initial response is that I was wondering if she's ok, etc, and she would tell me yes. 



This week has been the same. Today,however, she told me she was dating a friend that we both know and she was with that person when she would have usually been chilling in my room. It caught me completely off guard, but I was happy for both of them. However, I'm worried that our friendship is changing because of her new relationship. Of course I know things won't be COMPLETELY THE SAME, but because she's my close friend and it's just weird that things just changed super quickly. I just want to be sure that our own close friendship won't be different. 



**tl;dr**: She's my best and closest friend and I found out that she's dating someone. I am extremely happy for her, but worried that our friendship will change drastically. I'm wondering even if that I did something wrong that made her go to that person and not me (I'm sure I could be overthinking). Should I even be worried? Should I say something?

26881,Non-Romantic,380mgh,"Hello all. I am 20F, 17 weeks pregnant, and am engaged to my 22M fiance. We have been together for four years. I have an Associate's degree and CDA (I am an infant/toddler teacher in a daycare and a nanny) and my fiance has a Bachelor's degree and has a decent office job that he enjoys.

For financial background information, my fiance has $7.5k in student loans he needs to start paying back in 6 months. We live in an apartment together, 3 hours away from my parents and 6 away from his. He makes about $1,000 every two weeks and I make about $800 every two weeks. We are frugal and do not spend much money on partying as neither of us are interested in that. In two weeks we maybe spend $250 each. Our rent is $769 a month including utilities. We share a reliable car. Between us, we have almost $10k in savings.

Now, this pregnancy was unplanned but we have decided to keep it. I was schedule to attend nursing school in the fall. My fiance is supposed to attend law school in two years. I am now not going to nursing school in the fall and my fiance is looking at putting off law school for awhile but he is disappointed about this.

Although he and I feel as though we are in a stable enough position to raise this baby, both of our parents seriously think otherwise. Both parents on both sides think that because we are not going to professional school right away that we will be financially incapable of supporting the baby long-term. Our parents have expressed they do not think having children is a good idea until we have paid off two cars, paid off all my fiance's student loan debt from future law school, and own our own house (paid off our mortgage.)

This mentality is very much bothering my fiance. Every time we're around his dad, my FIL will say to him something like well you can kiss law school goodbye now or think about your future, son. My parents told me we had higher hopes for you than to just be a young mom.

These instances make him feel like he will be a bad parents because we are irresponsibly bringing a baby into the world we cannot afford... even though when we crunch the numbers we are fine financially in my opinion! He was going to postpone law school for a few years anyway to save up the money to go. He doesn't even have to put off law school longer if he doesn't want to--the families I nanny for are willing to let me bring the baby to work. 

To be clear, no one is saying to give the baby up for adoption. My fiance does want to raise him/her, he is just nervous. The only reason our parents aren't pushing for adoption, I think, is because they see that I'm not unhappy about this.

I feel like everyone (my fiance included) is thinking of us as clueless teenagers who can't fathom the responsibility of taking care of a child...except we have lived on our own for three years, do not rely on them financially, and I've been an *infant nanny* for two years.

I really want someone else's opinion of the situation. Is it because we aren't continuing our education, is that why everyone is so uncertain? I feel like I am crazy/being immature or irresponsible for being excited and feeling like we are going to be okay because everyone's making it sound like it's a huge obstacle for our future and that we aren't thinking about what's best for the baby,

TL;DR Pregnant and feel like I can afford to raise the baby, but fiance and parents feel otherwise.","20 years old and pregnant--my parents (49M+F), my fiance (22M), my fiance's parents (42F/47M) think we cannot support our baby but I disagree",0.0,False,11.0,44.0,1433116060.0,/r/relationships/comments/380mgh/20_years_old_and_pregnantmy_parents_49mf_my/,NonRomantic

We've been close friends for about 3 years. We both suffer varying levels of depression/anxiety.

During one bad period of anxiety about 2 years ago she asked if I wanted to be more than friends. She asked this out of fear (for lack of a better word). She had a bf at the time, and she was worried that I wanted to be more than friends. This concern was brought on by a combination of her anxiety and I later found out one of her friends suggested I might have wanted to date her.

In truth, I was happy just being friends. I told her so, and that was the end of that. 

We stayed close since then, as our lives continued to change. We both moved houses a couple times. We provide each other with emotional support when we're going through a rough patch.

Okay, with that background, here's the reason for this post. Recently she asked me to travel with her to visit her Father who lives not too far away (her parents are separated). 

Am I wrong to be concerned that this might be a suggestion that she wants to be more than friends?

I've spoken to her Mom lots of times when she lived with her, but isn't that substantially different than traveling with her to see her Dad?

Maybe I'm totally overreacting and she is just being friendly. I guess I'm just a bit more worried than I would be for a couple of reasons. One, she's had a quite severe bout of anxiety lately, which she's just getting over. I was trying to support her and comfort her during this time. And two, during this same time frame her boyfriend left her. 

I don't want to be sending the wrong message, particularly when she's been having such a tough time lately. And I'm pretty bad and picking up on signals like if someone is interested in me, so I really don't know how to feel.

We had a small debate over something which we agreed to disagree on and I thought that the subject was dropped. Yet she and her boyfriend continued to argue about it, and then the argument just turned into an argument about each other. (You're being condescending, you always do this, blah blah blah) honestly I was on her side but it didn't really matter. They shouldn't have been having a personal argument in front of me, so I said guys, stop. And she gives me the nastiest look. 

Eventually they make up, all the while I'm just sitting there awkwardly. He goes outside to smoke a cigarette and I said I was sorry, I didn't mean to start an argument. And she says that me saying Guys, stop, was Unecessary and unhelpful, this kind of caught me off guard so I sort of just let it go in the moment. But I'm still really bothered by it. I don't think I was obligated to A) sit there and listen to them argue, or B) Be helpful in an argument that had nothing to do with me at that point. I think I was totally justified in asking them to stop arguing.

Like I said, I just let it go in the moment, but I'm still really bothered that she felt like I was the one in the wrong here. Should I tell her this or should I just let it go? I feel like enough time has passed that it would be kind of petty to bring it up again, especially since I acted like everything was fine after. I have anxiety and get really panicky when it comes to confrontation, so if I choose to say something it's going to be a pretty big emotional and physical ordeal for me and I'm wondering if it's worth it or if I should just pick my battles.

(20 minutes north of our house, about 25 minutes from the college). this is extremely frustrating to me because i take all online college courses so i just sit around waiting for her classes to end. no gas money or even a thank you has ever been provided to me. if ever i have a proctored exam or something like that and i can't take my sister to school, my mom acts as if ive ruined her whole life due to the rearranged gym schedule.

My sister-in-law clawed her way into my family. Everyday while my twin was in boot-camp, she would come over to my house, and talk about how she couldn't wait for my twin to marry her and all that nonsense.



(She hated me, because I wouldn't put her on the  A cheerleading team a year prior. She honestly was horrible, but I felt like with a lot of practice, she could make the A team, so I tried putting her on the B team, but she refused the offer. I have always been nothing but nice to her, but she has pure hate towards me. I am a strong believer in Honey catches more flies than vinegar. I also really am bad at being mean. However, you can only keep your cool for so long.) 



My family nor I really like this her. l, because she is seriously, absolutely crazy. She sent an innocent man to prison over a false allegation, and she is proud of the fact! (She tried to kill herself twice, before she started seeing my twin.)



During my twin's time in boot camp (8 weeks) she sent him 167 letters. The boot camp graduation was supposed to be family only. We get there to discover her, and the rest of her crazy family there. The first thing she did when she saw my brother, was snatch him up and put her arm around him, like she had a prize. She wouldn't even let us speak to him privately. She clung to him. So, my twin decides to spend his free time with us, and he told her he would see her the next day, she had the worst meltdown I have ever seen. So, my twin walked her to her car, and I was standing behind my twin, and all I see in the backseat is wedding magazines, and pages of circled engagement rings. 




After that fiasco, my twin spent his five days of leave off with her. Next thing you know, I get a call saying they are getting married in two months. So, and this point, he has only spent three weeks with her.




 So my twin goes back to his base, and my family and I are vising him. We are sitting in a Village Inn, and her Mom calls telling my twin that he needs to go pick up this specific ring that day, at that moment. My Mom refused to take him to pick up the ring. A few minutes later, her mom calls my mom, and asks how much my mom and my father wanted to put towards the wedding. My mom said not a cent, and hung up her phone.




So, we talk to my brother, and try to knock some sense into him. He calls her, and says he wanted to hold off on the wedding, so our brothers could come. Through the phone I hear what sounds like a banshee, and inaudible words. 




 My brother takes leave, and goes to see her for five days. A few weeks later he is back at base, we go up to see him, he is different. 



His personality changed, he was a total dick, and he said that he is going to do what he wants, and all that.


So, they get married and one of the tackiest weddings I have ever seen. A bunch of her family is there. Due to such short notice, only three of us including myself made it to the wedding.

He is completely different. He acts like a total dick, and says mean things. He doesn't really  acknowledge our brothers or our baby niece. But, he acknowledges her family. He calls her Mom, Mom. And her Dad, Dad. And claims her siblings as his own. 




My twin called me once asking for money, so his wife's vehicle wouldn't be repossessed. I said no. He then told me I was a piece of shit, and a horrible sister.

26927,Non-Romantic,2za2qt,"Here's a little bit of background information on how we started talking:

So at the start of the semester I received a really short email, it's a girl writing to me in Russian. She gave me her name and phone number and told me that I was in one of the same classes as her. Ok so I thought that was really weird cause who just gives out their number like that? She didn't write anything else either. Then I spoke to my friends about the email and they told me hey, maybe she emailed you cause she saw that you have a Russian name and she might not have many friends in class so she's just trying to reach out to someone who speaks the same language as her. So then I felt bad about ignoring the email and decided to text her and say hi. We find each other in the next class. She seems shy but nice. We then discover that we are in actually 2 of the same classes. Cool.

But then I start getting really annoyed cause she would text me all the time. She'd text me asking me about what music I like to listen to, what movies do I like, do I have a boyfriend, what's my daily life like, what colour eyeshadow do I think she should wear with her outfit tomorrow. I don't even text my closest friends as often as she'd text me. I tried to get her to stop the frequent texting by taking hours to reply and if I didn't reply to her within the next day she'd asking me what's up and I'd just keep telling her I'm super busy and can't talk much. She asked me to hangout with her during the week break we had but I told her I was too busy with schoolwork so I can't. Needless to say, she remains very persistent in trying to create a close friendship with me. 

I was cool with being classmates with her and saving each other a seat for class, but we really have nothing in common apart from the fact that we both know Russian. She also has no real sense of humour. I just don't feel like pursuing a friendship with someone I can't connect to, but she seems to really want to be my friend.

**Ok so here is where things get really weird...**

She adds me on facebook. I notice that she shared a really weird photo on her wall. The picture was basically indicating that youth today are being brainwashed with accepting stuff like multiculturalism, homosexuality, the death of 6 million jews, white privilege, communism, etc. ...I'm not sure what to make of this and search what else she's uploaded. She has an album with over 60 images with the title partei :). So I click to see what kind of party she's making an album out of. Oh. It's not just any party. It's the fucking nazi party. Images of Hitler driving down the streets of Germany with a massive crowd of thousands doing the salute and buildings after buildings decorated with nazi flags. What really upset me was the picture of a group of blond German girls to which she captioned beautiful &lt;3.  

Beautiful?! I don't even know what to tell her when I see her for the first time in class tomorrow since I've made that discovery. She even asked me if I wanted to meet up today but I've been ignoring her because of this. I've been to Israel and listened to a Holocaust survivor share her story about what she had to endure. I love all my Jew friends, my Muslim friends, my Christian friends, and my Atheist friends. I've cried with joy at my black gay friends wedding. I'm wondering if she perhaps was raised with this mentality since she's from Ukraine and part of them did join the Nazis which means that maybe her family was on that side? Part of me wishes I could convince her to see things differently, but if she's been grown up and raised to see things in such a dark light then I doubt I could change her mind. This is the first time I've ever knowingly met someone with such a mentality. What do I tell her when I see her in class tomorrow? I have no idea how to bring up this topic.

26931,Non-Romantic,3g2pu3,"My paternal grandparents are Catholic, moderately homophobic, quietly racist conservatives. Quietly, unless they get and subsequently send out chain emails declaring how Muslims will be our downfall, or that Jews suck, or that the nonreligious left will destroy the country, or that sex is destroying America's youth.  Always more eloquently stated, always sounding pseudo-scientific.

They've been sending these emails to my parents for years now.  My mom grew up Jewish (they didn't approve of my dad marrying her, but seem to be  okay with her, other than the occasional antisemitic email chain).  My parents raised us nonreligiously.

Both of them have told my grandparents they don't want these emails, but they still come frequently enough that my mom blocked their emails until they eventually called her out on it.  

I'm convinced they haven't given up on trying to convert me to being religious and conservative.  For christmas, I was the only of the 6 kids in the family who got a foam tic-tac-toe board with crosses and Jesus fish as the Xs and Os.  They tried to police my facebook, calling up my mom and aunt (asking her to talk to my mom) about being incredibly inappropriate.  What I'd done wrong was use the words dammit, and pisses me off, in a couple of ranting facebook posts, and post a photo of myself in a swimsuit, with several other people in swimsuits.

The email my grandma sent me today is the same one my grandpa sent to my mom a few days ago.  It's a racist essay, one of the things someone would use to justify not-so-random security checks of people in turbans at the airport, so much so that one of the lines is actually Some would say that I'm being racist saying this, but. . .  My mom's reaction, sent to my grandpa was just the word Racist.  Now he's upset with her.  I'm amused with my mom's response.

Despite this, they sent me the same email two days later.  Like I said, I don't think they've given up.

Is there some response that could make them more likely to stop sending me these emails, especially to my school email?  I was thinking something like, Hi, Grandma.  I'd appreciate if you wouldn't put me on any of your chain emails any more.  Based on the emails you've sent my mom, and this email, I don't have the same moral beliefs as you that would lead me to pass these emails forward.  If your goal is to get this out to as many people as possible, I'm the wrong person to be sending this to.  If you're trying to save me, it's not going to do anything.  I could do a line-by-line analysis of why this email offends me and is a waste of my meager inbox space, but I think it'll suffice to say that the only thing this or other chain emails will do is strain our relationship, and I don't want that.

26935,Non-Romantic,3irx0r,"Background: I live in an apartment off-campus with 4 of my friends from college. As a part of our lease, we were given two free parking spots, which are located in the parking garage associated with our apartment unit. We also had an option to purchase additional parking spots for $75/month each, however these spots are located at a different parking garage (about a 7 minute walk from our apartment building to the car.)


Since there are 5 of us who all needed to have our cars with us at school, we decided to draw names randomly to see who would get the two spots in our apartment garage, and everyone else would park in the other garage. To keep it fair, we split the cost of the parking between all 5 of us, so instead of 3 people paying $75/month, we all would pay $45/month. 


When we drew names, I and one other girl (we'll call her Bari) got the two spots. Everyone else purchased separate parking passes for the other garage. Fast forward to today: one of the other girls brought up the idea of re-drawing names for the next semester. Her reasoning was that if we are all paying the same price ($45/month) it is not fair that two of us get the more convenient spot that is right next to our apartment while the rest of them have to walk further to their car. She also mentioned that she has to get up at 6 am for work and she doesn't feel comfortable walking over to the other parking garage by herself. Bari said that she is okay with that right away, and I said that I would be open to think about other options but we shouldn't decide anything until the entire group is together. 


My issues with this: first of all, I think the reasoning that she feels unsafe walking there at 6 am is bullshit. It's literally a block over and it's a popular area for student housing, so there's a lot of street lights, people walking around, university cops patrolling, etc. I parked my car there last year and had no problems. Additionally, she is not the only early riser in our apartment; she only has to get up that early once or twice a week. Bari and I both like to go to the gym early in the morning so we also leave the apartment around 5:30-6am for 5-6x a week. 

I do see her point that us all paying $45/month but having unequal convenience in terms of our parking location can be unfair. And if we had decided initially that we'd get to redraw names at the beginning of each semester obviously I'd have no problem with that. *However*, my argument is that **this is the arrangement that we had all agreed to months before we actually moved in and drew names.** We all had plenty of time to think about the situation, consider alternatives, etc. If this was going to be a problem, she could have brought it up to us way earlier. But she didn't say anything until she *didn't* get the spot. That, to me, just seems like she's all butthurt because she got the bad end of the deal when drawing names. I feel like if the situations were reversed, I wouldn't feel justified in asking for a redraw and she probably wouldn't agree to it either. 

I'm kind of torn between three options here. A part of me feels like maybe I should just agree to give up my spot at the end of the semester (since the cost would be the same and 7 minutes is not a *terrible* inconvenience except maybe with groceries) and just avoid conflict. However, another part of me feels like I should stand my ground and not get taken advantage of/let other people push me around. Finally, I could agree to a different compromise. (i.e. I'd pay a bit more for the convenience or something)

So reddit, what do you think? Am I in the wrong here for not wanting to give up my spot? Should I just be a team player and give up my spot?

26940,Non-Romantic,3g6gll,"**tl;dr**: Parents are caring hard-working decent people but never show an interest in me, their only child who has always lived at home, I've overcome mental issues that mostly stem from this, I'm about to move out and think my existence at home has been damaging to my life.

My parents [60] are your average, quiet people with no bad qualities, comfortable lives, my childhood was excellent, it was from 18+ that set me on my current path.

I'm successful in my work-from-home job but I've been through periods of self-diagnosed depression and social anxiety over the years that I kept hidden. Never have I been asked if I'm okay when my mood has been obviously poor in the evening, ex. I once didn't speak to my mother for 3 weeks before she asked if she'd done anything to upset me - she had said something out of order and didn't apologise at the time, I had to ask for an apology.

Between 19-21 my life drifted, I had a part-time job but stayed indoors most of the time, disconnected from all but 1 or 2 friends. During this time living at home was hell, I was hounded every day about finding a job without an offer of help as surely they could tell I was struggling, I'd built a resilience and withdrew from the world even more. Quit my job.

I cried myself to sleep at 21 scratching at my wrists wondering if I could go through with it. I was broke, had no way of moving out. They had no idea I was this deep into what I now realise was a depression, I felt like a prisoner.

I taught myself my trade from 21-23 and whenever I got some money I gave them a big chunk for rent, they were grateful and interested in where I'd got it from. Still they weren't convinced I could make a living from my work.

Social anxiety developed here as I'd been without normal social interaction for many years and hated my appearance. This brought back periods of depression and the vicious cycle continued, being socially anxious means you don't reach out for help and with no one asking if I'm fine I just did it all by myself.

24 to now, I struck gold in my work, I bought a car to treat myself (parents asked how much it was, said it's nice if you can afford it etc - genuinely positive)

I started paying rent, nice holidays, clothes, and so on. Depression cycle was mostly gone, social anxiety still affecting most of my life when interacting with people but I hid it well.

At 27, mother asked if I'd be able to financially support myself on my own (I knew I was worth more than them by this point), I was always told I can stay there as long as I like and they just want me to be happy. In hindsight my anxiety stopped me moving out, I didn't know what I was doing and couldn't ask for help. It would be like admitting defeat to them in my head.

My father by this point has literally not asked a single thing about what I do or how my life is going, what my plans are, nothing. It's simply daily chat about the news, sport, science, weather, everything but personal things.

Neither of them seemed concerned about my lack of friends or girlfriends and that every week was identical for years but the odd mention of grandchildren came up. The times I nearly blew all my internal pent up rage at them for that.

Today I still live at home and I'm about to move out, my social anxiety is nearly gone through my own determination and this year I've got a girlfriend, gone to various parts of the country for 1-3 days a few times to see shows and events. Big lifestyle change out of nowhere.

They comment on appearance flaws of people on TV when sometimes I have those exact flaws, they have no idea.

26955,Non-Romantic,2fcu54,"My brother has been forever troubled and has been in-and-out of prison for all of his adult life, and some of his teen life has been spent in jail and juvy too. His crimes go anywhere from stealing police cars, resisting arrest, grand theft auto, general grand theft, some type of murder-assisting charge, and the list goes on and on. Every time he is released, he ends up back in jail or prison within 2 weeks. I have gone to visit him quite a few times and when I do, he seems level headed, wanting to do better, promising to get help for himself, etc.

As soon as we leave the prison from visiting, though, he just gets in more trouble and back in lockdown. I've never been arrested so I literally have no clue what it is like to be in jail or prison.

A side story is that he has been caught several times using a cell phone in prison. Apparently this is a serious offense, but he keeps somehow acquiring a cell phone to use in there. He calls me EVERY SINGLE DAY from those cell phones, but I stopped answering the phone 6 months ago. He still calls and calls and calls.

Back when I used to actually answer the phone, we would have pleasant conversation. He always promises to do better, promises to join the jail church, whatever education system they have in jail, etc. He somehow also found out that I have a pretty substantial income these days; I guess my other family members clued him in on this or something. He always wants money when he calls. I talked to my family about this and he never asks them for money... 

Now, I am glad to send my brother money every once in a while, but he asked me a few times to buy a Green Dot money pack and give him the card number so that he can use. I've never been to jail or prison or anything, but I suspected that this is probably illegal and I refused to do it anymore after I did it twice. I talked to my mom about it and she says to only send him money using legal methods that the prison allows. I agreed, and since she talks to him more often I just started giving her money to send to him, probably no more than about $100 per month.

But my brother keeps calling and calling and calling and leaving voicemails asking me to send him a green dot card, and I refuse. I think he is running some type of prison scam but I can't be sure. Annoyed, I stopped answering his calls and sending money altogether 6 months ago.

I'm not even sure what to ask here.... should I ever send someone money in prison? Doesn't the state take care of them for their necessities while there? Should I feel like a douchebag for not wanting to talk to him about his false promises and he getting me involved in his possible prison scams? I don't know what to think really. Thanks Reddit!

26960,Non-Romantic,2imnxb,"We'll call the dude in question Rory. I won't get into the terribly long story behind all of it, but we share a mutual friend I'll call Tom (my best friend, Tom and Rory also go way back to middle school and Tom's parents essentially adopted Rory when he was 16 so they're like brothers). Rory and I weren't friends long, but when we were it was a very powerful and memorable friendship. Rory, Tom, and I made a great trio despite us all living in different corners of the country now. Our friendship occurred when we both were at a low point in our lives and very lonely, so the three of us chatted on skype almost nightly. At the time, Tom and I were the only friends Rory was talking to consistently. We were a great support system for each other. We saved money and went on a roadtrip together and it was amazing. I still remember details of it quite vividly. As a shy and socially anxious person at the time, he made me feel very at ease. 

I fell for Rory hard, but Tom had a huge thing for me for years. I knew this. Rory knew this. Tom gave us his blessings because he was dating casually and didn't like seeing Rory and I so lonely. Rory wasn't sure if he wanted to go with me though because obviously we lived far away from each other and Tom liked me. He also claimed to not be sure how he felt. But then he would turn around and claim to be very much into me. Not knowing what he wanted, I guess, he strung me along for about 6 months of what felt like total agony. I was infatuated with him, but I don't think he realized how much because I can keep pretty aloof, especially when I'm not sure how the other party feels. Any time I'd start to give up he'd come back and give me some,  sometimes not so subtle, indication that he was ready for something. Even suggesting he move out over where I am. 

But when he was off he would avoid talking about it, Tom saying that Rory said he didn't know what to say and felt so hopeless that he was upsetting me so much. Tom also felt helpless because he was continuously telling Rory he was a dick for what he was doing, and then telling me Rory isn't in touch with his feelings and would keep hurting me even if we did enter a relationship so I should give up. I didn't want to.  This carried on basically until he met another girl and he told me AFTER things got serious and after being distant for weeks.

The aftermath was terrible. I told Rory I couldn't be friends anymore. I was near suicidal (not just because of him but other reasons and he was the straw that nearly broke the camels back), Tom felt he couldn't trust him anymore, and I would cry myself to sleep almost nightly. I'd talk to Tom on the phone every night to have someone to talk to but we'd end up fighting every time.  From what I hear from Tom, Rory felt terrible. If they talked on skype with webcam and my name come up Tom would notice an overall negative change in his body language and he'd look really sad. He said he regrets everything he did to me and wants to take it all back.

In our last conversation he said he wants me to take as much tme as I need to heal before talking to him again, but he really wants us to be friends again someday. He says he's 100% at fault, he feels terrible, he cares for me very much, and I'm 100% justified in never talking to him again. I said it depends on how I feel, but he won't hear from me for a very long time.  He said he's happy it will even happen at all. That was in February. I deleted him on Facebook in April when him an his new girl were official on there and they started posting pics together. Once they were official though, for some reason it became that much easier to get over him. I also had a positive turn around in life and while things aren't the best they can be I feel even better than I did BEFORE all that happened with him.

A few months ago it occured to me that I wasn't angry anymore. Hearing his name didn't make tears well in my eyes and when Tom would say funny things Rory said I'd laugh, or good things happening in his life it'd make me very happy for him. Tom and I joke about what a jerk he his sometimes, but I genuinely wish the best for him in life and I still love and care for him as a friend very much. The thing is, I'm telling myself I don't think I could ever fall for him again. Now that I'm out of those love blinders I know it wouldn't work out anyways. I'm very in touch with my emotions and can express them in a healthy way and he isn't and is passive aggressive at times. As a friend he knows how to give great advice but in a relationship he can't handle seeing an SO in distress. 

Now I'm doing ok, have a few people I'm kinda digging and I'm finally crushing on other people again (which I couldn't for a while when this was going on). Tom and I have a healthy friendship thats even stronger through all the fights. Tom and Rory are a little distant but mostly because Rory has been busy and seems to be doing really well now, but there is a LITTLE bitterness on Tom's end still. 

I'm considering hitting him up soon, and Tom said Rory made a comment about how he hopes he can hear from me again, but I have a few concerns. I want to say that I know he feels bad and all, but he has a tendency to say mean things by accident (if he knew it hurt your feelings he'd beat himself up for it forever) . I'm afraid that even if I feel better now, talking to him again will bring up old feelings OR bitterness. 

ALSO, I should mention, in his relationship history he has an apparent habit of not knowing how he feels until it's WAAY too late. When his ex wanted him back he said mean things to get her to go away and once she moved on he realized he still loved her 3 years later. He's realized he wants girls he's rejected before. Once it becomes unattainable for him suddenly she's the love of his life. I'm afraid that if him and his gf break up (which apparently they aren't doing so hot) I'll be that girl once I show him I'm not interested in him like tha t anymore and I don't think I ever can. Something is telling me I'm setting myself up for an impending disaster and another part of me really really really misses him. For a one year friendship, he's one of the best I've had. What would you do Reddit?

26980,Non-Romantic,2cnep9,"So I have this friend, lets call him Adam. He and I have been part of the same group for 2 years. I asked the group to live with me this year (we are in college) and the group as a whole pushed me away (it wasn't immediate but a gradual push toward them living together and me not living with them.) The first person that I asked to live with was Adam and he was the only one to not push me away. I did my best to try and make him feel welcome and wanted but in the end he chose to live with the rest of the group instead of me. 

I confronted the group as a whole for cutting me out and they tried to find an apartment that would fit us all. We found one, but in the end it didn't work out and they blamed me for it. 

Fast forward to today. I have tried to make amends with the group and apologized for my role in the apartment problem but they no longer speak to me and haven't asked me to hang out in 4 months. We aren't friends but I am on civil terms with all except one of them. Adam came to me saying he still wanted to be my friend and we made amends. I have been hanging out with him on a consistent basis but I am always the one to initiate contact. Recently I asked him to go to the movies and he had already seen the movie with the group. He always does things with the group and doesn't think to invite me so I asked him why. He told me that he thinks it would be too awkward with the other guys, which is understandable. But the thing is he never invites me to anything. He is always hanging out with the group and I feel like the times he does blow me off are just him prioritizing them over me. 

The problem I am having can pretty much be summed up that I put so much effort into my friendship with Adam, but I don't think he really cares. I am having a really hard time because I have lost all of my best friends (or at least the people I thought were friends) over a fucking apartment. I need a friend right now and I thought that Adam and I could still be friends but it makes me feel even shittier about myself every time I realize how often he picks them over me without even thinking about how I might feel.

Since she stopped taking the medication, her condition has become worse and worse.

26988,Non-Romantic,3gninq,"A little back story:

I've been great friends with my roommate for years (7ish). No problems whatsoever. 

We live in San Francisco, and both would like to move in with our significant others, but cannot due to the insane housing market.



1 1/2 years ago I get promoted in our company to a position where he and I have to do a fair amount of work together. This is no problem, still friends, all is well on that front to this day. 

A little over a year ago, a really nice loft became available through one of his friends, we jump on it, and have been living together ever since. The place is big, tall ceilings, nice kitchen area, nice bathroom etc.. The only thing is the rooms are built out of sheet rock with no insulation, and it is very warm half the year, so we leave our own respective doors and windows open a lot. Basically, there is not very much privacy as far as sound goes. We knew that going in, and honestly it hasn't bothered me that much.

fast forward to 6-8 months ago. We have both started dating people who are over a lot. Dinners that we would all share, and movies we would watch together became more and more infrequent, and eventually stopped altogether. Now it's almost as if the person, or couple to occupy the living room first, 'gets' the living room for the night. Keep in mind it's a loft, and our rooms are small (mine is even smaller than his, and lofted up 6), so most of our place is 'the living room'. In the living room is a flatscreen TV, xbox one, big leather chair, all of which I own, and a crappy couch that came with the place.

Lately my roommate has been in a shit mood most of the time. He chalks it up to that it's just the way he is, and he's actually not pissed or grumpy. Work stress, ex-wife stress.. Whatever, I let it slide. Actually I feel like I let pretty much everything slide, which is probably one of the reasons I'm in this situation now..

Anyway, these little things keep adding up, such as he won't get a new thing of toilet paper when it's his turn. Or, I can't find my spare tube of toothpaste, only later to find it half empty in his toiletry bag.
We share the same big bottle of Dr. Bronners soap (which I buy), and doesn't get replaced except by me. He starts leaving dishes in the sink for days at a time, and all the while is moving my things from our common areas to 'my area' under my bedroom, where I have a desk with art supplies, and my camping gear.

All these things are slowly chipping away at my normally care-free/let-it-slide attitude. I talk with my GF about it frequently, and she agrees it's disrespectful on his part. I know he has a short fuse though, and becomes pretty much impossible to talk to when he gets upset. So I keep letting things slide. 

He also is extremely protective of our place and has been known to throw full on hissy fits if people (all mutual friends of ours) he didn't know were coming over show up at the 'wrong' time. His GF is usually pretty good at diffusing these outbursts, but considering how infrequently anyone aside from our Girlfriends are over, it just seems ridiculous. 

It was about a month ago though when I began to become officially fed up with his shit. 
It was my GF and I's one year anniversary and we wanted to cook a romantic dinner and drink a bottle of wine then go out for a bit. 
So a day or two before, at work, I go and talk to my roommate, and ask if he wouldn't mind staying out of the house for two hours from 7-9, so we could have our dinner and whatnot without disturbing anyone, or being disturbed. This request was met with a very hostile NO, you can't ask me to stay out of my house.. bah blah blah.. what do expect me to do? go sit at a bar for two hours? I respond with Uh yeah, sit at a bar. Go for a bike ride. Fuck your mother. Anything as long as you're out of the house for two hours. (i didn't say the part about his mother) Hours later he agreed, but made it into a much larger thing then it should have been. In fact he didn't even come back at all that night out what I can only assume was angst.

This past month and a half my GF and I have had a lot of weekend trips. We've only been in town for one weekend. So I figure he's gotten a lot of time to himself, and he and his lady have had plenty of alone time in the apartment or whatever. 

Then yesterday, I leave work, and buy a new video game with the intention of having a solo night to kill a 6'r and play the game. When I get home, my roommate is there watching netfilx on my xbox (my account too). I ask him if he would mind watching on his laptop on the couch so I can play the game (I have headphones and always scoot the leather chair right up to the TV when I play, and am pretty much completely out of the way when I do this.) 

He then goes into this whole thing about how he hasn't been home days, and just wants one night to chill and watch TV alone. I say thats fine, but I can only play video games on this device/TV, and you have a laptop and can watch on the couch. He gets mad and keeps going on about how he's never here, it's just for this one time, I have to hear you and your GF bang all the time, and blah blah blah. To which I respond  we both have to hear each other bang, its been happening the whole time we've lived here. also YOU choose to not be around as much, I don't mind sharing this space, you're the one who makes it a big deal. This is what we signed up for when we moved into a 'Loft' style apartment in San Francisco, move out if you don't like it, etc..

Then there was some name calling, and I said fuck it, watch whatever, and went to my room for the night. 

I'm just pissed off now, and wondering how to handle the inevitable shitty conversation we need to have. And what the opinions of you 3rd party readers might be on the matter.

Thanks for reading!

26993,Non-Romantic,377s3r,"**Wall of text ahead, tl;dr at the end.**

We have two younger siblings. Our family doesn't have economic troubles, and my parents were good students. I've always been a good student and liked going unnoticed in school. 

She, on the other hand, really liked (and likes) being the center of attention. She has always been very **dreamy**, and everyone who meets her for the first time says she's extremely **sweet** and **sensitive**.

* I used to tease her as a big sister-little sister thing, but I never felt it was too much. My sister was younger so she used to get the support of my parents, specially from our mother, so I was grounded quite often.

* When she was 6-8, our cousin (her same age) told me she didn't like it when we went to her house because my sister would steal from her. She also took a little cheap toy from a store once. She then started taking money from my parents and grandparents, and from me and our little brother from time to time, but just enough for buying candy or magazines.

* I felt that she behaved like she was the main character in a movie. If she argued with a friend, or a teacher got angry at her, or I teased her a little more than usual, then we became the 'villains'. When she was 13 she spilled whipped cream over the hair of a girl in her cooking class, because the girl had been mean to her or something like that. And she always had our mother on her side to support her. 

I feel that her behaviour has **worsened** since I left for college. She started stealing more money because she started smoking. After she took around $60 from my parents' house within a week, they started hiding their money. Even my mother somethimes hides her wallet under the pillow. 

* She started failing exams, and when my father took her digital camera or her mobile phone from her, she would steal enough money to buy new ones in secret. She has bought at least two or three digital cameras and a mobile phone (my father kept finding those and taking them away), and she made her friends lend her mobile phones when she couldn't afford new ones. 

* My father threatened my sister with sending her to a **boarding school**. One week later, my father caught her writting in a notebook a kind of invented journal where my sister was telling how hard life in the boarding school was, but that at least there was a hottie who made everything better in there.

She made very clear that she didn't want to spend her teenage years as I had, because I had studied a lot and from her point of view **I have been wasting my life**. 

* She failed every exam so my parents got her a tutor. She goes to this woman's house with other kids and they are given mock-exams and such. The tutor told my parents she was improving, but my sister cheated in these exams, so she still failed school exams. She even stole a mobile charger from her tutor, who phoned my parents and made her return it.

* She failed last year of high school and is repeating the year, and she has failed most of her exams again. She got a piercing in her belly button twice without my parents knowing (because when my father found out, he would throw it away), and last year she got a tattoo that my father still doesn't know of, because my mother hid it from him. The money for those was stolen.

She sometimes goes very aggresive. Two months ago I saw she was hiding a box, and when I asked her about what she was keeping in there, she pushed me out of her bedroom and tried to close the door, pushing it as hard as she could although I had put my thigh in there so that she couldn't close it. She has recently had a big argument with a friend of hers, so she took a utility knife to school and ripped her ex-friend backpack. I think she has only hit my brother and I, though.

I've just arrived home after a couple of months, and she keeps smoking and has shown me proudly the nipple piercing she got last week (no one else in the family knows about it). She also bragged about having had intentional unprotected sex and about having taken the morning-after pill.

My father works a lot so he can't control her. He is really desperate because whenever he grounds my sister, my mother will still let her go out without telling him. When anyone tells my mother about it, she plays the victim and says that she's always in the middle of everything and that we do not understand. My sister also plays the victim amazingly well, and she bad-mouths my father with her friends and the rest of the family.

My father took her to a **psychologist** last year. The psychologist said that my sister did all that because she felt a lot of pressure, because everyone in our family has been to college and I was very hard-working, and that my parents should be more understanding, but that they had no reason to worry because my sister was really **nice** and **sweet** and sensitive.

I care about this because I love my parents and I want my siblings to learn how to behave properly (and she is a fucked up role model for them). Right now I feel that I can't talk to my sister about anything because she only talks to me when she wants to boast about something.

Is there anything I can do?


**TL;DR**: My sister steals money, doesn't study, boasts even about stupid things she does and she thinks my father hates her. My mother is always on her side, and hides from my father stuff she does. Nobody knows what to do.

27013,Non-Romantic,227ehu,"I work for a small company (my office has 5 employees) and was hired at the same time as this woman who I'll just call A. Our boss split up a large managerial role between us two so we could utilize our individual strengths and weaknesses. We get paid exactly the same salary.

Well, it's been about six months, and the following has emerged -- 

a) My roles and responsibilities have significantly increased. I've been assigned a lot of the client-facing roles, so I'm out of the office for meetings pretty often, and when I'm in the office, I'm pretty busy creating the reports, analyzing data, coordinating, etc. I'm the first one in the office, generally the last to leave, and I take great pride in my work. It is pretty clear that my boss sees my potential, which is why he's giving me this kind of work.

b) Meanwhile, my co-worker has been assigned the more menial tasks -- she's in charge of all the data entry, filing, office supply management, and some customer service stuff. However, her e-mail is the main information email/phone line, so she gets swamped with inquiries. She is expected to know the information, but doesn't, so she either gives them the wrong information or gets overwhelmed and forgets to reply completely (which pisses off our customers and clients). We've received a couple complaints already that people keep trying to get a hold of our office but can't, or that they've ordered something and have yet to receive it, etc. 

c) Since I'm seeing her get so logged up and overwhelmed, I offer to help her (especially since we hired to be a team). I'll explain the procedures and information to her, or teach her how to do something on the computer, with the hopes that she won't need my help the second time around, but nope. Every. single. time. She'll ask for my help because she forgot or hates doing this stuff. At this point, it's eating into my work productivity and starting to stress me out. Now I am pretty much doing her work, mine, and putting out the fires that she's started. 

d) I also need to mention that she is kind of a terrible employee. My boss comes in for meetings when he can, but he is generally out of state for work or at his home-office so he doesn't see much of it, except for her completed work (which, most of the time, I've done). He is a really accommodating and forgiving guy, even though she's late literally every day, calls out at least once a week (sometimes because she doesn't feel like going today), and leaves in the middle of the day to grab coffee with a friend or get a hair appointment. She still has no idea what our company does or what kind of services we offer.

e) I feel torn because she is actually a really good friend of mine. We've become really close, and outside of work, she is great. I feel obligated to be nice to her and help her out because she's my friend, but her ineptitude at work just drives me mad. At the same time, I kind of don't want to see her go.

So I don't really know how to air my grievances to my boss or even mention this issue in an appropriate manner. I would also like to mention a pay increase for me since I've basically taken up a promotion to her, but feel like I would get shot down due to the team part of the whole thing. What do I do?

I just got home from a dinner with my sister, her family, our mother and step-father. At the END of it my sister asked me how I was. When I told her I was extremely overworked she just kind of laughed and made a face that said you don't even know what it's like to be stressed. I told her I wasn't going to let her keep treating me this way, since it wasn't the first time, got up and got in my car. She came after me and accused me of not helping her when she was pregnant and crying, calling me if I could come over, not seeing my nephews often enough, not helping her now when she is going crazy with two children.


My situation: I work 10 to 11 hours a day 5 days a week without breaks at the moment, I have a lot of responsibility at work and it's piling on because a colleague was fired and I am the only person who can take on his projects (very small company). Also I work on the side a lot (atm) because I have debts to pay off. So there really is very little time I have to myself in silence. Also I suffer from depression. I was in therapy and on medication but somehow I just stopped both. I know it's time to go back, as I feel that I'm about to break and I will call my therapist first thing on monday, so don't worry about me here. But as most of you know depression can also mean exhaustion and pulling back from people. Also besides some close friends my work ist the only thing that feels right in my life at the moment.

Her situation: She is a SAHM. She went back to work for a while but realized she was pregnant again soon after. Her husband stayed home for the first four weeks after their second baby, but is now back at his job. My older nephew is in daycare from mornings until the afternoon. Before they had the first baby she loved work and had a good career (and talked about work all the time, complaining sometimes, too) but they always wanted children. They tried for three years and couldn't conceive. Then she got pregnant and miscarried. Then it worked twice in less than two years. I always supported her, tried to keep our mother in check who thought telling her how badly she wanted grandchildren would somehow get her pregnant, or by staying with them over night when she got the first contractions, even telling my bosses I might have to call in etc. Her husband is a successful manager and works extremely long hours.

I already mentioned how the fight started and to be fair, I don't help a lot or even see them often although we live close to each other. I honestly don't see why I really should help them on a regular basis though. First of all I didn't even know it was so bad for her at the moment, it was the first I really heard of it today. Second she has a husband. I felt like she was basically telling me to work less so I could help her more, while he is out being important. Third she really, really, desperately wanted these kids. We suffered with them for years when she couldn't get pregnant excused her moods etc. and now that she has them, all she does is complain how stressful it is, how bad it is that she can't spend much time with the firstborn because the newborn needs constant bodily contact. I have been feeling like a bad sister and aunt for a while now because they (although especially her husband) make snide remarks every time I do make time for them, like oh look a stranger and stuff like that. Also I should apparently call more...they never call me either although my sister is practically glued to her phone. They have a group of friends that they call their chosen family and they get basically all the quality time while I am called when they need a sitter. During the last weeks of her pregnancy she called me one night, asking what I was doing. When I told her that I was going to get my nails done she said something like ah ok. When I asked what was up she said nothing I just wondered if you'd like to come tonight instead of tomorrow. I told her if she needed me I would come, but she said it was fine. She sounded normal. Today she tells me she was crying during that call and that I was the worst for not coming, conveniently forgetting how I did call off a dinner with friends to babysit my nephew so she could go to pregnancy yoga, while her husband was working late (again) and other times I immediately came to help. 

So this is turning more into a rant. I really wish I had more time with them and my nephews and I already felt terrible before tonight and now I just feel like a piece of shit. On the other hand I feel like I did nothing wrong and that her completely disregarding the stresses in my life, while expecting me to fully understand hers and support her is very selfish. I mean it took her almost two hours to even ask me how I was...
We both apologized in the end and we both cried but somehow this doesn't feel right.

Please give me some perspective, I'm sitting here crying because we are a very close family and I love my sister.
   
**tl;dr**: My sister has two children she desperately wanted and now seems overwhelmed. Husband works long hours so she thinks I should work less and help her more.

27060,Non-Romantic,2zx0mn,"Some background, we're Asian so in Asian culture if you're younger there's a certain amount of respect you have to give to someone older than you when speaking or interacting with them. A cousin of mine has been acting like a little shit, he's 14 years old and has been speaking to other people quite rudely.

For example J is my little sister and is still 8 years older than him, but he talks to her very condescendingly. When she speaks to him or other people he gets surprised that she can be so smart he says to her. He is also making sexist comments and treats girls like their dumber than him. To me he's arrogant and tries to turn everything into a contest, he believes he can beat me in everything and tries to act cocky.

He lives with us and far away from his parents for school so it's up to us to teach him. So I talked about it with my girlfriend and she didn't seem to think it was a big deal until I told him my sister thought he was out of line too. I feel insulted that she didn't take my opinion into consideration, or maybe I'm being over sensitive about it.

Here is our text conversation:


Me: If he acts that way to you, tell me and also remind him that you are older than him so it's disrespectful, I see him do it all the time treating girls that way.

Her: Yeah I know, now that J has said something about it, maybe I should pay more attention to that.

Me: Man, I tell you something and you tell me I'm being over sensitive, but if J says it so now you pay more attention?

Her: Oh well it was only you before and now there's you and J so it seemed like it actually happened.

Me:  That's actually very insulting you said that.

Her:  I said I would pay more attention to it when you told me, didn't I?  So now after J's stuff I'll pay more attention, that's all.

Me:  You don't see how that's insulting to me that it was only me.  I'm not saying you should take everything I say as the word of God, but it feels like you disregard what I say immediately.

Her:  It's not what I was trying to say, I'm about to sleep I can't really text properly.

Me:  We can talk about it tomorrow but come on, you even said now that J said something you can actually believe it happened.

Me:  Did you think I was making it up or lying to you or something?

Her:  No, are you seriously trying to fight in the middle of the night?  I was sleepy so I didn't think much when I texted you, just talk later, I'm too tired I am going to sleep.

A year ago after I broke up with my first serious boyfriend I was for the first time single. 
I realised boys really liked me so I tried to date a lot of them but while I was doing this I was very distraught about my first boyfriend so I couldn't love or like any new boys. 
Now I have the diagnosis bipolar so that explains how emotional and up and down I was. 


Amongst these boys I met one (m20)(he was 19-18 while this was happening) I met him on one of the worst days of my life and he asked me out.
 I was really happy about it then, after two dates and one make out session I texted him and told him I didn't want to meet again; he was kind of weird, I wasn't emotionally invested at all and tbh I found an other boy whom I found hotter and who'd be good for what I wanted: a casual hook up, fwb. 
I never really thought about this after it happened.
Anyway, flash forward to this summer: more than a Year after we met. I had even forgotten his name. He sends me messages on Facebook. A Lot of them. 
They were long and weird. Like strange poems describing the strong emotions we had for each other and how Sad it was that it ended..... I was confused and scared. Mostly because he waited a year with this who seemed to be and obsession with me. 
Anyway I stopped answering his messages after I understood that he was crazy and I unfriended him. 


Yesterday he texts me with the same kind of messages about how wonderful it was and that I'm blocking my feelings for him and that to make us feel better we have to have a Conversation I even answered: the only thing that could make me 'feel better' is if you stop texting me! 


I'm starting to be actually scared, what if he doesn't stop? Even if Ill stop answering I'm uneasy now. I'm afraid that he'll do something in real life, because he is obviously crazy and I don't know what he could do... I have no idea what I should do! Help me reddit?

27070,Non-Romantic,2q5mdy,"**Some background:** I'm living in a house with two girls, one of which is my best friend of 13 years Amber and the other who we found through Facebook, Erica. I've been living with Amber for more than a year, and the second girl moved in in August. We have a third roommate who is moving out (on good terms) and another roommate, Trent moving in on the first. (22/M)

We've all become really close friends since Erica moved in, and we get along great – there's no cattiness, and we share friends. We've never fought about anything. 

**The only issue is** that I feel like I'm almost in a parental role with regard to my roommates. I'm the only person who takes initiative to do things that need to be done. If the kitchen gets messy, I'm usually the one who ends up cracking first and cleaning it all. If something breaks, it will sit there being broken until I fix it. If we need any type of service done, I'm the one who contacts the landlord and schedules it.

I've gotten the household to run smoothly for chunks of time in the past: I got everybody to meet up and talk a while back and we agreed to all take responsibility for our dishes and respective messes. That cut back on the amount of cleaning that was left for me... but eventually we all lapsed back into old habits and today I spent 5 hours cleaning the kitchen alone. 

Erica will tolerate slightly more messiness than I will, and if she's not busy, she'll usually pitch in if I ask for her help with cleaning. Sometimes she'll clean the kitchen on her own if she knows I'm especially busy with class.

Amber, on the other hand, is not a clean person. Even if there's something old and starting to rot in the fruit bowl, she'll ignore it until somebody else takes care of it. She doesn't like to do other people's dishes – if I ask her for help, she'll either claim that she's too busy or say that's not my dish. Sometimes she'll do the dishes – but only hers. Somehow she doesn't contribute to any collective messes. If the floor needs to be swept, she'll look down and go I didn't get coffee grounds all over the floor; I don't drink coffee. Hmm. Convenient. I suppose she also exfoliates so well that none of the dust in the house consists of her skin cells. 

This is the only thing that causes tension in the house. If I get on Amber's case, she'll get annoyed (after 13 years of friendship, I've learned to ignore it) but eventually do what I ask her to. Sometimes both Erica and I get frustrated with Amber, but neither of us are the type to hold grudges. 

Long story short, my roommates have a higher tolerance for messes than I do and I run the household. (My roommate's mom was actually the one to point out that I'm mom.)

Most of the roommate/cleaning-related posts I've seen on reddit are about petty revenge or just ranting about roommates. The thing is that I don't want to leave passive-aggressive notes on the fridge, and I don't want to do things like throw out my roommate's dirty dishes. That will just make things worse and ruin our friendship. I want to get the house running in a sustainable way that works for everybody. 

Does anybody have any methods that have worked well for them? I've tried chore charts and wheels, but neither seem to have worked – I may have not gone about it correctly. The chore wheel didn't divvy up chores well at all, and the charts were forgotten after the first few days. 

I'm not really sure what else to do. I don't really want to assign chores, because that seems overbearing. I would try to use some sort of incentive, but it's not like I can give my roommates an allowance.

I figure since we're transitioning between roommates entering into a new year, now is a good time to change how I go about this. I'm excited for Trent to move in because he likes to keep things neat, and he's also motivated enough to pursue tasks on his own. 

So... any ideas on what to do here? Has anything worked well for you guys in similar situations?

**A little more detail:**

* Most of the cleaning issues are common ones: not putting things back in their respective places, not finishing tasks (e.g. washing dishes and leaving them on the drying rack without putting them away,) saying I'll do it later and never getting around to it, forgetting about things... It's all totally understandable, but it builds up. 

* I'm guilty too! I don't always clean up after myself, but I'm working on it – and trying to get everybody else to follow my lead.

* I'm not entirely sure my roommates know *how* to clean. I think part of the reason I'm the one who steps up and gets things done is because I know how to do things efficiently. But I don't want to step in and say no, you shouldn't soap and rinse each dish individually – here, let me show you... because I don't want to be a backseat driver. But at the same time, if it takes me 10 minutes to do the dishes and my roommate 30 minutes... I don't know. Maybe it's worth it to show them? But what am I supposed to do, hold a workshop on a Saturday morning? 


---   

**TL;DR**: My roommates and I get along really well, but I want to figure out a sustainable method for running my house so I don't have to play the role of mom anymore. 

So, how do I:

1. Distribute chores to my roommates?

2. Make sure everybody actually does their share of work?

3. Keep this system working for extended periods of time?

27071,Non-Romantic,22j4vo,"I have a history of making friends, and then discovering 1-2 years into the friendship that my friends are assholes. Since I'm the one thing in common in all of these relationships, I'm assuming that there is something about me that either attracts these people to me or attracts me to them. I want to figure out what it is about me that makes this happen and change it, and I want to find new friends that are actually friends.

Here's a selection of people who I used to be friends with and either broke off the friendship or am currently trying to distance myself from:

Bob: We met last year when I started college, hit it off pretty well. I'm extremely introverted and academically oriented, and he is as well, so we would hang out occasionally and do homework together. We had what I thought was a pretty good friendship at first. This semester, we took a difficult project-based course together. He did no work, dropped the class to go become a TA for another class, and I ended up dropping the class because it was too late to get a new partner and I couldn't complete the project on my own. He thought the entire situation was hilarious and constantly mocked me for having to do all the work by myself, then mocked my attempts to get myself a new partner to retake the course next semester. I'm in the process of getting myself the hell away from this guy because seriously, not cool.

Alice: At first, she seemed like a smart, peppy, and fun person to be around, even though she was a little bit of a manic pixie dream girl. Now I know she may have lied about being raped last fall. Is lying about the current I haven't had my period in 3 months but I've never ever ever had sex with anyone, I swear, really pregnancy scare/attention whoring attempt. I'm not even touching this one with a ten-foot pole.

Carl: We were best friends in high school, had a bunch of nerdy hobbies in common and were in the drama program. Then he developed a crush on me and pursued me relentlessly despite the fact that he knew from the start that I am a lesbian. When I got a girlfriend, things got ugly really fast. I got the hell away when he began telling me that I owed him time and attention and calling my girlfriend all sorts of lovely names.

There's quite a few more, but you're probably bored of this. I seem to always make friends with nerdy people who seem normal at first, but then turn out to be either crazy or an asshole. I just want to make some normal friends who won't turn out to be insane a year from now. Am I too passive in my relationships? How do I tell if someone is going to turn out to be nuts? I must be missing a warning sign somewhere, because the recurring pattern seems to be a revelation out of the blue that I'm surrounded by assholes. Or am I just too picky about my friends?

27075,Non-Romantic,2qr0xk,"One of my best college friends broke up with her boyfriend in mid-October (he broke up with her). They were together around 2 years, we've been friends for five years. Her ex broke up with her because he felt he needed to go have fun with his friends and enjoy being 24 and single in New York City. For what it's worth, I never liked this guy and neither did any of our friends. He never cared to get to know her friends/family, did not reciprocate what she did for him, and barely acknowledged that she was even his girlfriend. 

She has not been handling the breakup well at all. Having gone through tough breakups before (the most recent in September!), I understand what she's going through. However, at this point, I don't know how to help her. I live two hours away from her so I can't see her all the time. She won't stop talking to him and because he's still texting her and saying maybe after a little bit he'll want to get back together with her, so she's holding onto hope of getting back together in the future. In my opinion, that's just not going to happen (and shouldn't happen - he's not the greatest guy). I went to visit her two weeks ago after not seeing her for about a month - as soon as I got in the door, she started crying and we had to cut our night out short because she was upset. Even as recently as today, she couldn't go to work because she was so sad over him. Obviously I know it's okay to be upset over the demise of a long-term relationship for a while, but I think her inability to do anything without being caught up about him is worrying.

I'm mostly concerned because she has a history of depression and refuses to go see a therapist or psychiatrist to find help or go on medication. Her prior behavior when it comes to breakups makes me take her comments that she can't go on alone seriously. When we lived together in college and she broke up with a former boyfriend, she locked herself in the bathroom and stopped responding. Myself and another friend had to break down the door and bring her to the hospital because she was non-responsive I believed she had taken something (I still don't know the details about what happened once I took her and she was okay, I did not want to pry). She is not that close with her family and does not talk to them about these problems. Another friend of hers has reached out to her family on one occasion about his concerns, but it appears they have not been able to get her help either. I worry because she constantly tells me things like I can't do this, I don't want to live without him, etc and refuses to imagine a future without him.

I would call her family myself to reiterate the seriousness of the problem, but when another friend did that (actually calling both her family and the police because she stopped responding...), she cut her off. Her well-being is my main concern but I'm afraid if I do that and her family does nothing, she will have no one else to talk to about these issues and no one will be able to detect future concerns. I've given her countless pep talks, shared my own struggles and experiences with breakups, going on anti-depressants, visiting multiple doctors, etc, but nothing I have done makes her believe there's a life out there for her. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do to help her?

or if I should ask him straight out.

He has also been having money issues - which are obvious to the family. 
he always seems to be buying things; DVD's, computer things, computer tablets.

My fiance and I plan on moving out at the end of our lease in August/September. We are getting married in November. Due to the high cost of living, wherever we end up moving will likely add $4-500 to our monthly bills, making it significantly harder to save. 

Ultimately, we would like to purchase a home within a year or two. My thoughts are that it would be easier to save if we had a roommate (like my sister) to help offset living expenses enabling us to save more.

John. We're all college students who work to pay bills as well as going to school so we don't make much.

We were all supposed to pitch in money for the entire trip from gas, hotel, food and other expenses while we're on our trip. We are taking my car because it has the least mileage and save money on renting a car. Now, everything is good and dandy. We all called out of work for the specific days we were going except the 4th friend named Mark

Mark has told us about 1 month ago that he was waiting on his work schedule to be posted before he could speak to his boss and call out. So we were unsure of his position on if he was going or not.

While we were in a waiting period, I told John that no hard feelings and I hoped he would understand that if Mark doesn't go, then I will not go either. I told him I do not want to be a third wheel on this week long trip especially because we discussed we could split off from one another and do our own thing when we got to Las Vegas.

So, obviously I could be a third wheel with the couple and cramp their style on the trip as well as in the hotel since we are sharing one room. Or I could pretty much be all alone on the trip while the couple do their own thing majority of the time.

We got confirmation from Mark that he has called out of work and is able to go. Everything is awesome, until LITERALLY a week before the trip, Mark tells us that he can't go due to some money problems or some BS excuse. 

No, John is asking me what my decision is, and I told him I would think about it. On one hand, I told him I wasn't going ahead of time if I would become a third wheel. On the other hand, I feel guilty now because now the expenses is going to be between 2 people and they won't be able to use my car. I don't know what to do.

She texted me and told me that management got on her for not doing the task. It may or may not have been busy. I wasn't there. 

There was another incident that happened a month or so ago where she was constantly asking to leave early for doctor appointments. She would ask to do this about once a week. Eventually, management told her she would need to start scheduling these appointments on her days off. Again she became upset and felt like they were picking on her. 

Issues like this are constantly happening and I often times agree with management on their decisions. I try to talk to her and sympathize every time something happens but, it is becoming harder and harder to do. 

How can I talk to Rose when she comes to me about these issues? I don't know how to handle her situations and complaints when I agree with management most of the time.

27103,Non-Romantic,38yxpk,"I've had an eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Looking at pictures from my childhood, I was clearly bordering on underweight, but I thought I was obese. When I was ten, I started dieting, which quickly turned into binge eating every day. 

I thought I just had terrible self control until I was fifteen and googled Why can't I stop eating? and a website about binge eating disorder came up. After realizing that I had all the symptoms, I was in denial, and decided to compensate for the weight I had gained (it was only about five pounds, but I thought it was much, much more) by starving myself - which made the binges become larger and larger. I thought I could get back to normal without anyone ever finding out. 

I know that what I am doing is extremely unhealthy. I've stopped restricting calories, but the binges haven't gotten any better and I continue to gain weight, which has destroyed my self-esteem. I try to eat healthy, but binge on so much junk food that I am likely putting myself at risk for diabetes and countless other diseases. Most days, I end up binge eating 3000 + calories.

I'm pretty sure I have read every self help book for binge eating/bulimia out there, as well as watching documentaries, trying Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, journaling, etc. It's starting to become clear to me that I won't be able to fix this on my own...I need help. 

The problem is my family. My father had an affair last summer, and my parents are divorcing within the next couple months, which has been devastating to my mom. On top of that, last year I was diagnosed with social anxiety and depression. My mom was extremely hurt that I had hid this from her for so long, and felt guilty that she hadn't realized sooner. I received treatment for this, and even though it was completely unhelpful, I convinced my mom everything was fine now (her constant worrying was making my anxiety even worse). 

If I tell my mom now, it will make her already difficult life so much harder. The divorce is putting a strain on our finances, and paying for therapy is the last thing she needs. We live in a small town with very few mental health resources (the psychologist I saw was the only one here), so we would have to travel at least three hours to the closest city. Another concern I have about telling my mom is the guilt she will feel - I suspect that the reason I started restricting calories in the first place was that she was constantly worrying about her weight and talking about dieting in front of me. I also believe she will feel a sense of betrayal; I have lied on a daily basis about food that went missing, meals I skipped, and my frequent health problems. 

On the other hand, if I wait until I leave for university in the fall, I will still be financially dependant on my parents (I have scholarships which cover the tuition, but they are paying for my dorm room and meal plan). I will be moving far away from home to an unfamiliar city, with the added stress of studying and trying to make friends. I have no idea how to find help or if I even will be able to as I will not be eighteen yet. If I were to get help, I also wouldn't know whether or not to tell my parents - if I did, they would worry, but if I didn't and they found out, I think it would make them feel as if I didn't trust them. 

I'm so conflicted. I apologize for the length of this, and if you read it all, thank you. 

TL;DR - I have binge eating disorder and don't know if I should tell my family/what my other options are.

27138,Non-Romantic,2wz2wb,"I moved in with my two roommates over half a year ago. We have all been friends since middle school, with about the same maturity level, the same interests, and two of us (me included) had lived with our parents our entire lives. Since then, I've made plans to go back to secondary school and further my education. I've also entered a serious relationship and made other positive lifestyle changes. I feel like I've started to grown up, but they haven't yet.


Neither of them have girlfriends. One is a capable bachelor, the other is a bit more hopeless with women, but they both like having parties at our house (with copious amounts of young girls). I'm not into having parties but I don't feel like I can deny them if they want to. However, after a party they had a couple months ago, I had to lay down some ground rules. They threw a party when they knew I had to work early the next morning, they let people invite friends of friends so a ton of shady people showed up that none of us even knew, they invited mostly under aged people, and they let people go upstairs, where all our bedrooms are which we agreed upon not doing. On three separate occasions drunk people came into my room while I was in bed. A lot of other fucked up shit happened but long story short, it was out of hand, and I talked to them about it. We agreed on no more friends of friends, no more under aged people, and no more parties when someone has to work the next morning.


That brings me to this weekend's party. It's the first party since our rules were established and it's one of my roommate's birthdays. I don't wanna be a downer because it's his birthday, and for the most part they've followed the rules so far (we'll see if a lot of friends of friends show up). However, when I looked at the facebook invite list, it's all under aged girls that accepted. The party is in a few days. What should I do about this? I don't like having under aged people, especially girls in our house. It could cause unnecessary legal troubles for ourselves and damage my future career path. Thank you.

It is my grandparents' house, my uncle is paying the bills while my mom helps out around the house. Me and my brother got an opportunity to do labor work at my dad's camp, so we have been doing that almost every day this summer.

At first, my brother and I started to butt heads because we never got time away from each other. Then we got into a fist fight a few weeks into June because he was drunk, telling me what I need to do with my life. All while we're sharing my full sized bed every night. About a week later, we forgave each other but he started staying at my dad's camp at night instead of sleeping in my room. 

At 4 in the morning on Friday he ran over a mailbox, called my mom and proceeded to say the most hateful things to her over and over for hours. By the end of it, she wasn't reading his texts because they were coming in so fast. She hadn't done anything to him, and it's apparent he wasn't drinking because police showed up when he hit the mailbox.

Over the weekend, he came to visit and apologize to my mom. It went well and seemed like we were back to normal, even though I was reluctant. 

Today, my mom was on the phone with him, talking about my depression (not clinical, I just told her I felt depressed). For some reason my brother told my mom that I smoked pot yesterday, then starting backing down saying he was lying.

Of course my mom told me he said that, and I confronted him.

He immediately went back to the way he was the other night, going after my mom like they were sworn enemies. He showed up at the house, told my grandparents/uncle that I smoke pot and that my mom is an alcoholic in order to try to get us kicked out of the house.

I really love my best friend. She's helped me alot in the past year with personal issues and she's helped me get past past issues that i've had years prior. Before we got as close as we are now, I had some what of a forced crush on her. 

Let me explain, when I first met her. I liked her personality, she liked alot of things I liked and really wanted to be with her. After certain events, I told her about it and after said events, told her I don't feel that for her anymore... But now that we've gotten closer and I've allowed this friendship to grow beautifully, I find myself developing these feelings of wanting to be with her again. 

However, like anything I think about (doesn't help anxiety mixes into this), I feel like a relationship between us would never work as I would like it. I'm too proud to admit I'm wrong sometimes and she's too stubborn sometimes. Plus, I'm like a hopeless romantic and (from my knowledge) she isn't really romantic at all.  So, I'd feel like I'm trying to be too romantic and she would just be repulsed by it. (We have also been told by multiple friends of ours that we seem to fight like an old married couple sometimes which may or may not be a bad thing.)There is also the fact that she is abstinent and I'm not really sexually attracted to her (not that I don't find her attractive &gt;.&gt; she is plenty cute).

27176,Non-Romantic,38ymko,"Hi /r/relationships. I'm having a friend problem and need some help. 

The friend I am speaking of and I have been friends for four years. Several years ago she wanted to lose her virginity and had unprotected sex with someone she had known for a while. She knew he slept around, yet continued to have unprotected sex (no condoms OR birth control) with him despite common sense and concern from all her friends. I lost a lot of respect for her for her dumb and reckless behavior. She had a pregnancy scare, and luckily only ended up getting HPV from him and nothing worse. Of course, I was there to support her through the pregnancy scare and comfort her when she cried and complained about getting HPV. We were roommates, and she was part of our friend group, so I couldn't just stop being friends with her because it would be awkward and create tension within the group.

Since then, she was in a serious relationship which ended a few months ago, and she was devastated. She is trying to get over her ex and is on the rebound. She is now back with her first fuck buddy, the one who gave her HPV, and despite promising me that she would be safe this time, is *again* not using condoms (although this time she is thankfully on the pill, so no pregnancy scares). She has not asked to have him get tested and does not know what he has, yet is still making the dumb decision to not use condoms with a person who already gave her one STD! She also broke her promise to me. I am angry, disgusted, and fed up. How could she be so stupid? How could she make the exact same mistake again??

I want to distance myself and not really be friends anymore. I don't want to be friends with someone who makes such reckless decisions, and I don't want to have to pick up the pieces again if she gets another STD despite all of her friends' warnings. We were close, so this makes me sad, but I am just too angry to be friends with her after this. We were talking the other day and she was so excited to be plan a bachelorette party for me. She is also in my friend group, so I won't be able to avoid her. 

How can I distance myself without making it awkward for my friends? How do I stop being friends with her if I can't avoid her?

I also don't feel like I can ask her to not plan my bachelorette party when she was so excited to do it.

Recently we moved into a small office together. I knew she had a few friends that she chats with during the day on gchat, but I had no idea how much time she spends doing this. She honestly has like 3 or 4 ongoing conversations with friends going all day every day and almost every time I look over to her computer when she's feverishly typing, it's in one of these chat windows, not work.  

My problem with this is that she constantly talks about how swamped she is with work. Honestly I don't even think she realizes how much time she spends chatting with her friends during the day and how bad that is for productivity. It's one thing to go on reddit for like 15 minutes every couple hours, but it's another to allow yourself to be pulled from work every couple minutes all day.

I tried to kind of mention something about it once and she was all like hey you can't talk, etc because she knows I get distracted from work a lot too since it's something we used to chat about before we shared an office. I don't know how to express to her from a coworker and manager's standpoint that what's she's doing is to the detriment of her productivity and to the company.

In addition, she also doesn't hear 75% of what I say to her when she's chatting with her friends.

27194,Non-Romantic,28cn4q,"My parent's are moving and so they stopped by my and my husbands house to stay the night. My mother brought a lot of old boxes containing random papers, pictures, childhood toys and memories. She asked me to go through them and see what I wanted to keep. Well, tonight, after they left, my husband and I decided to take a look and now I wish we hadn't.

My husband came across a few old pictures of my mother with another man. It was obvious it was when she was young and before she met my father. My husband asked who the man in the picture was and I thought about it and was all, Oh, I think that's my mother's first love! He's basically the one that got away. She *never* got over him. Now, I had never seen him before but knew this had to be him. Let's call him Antonio. Him and my mother are both Mexican while my father is white. Anyway, my mother once found a cute picture of an ex of my father's (who was Japanese and the picture was a stylish photo of her in a kimono) and my mother threw a shit fit (so the story goes). She said there was no place for old pictures of exes in a marriage etc etc and how it's *wrong*. There's no way my mother, who is virtuous, would keep a photo of an ex unless it was Antonio. And the pictures were modest but very personal. This had to be Antonio.

I thought it was interesting and took a picture to send to my sister for confirmation. As I was sending it, things started to click. This man looks very much like my brother. Holy hell. In fact, now that I *really* think about it, my brother looks *nothing* like my dad or my dad's side of the family. I just always thought it was because he took after my mother's side more. But this would explain so much!! It explains why:

* My brother has always looked more full Mexican than me or my sister
* My mother has always kind of overly adored my brother. He's incredibly special to her. Mare than what seems normal.
* My brother and father never seemed to click or have *anything* in common.
* A few years ago my father had an affair and my mother was a little quick to forgive him, especially since it's not an amazing happy love she's ready to try to fight for. There's never been much chemistry between my parents.

And the more I study the pictures, the more the truth is undeniable. If you cover up the top half of his face, the bottom half looks exactly like my brother's. In one photo, they have a similar posture and their arms (of all things) are exactly alike! And he's very tall. My brothers is much taller than my father and my sister and I are short.

If he is my brother's biological father, it means my mother would have had an affair with him three years after my parents were married. This is turning my entire world upside down!! I feel like everything I know is wrong. Everything I thought I knew about my mother, who has always seemed like a saint, is *wrong*!! This even changes how I feel about and see my father! This goes against everything my mother taught me. And she let us see my father as the bad guy and like a horrible monster for having an affair... when she's *just as* if not *more* guilty than he is! I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should confront my mom, squeeze it out of her, tell my brother or what. Unfortunately Antonio passed away about 8 years ago. I remember very well. My mother was inconsolable and extremely heartbroken. This secret would no doubt destroy my parents marriage and my brother, if they don't know already. I hate this.

One thing I know for sure is that my brother is my brother, always and forever. Nothing can change my love for him.



---   
**tl;dr**: My mother had an affair which resulted in my brother and it's been a secret for nearly 30 years until I found his bio dad's picture and saw the undeniable evidence that he's his dad. Not sure where to go from here with this life changing/destroying secret.

**Edit**: I understand a lot of the skepticism some of you seem to have. But all the pieces fit and it explains so much. Much more than I was able to write down. Yes, I know it's not *fact* till my mother or a DNA test confirms it, but *everything* points to her being guilty. And so you all can better understand why I am so convinced here is more evidence for you to mull over:

* Saying she never got over Antonio is an understatement
* My father was in the military and was gone a lot of the time
* My father missed my sisters birth because of work, but this hurt my mother and she talks about how lonely she felt
* My mother has admitted to being naive when she was young and that she didn't realize she could get pregnant so soon after having my sister. My brother and sister are not even a year apart.
* My mother claims my brother was almost 10 months gestation. Nine months and 3 weeks, according to her.
* My parent's only dated 3 months before marrying because my father knocked her up and she didn't want her family knowing. She was pregnant with twins but lost them 7 months into it.

A lot of explainable/hard to explain things seem to be explained by this, such as:

* My dad's side of the family looks down on my mother, something my mother always claimed was because they were racist. But they never seemed racist to me. What if it's because they suspect, as I do?
* My brother has looks and personality that  doesn't seem to match either side of the family

I can see how my mother, feeling lonely and let down by a marriage she didn't want or expect to end up in, would see her one true love just to feel loved again. When she lost her twins, my father was not supportive or understanding. He's never really been an understanding kind of man. He can be a bit cold. My mother was a hopeless romantic and was *terribly* let down by their marriage. But she was raised catholic and, to this day, does not believe in birth control or divorce. Maybe she just wanted to see her lost love and one thing led to another... I don't know. I love my mother and I have always respected and looked up to her. *She* was the one who raised me to be moral, genuine and honest. A fact of which almost feels like a joke at the moment. *Everything* adds up. If my father turns out to be my brother's biological father, this would be a *the single* biggest coincidence I have *ever* heard of. I need to know but I don't want to know. I'm scared of the truth but scared of not knowing either. And right now is **the worst** time for this to happen. I am four months pregnant with my first and my parents' first grandchild.

UGH. This sounds like some twisted plot to a soap opera. And I can't describe how much I wish it were. But this is really happening and I *really* don't know how to handle this. No solution seems possible.

**Edit 2**: I apologize for freaking out on some of you. This is *extremely* difficult to deal with and it has me on an emotional roller coaster I haven't felt since puberty. I hope Reddit can be a little understanding at how this is effecting me. I *love* my family and want what's best for them. I don't want revenge as someone has suggested. The last thing I want is for my family to hurt. And I don't have this sick need to be right, either. In fact, I hope I am horribly wrong and that I can forget this whole thing ever happened.

I think I've reached a decision. I will not have peace of mind until I know the truth. DNA evidence is not possible in the near future so I'll have to ask my mother. My mother loves me very much and her and I have always been close. Not super close, but close enough to where I can ask her hard questions. I'll ask her, if she is able to make it down this weekend. If I'm wrong, she'll likely just laugh it off and blame it on my wild imagination. If I'm right, and God I really hope I'm not, then we'll just have to go from there.

Also, for the record, I was looking for advice more specific to how it effects me. Not about how to tell my brother or some such but how I'm supposed to keep from losing it.

*Final edit, I hope*: In simple terms. **Fact** My brother does not look like my father, a man my mother has never particularly loved. **Fact** My brother looks like my mother's ex, a man my mother will love with all her heart until the day she dies.

**Actual final edit**: I'm done here. I came looking for genuine advice on a difficult subject. There's a bunch of accusations being flung around from me craving drama, wanting revenge, the need to be right and basically treating me like I want to destroy my family.

Steve's my best friend, and Sammy is a good old friend of mine. I would think I love them together, but they are.both so different and fake when they're together!

27213,Non-Romantic,2ooixl,"So my roommates and I are all very close. We've known each other for a long time before we were roommates and we've had an almost perfect living situation together. My roommate S and B were friends growing up so they're closer than I am, but we're all pretty close at this point.

A usual night is just kicking back after a day of working, occasionally smoking some pot or drinking, but never anything too crazy. I used to do a lot of drugs so now I pretty much avoiding any kind of partying or hanging around people who do use, I don't have a problem with people who do, I just end up doing things I later regret. 

The one problem that I have about S, if any, is that he's too nice. He wants to help out any person that he can in whatever way he can. He's the nicest and most caring person I've ever met. He's helped me out more than anyone ever has and he does that for pretty much everyone, but some people take advantage of that... He gives everyone the benefit of the doubt.

So last night... 

S goes out at night, comes back in a rush telling B that he's gotta give some girl a ride, that she'll only be here a night, that he's sorry, it's ok, he'll be back B doesn't really respond... I come out of my room and hear all this from B. I call and text S and get no response. B and I don't want someone staying here that we don't know... Our neighborhood isn't the greatest so we're a little protective over our house.

S comes back, someone's boots are on the ground and our shower's being used. Starts telling me she's only gonna be here for one night, it's chill. She's a smack head (heroin addict), she's homeless, S met her less than 3 hours ago walking around our not so great neighborhood. They stayed up talking for a long time, I went to sleep. B told me this morning he couldn't go to sleep because they were making too much noise from S's bedroom...

I'm gonna go ahead and say I'm being way too passive. I don't know or want this person in our home, she's still in her home. Both B and I want her out. We don't want our shit stolen. It's not that I assume any person who'd stay over would steal our shit, but I've done smack, I've hung around people who do it. It's expensive, people are willing to do some shady shit to get it. 

We'd discussed it beforehand that we didn't want random people we didn't know staying here... And I thought it was a given that he'd at least ask or talk to us about it for a second before she was already showering in our house. I want S as our roommate still. Other than this one event, our rooming situation has been really nice... but what the hell. I'm in shock.

She moved away and went through a suicidal period of time and I helped her through that, and since then she's been pretty dependent on me as a friend. 

However, she's consistently displayed erratic behavior. She enjoys bragging to me about her sexual conquests in lurid detail and the things that guys say to her (that she's the best lay they've ever had, she's so hot etc) which I'm uncomfortable about. I'm generally conflict-avoidant though so I haven't openly told her about that, but I change the topic if she brings it up. 

A couple of times she has insinuated that I am less sexually attractive than her. One time it was in front of my boyfriend, who defended me and said something like he disagreed, and she laughed in his face and told him we were all adults and he didn't have to lie to make me feel better. It was very hurtful, especially because she's aware that I'm pretty insecure about my sexual attractiveness.

Apart from that, she often fixates upon her personal idea of herself as a special snowflake. She will tell me about men who compliment her and say she is the most interesting, wild, sexy, fun, independent, smart girl they have ever met etc. While I get that she wants to share these things, it gets repetitive when I hear it every week. Other times, she will tell me that she is a worthless person who nobody will love, and I will have to reassure her that that isn't the case. 

Some background: she was bullied/mocked quite a bit throughout middle and high school, so I think that's affected her. I know this, so I try to keep an open mind and have more sympathy for her. At the same time, it's been getting a bit annoying for me. I don't exactly want to cut her out of my life because as I mentioned she doesn't really have any other friends and I feel bad. I've made hints that she may want to get therapy but she always brushes it off.

My sister got pregnant when we stared our business, quit her job to become part of it - realizing that her other job wasn't conducive for raising a family (why? it's beyond me) I think she saw it as a way out of the 9-5 even though she has no true interest in what we do for a living. She doesn't really contribute and I find her a detriment to my everyday work life because she tells me she wants to work, and I get stuck with the baby but she doesn't work efficiently to make it worth while. Something that would take me a few hours takes her days. 

My sister and brother in law are snobs with not a lot money, in a sense. In the first year my nephew has been alive I have babysat for them on 5 different occasions so they can go on vacation and have a break, their vacations ranged in lasting 3-5 days. This year they have gone on one week long vacation. 

Now, with Christmas coming up my boyfriend and I are looking to go on a little 4 day long weekend in the middle of December and mentioned it to my sister the other day. She said they planned to go on a 5 day cruise, then weekend before Christmas is their anniversary and said they were planning on going away again. My boyfriend found that to be rather excessive and said we didn't have any interest on doing a cruise with them, so we are going away on our own. She as a matter a fact-ly replied Well, whitegirlanswer is babysitting if you guys go or not.. 

We had a long talk about it and it seems my sister has been taking advantage of me and my babysitting because we work together and our schedule is extremely flexible and then tells me if it were me with a baby she would do it for me but fact of matter is my boyfriend basically said if we had kids would I ask his sister who works full time to drop everything for 5 days so we can go on vacation and when he put it like that I felt very taken advantage of. 

Now I'm not sure what to think, I know I would never put that on someone else. Also, my mother is ill with Alzheimer's and my dad finds it difficult for them to look after the baby more than a few hours, so that's not an option. I suggested hiring a babysitter, but they can't afford one for that long. How much is asking too much with family? What's your opinion?

27247,Non-Romantic,1ua7l0,"So it's just me and mom living together. She divorced my dad when I was in grade 4. My sister is gone to university and only comes on holidays.

The first time I got kicked out was because I smoked weed and they found out I stole a lot of money from them for weed. I bought an ounce from selling her car parts (they were delivered to the wrong house she never bothered returning them and she also tried selling them before I did). 

Anyways that was two years ago. She made me move out and go to my dads for all of the summer and until around December I moved back in because she got a puppy and wanted me to come back. 

I moved back in everything was okay for that year no major fights. She started smoking weed with me and I eventually got bored of it and quit.

I then started talking to this girl I went out with in 8th grade. We started talking again and I really liked her. She had a dog and we were gonna have a doggy date. Right before the day she came my I finally convinced my mom to get me a German shepherd puppy after months of begging. 

So we got her the girl came over almost everyday that week she met my mom things got pretty serious. I started sneaking into her house at night so we could see each other. My mom found out and called her mom and set up a meeting. I didn't know about it.

She came over and as soon as I saw her I snuck out the backdoor and ran. I panicked. She brought my girlfriend (her daughter) over with her too. Well I came back my mom was pissed and screaming at me blah ok this is long. 

Anyways her mom and my mom got into a fight, my mom took my girlfriend and i to a concert she wasn't allowed to go to. My girlfriend got kicked out of her house and moved into mine, things were ok. One day she got mad and said we couldn't sleep together anymore and made me sleep in my sisters room.(who was in uni) I did that for a bit but then I started sleeping with my girlfriend and sneaking out to my sisters room right before my mom woke up. We started skipping school alot. I probably missed almost 2 months of school already. My mom never got mad she never said much really. I started smoking cigs. My mom even bought them for me without me asking when I ran out.

Next thing I know. Me and my girlfriend go to a new years party at a friends of mine. After it ended we started walking toward the bus stop when my dad called me and asked if we wanted him to pick us up. We said yes and told him to go to the bus stop. (where we thought we were going.) turns out we were on the completely wrong street and we got lost for an hour. My phone died no way to contact anyone. A cab pulled up and we asked him to take me home.

I get home my mom won't let us in. It is freezing by the way, we are in Toronto. I couldn't feel anything and I was shaking so bad. My sister (who came back for the break) finally came and my mom freaked out and started screaming at us for skipping school and smoking cigs. (which she never really talked about before). She was mad because my dad was out there looking for us. She took my smokes and told my starting tomorrow we have a bed time and I have to wake up at 5 to walk my dog and started treating me like a baby. She hit me and I tried pushing her and everyone pulled me away but I guess I ripped her shirt.

Next morning, she says the same thing but now me and my girlfriend have to take turns sleeping on the couch. She stopped caring about me and my girlfriend sleeping together a while ago and I thought it was dumb. She is very inconsistent and I believe she may have an underlying mental illness.

I got pissed and me, my girlfriend, and my dog left and stayed at an abbandoned house for a bit. My dog was getting cold so I quickly took her back and put her in the backyard through the side door. I knew my mom would see her.

We went to McDonald's after to warm up now that my dog wasn't with us. Thn my mom starts messaging me. Give me my house key and take your dog. She then tElls me I'm not taking care of your dog and I'm throwing her out. My sister gets the same message and rushes home from my dads place. My dog was tied up to the front porch in the cold.

My dad gets me and my girlfriend from McDonald's and brings us to his place. (with my dog). My girlfriends mom took her back home. But now my mom won't let me or my dog come back home. She won't even talk to me, she said she doesn't want anything to do with me. She won't give me my clothes my computer or anything. My sister and dad tried reasoning with her and she won't listen.

Back in March, my boyfriend,  his sister and I were all hanging out and having a good time.  His sister (who I'll name Annie) brought up this band that we all like and that they have both seen in concert multiple times. I have never seen them,  but have always really wanted to.  She looks up to see if they have a show coming up and they do,  in August.  She asks if they can go,  and I mention I'd love to see them.  He responds with Alright I'll get tickets later for us, not acknowledging me but looking directly at Annie. 

So I was upset because I did not feel included and had mentioned multiple times to him prior to this night that I really wanted to see them.  I brought it up a couple weeks later when we were alone and he ended up telling me he was going to surprise me but he got me a ticket aswell. I was super excited.  I took the weekend of the concert off from work and bragged to my coworkers.  Needless to say, I was pumped. 

Flash forward to last week. The tickets haven't come in the mail like they were supposed to so my boyfriend calls the company he ordered from.  Turns out the order didn't go through and that there were tickets no longer available.  Oh well, we're all pretty bummed, but we'll get over it because it was a silly mistake. 

Well, today I'm going through my twitter feed when I notice my boyfriend's sister posted to someone about going to the concert this weekend. I thought it was strange but got my hopes up a little and went to ask my boyfriend about it. He looks at me and goes Oh that's right. I was talking to a coworker earlier about the whole situation and he says he has tickets for it but he can't use them so he gave them to me. I told Annie I would take her.

I immediately turned around and walked away. I was and am still livid and upset. I haven't spoken to him since and am currently lying in bed while he sleeps. I'm more hurt than anything, because he knew how excited I was, and that he didn't tell me. That I didn't get the option of going. He just decided to take his sister and leave me alone all weekend.  

So I guess I'm wondering whether it's okay to be upset. I don't want to be the bad guy, and I truly likejo Annie, but I think was my boyfriend did was an asshole move. How do I approach this?

Update:
We spoke for a little bit before he went to work, and he says he didn't think I could go because I had to work (even though I took it off). He understands why I feel the way I do, and agrees he pulled a dickish move. As of now he is looking to get another ticket for Saturday but understands that does not fix the overall issue of lack of communication.  We will speak later tonight.

At some point a few months ago, I seem to have struck up a friendship with one of the guys I work with, who works in a different location than I do. We've met on multiple occasions and have friends in common. We've got a lot of interests in common, almost to a freaky degree, and have been talking for hours on end about everything under the sun, even outside work hours and on the weekend. He's a super sweet guy, self-described as socially awkward, and wow, at some point I seem to have fallen for him pretty hard.

Cue this weekend. He's alluded many times to having a crush at work. Stupidly, I thought it was me. We talk all the time, right? We have so much in common. Somehow we started joking about bdsm, and he started calling me mistress. There's no way that's ambiguous, I thought. He's clearly flirting with me.

Later in the day, he mentions his work crush again, and that it's someone who works on the other side of the office. Punch to the gut. Sudden, intense pang of jealousy. He randomly asked how I'm doing, and it took a long time for me to answer.

This is where I should have shut up, but I confessed to having a crush on him, and that I should probably take a step back and talk to him a little less. No reaction. Nothing. No I'm really flattered, but you're not my type. I'm left thinking wow, how grossed out must he be that he couldn't even say something. Anything. The reaction itself has left me more devastated than the fact that he has a thing for someone he admits he has nothing in common with.

Today we talked briefly and I tried to keep it chill, but explained that I really need him not to flirt with me, and that joking about sex and calling me mistress really sent the wrong signal. He said he didn't see it that way, and that I should tell him if he's doing something that comes across as flirtation again.

Should I even try to continue to be friends with him? I'm hurt, but I know once I get over that, I'll miss his friendship terribly. On the other hand, not even any reaction, no reassurance, no thanks, I'm flattered. Maybe the friendship means nothing to him. But if that were the case, why would we talk for upwards of ten hours a week? Why would he waste so much time on me?

27285,Non-Romantic,2qde47,"Sorry for the long text post on Christmas Day, I just hope someone can offer a little advice about how to broach this topic – if at all. I just left home this September for university and before anyone interjects that I'm a horrid ungrateful daughter I'm honestly not, I really appreciate the effort she always goes to, this day and every day, with our family (my parents are together but she takes care of the gift buying) but I find myself a bit upset by her gifting this year. Let me explain.

Firstly, she gave me a sweater that I specifically picked out, which is great and I obviously have no problem with. However, she has given me sweets and chocolate (I am dieting so as not to gain weight at university and I’ve recently joined a gym), she has given me rum (I’ve frequently mentioned how spirits make me feel ill and I only drink beer and wine), she has given me a candle (which she knows are banned in university halls of residence), and she has given me an ornament (which I already have and showed her when I bought it).

All these things I have told her either in person or on the phone home.

My issue here and the reason I am upset is that she is fully aware I have a history of severe anxiety over my financial situation, which has only been worsened by independent living (my rent/food/transport is disproportionately high through being in an expensive city) – so this is why I had a conversation with her nearly a month ago about Christmas. She said she hadn’t bought me anything yet apart from the sweater and I said that was perfect because I only wanted/needed money. She said that was fine and she wouldn’t buy me anything else. 

This is not me being ungrateful for her efforts, but I feel completely ignored and upset. We don’t have any extended family who wouldn’t care about giving an ‘impersonal’ gift of money so my she was the only person I could ask for this. And it’s honestly not me wanting impersonal handouts and not caring about gift-giving, but in my current situation money was the best gift she could possibly have given me. I also hate waste of any kind and I know that lots of this is going to get donated or regifted. 

I obviously can’t bring this up on Christmas day without really upsetting her, but she’s completely ignored my anxieties and request (that she agreed to) and apparently not listened when I talk to her about other things. 

Should I talk to my Dad and ask him to speak privately to her? Or shall I tell him to just tell her when my birthday/next Christmas roll around that the best gift she could give me really is just money? Or do I just not say anything and mention it to her before the next event myself? Or never say anything at all and take this as a hint?

TL;DR – mother accepted then ignored my request for no presents just money and the presents she has got me are completely inappropriate for me and make me feel like she hasn’t listened to a word I’ve said since I moved away.","My (18F) mother (56F) has got me Christmas gifts that show she doesn't listen to me, and I'm a bit upset",0.0,False,0.0,9.0,1419525252.0,/r/relationships/comments/2qde47/my_18f_mother_56f_has_got_me_christmas_gifts_that/,NonRomantic

My friend (let's call her Natasha) and I have been close for about 5 years now. She and I began by dating through the last two years of high school, and eventually called it quits when she cheated on me at prom. After that, we went NC for 5 months, and during that time, I found out she had been seeing my oldest friend, who now is no longer my friend. Eventually it ended and then I decided to reach out to her. 

At first she was a very angry person towards me, mostly because when we broke up she tried clinging to my friends for support, and they were having none of it, so she ended up very alone. It took a while, but eventually we started being friends, although the attraction was still there. 

Fast forward 3 months and we secretly started seeing each other again. This went on for a while until I went away for the military, and eventually she cheated on me again (I know, fool me once... Etc.) So we went NC again. 

Another 6 months go by and she reached out this time. She missed my friendship, so I figured there was no harm if we were strictly friends. We got close, hung out alllll the damn time, and became the best of friends. Things were awesome, and the romance just wasn't there, so I felt comfortable in how things were. 

About 5 months into that, she got a new boyfriend and dropped off the face of the earth. I was working fulltime, so it took me a little while to realize she had blocked me on social media, but I was indeed shocked when I found out. 

I wasn't as upset this time, as she really hadnt done anything hurtfull, and I understand that an ex bf can be touchy for a new boyfriend. 

6 months go by, and I've nearly forgotten about her altogether. One evening while I was rocking some piece and quiet I got a fb message. It was her, and she wanted to talk. It turns out (from her story) that her bf had blocked me and that's why she hadn't spoken to me. Obviously I didn't believe it, but she wanted to make it up to me and rekindle the friendship. I started hanging with her for a while and it's as if things clicked. Best friendship ever. We were there for each other through thick and thin. My car broke down, and she was there. She ended up drunk downtown without a ride home, and I got her back. It was really good for me to have someone I could rely on. 

We've been friends since, and I had no complaints about her at all. But for about a month things have taken a strange turn. She fucked a guy on new years, and they started dating (good for her, she's been single for a while now). Nowadays she very rarely returns my texts, she gets defensive when I call her on it, and she seems not to care about how I'm doing. It feels like she's slipping away, but she's a really important person to me (so is her family, they are like my second family) and I don't want to lose her again. 

All cards on the table: I''ve been depressed recently, and it's possible I'm just being weird. 

TL;DR - Have a long complicated friendship with my ex girlfriend, and shit's been fucky recently.

So anyways, as you know I was questioning if this was right or not. Who better to ask than the source right?

So we hung out the other day and we were watching a movie. I kinda stayed on the other end of the couch for most of it. Well halfway through the movie she slides over and curls up next to me, so I do the same. Then I asked her So, are you okay with me kissing you on the forehead? You didn't really give me a clear answer.

Yeah, totally okay with it. was her response. Then I had to ask the obvious question. What does your boyfriend think about it? I assume he doesn't know, and if he doesn't what do you think he would say about it?

Her response worried me. Well, I'm okay with it and thats all that really matters right? I dont think he would be too happy with it. But I think that it could just be our little secret. She said with a laugh and a smile.

She went back to watching the movie. I cant even remember the rest of it because that sentence hung in my mind for the rest of the night.

So I am pretty sure I am going to have to cut things off with her completely. Which is gonna totally suck because I do love her (In a strictly platonic way) And she loves me (Same way). But this it gonna be for the best. I know it

tl;dr She is okay with it. Wants to keep it a secret from her bf

Edit: I do love her, you guys helped me notice this. I am in love with her in more than a friendly way. I dream about her every night, and she is constantly on my mind. I can't ever stop thinking about her. She is so pretty and smart and funny and such an individual. She is so great. I feel like a jackass now since I spent all this time saying I didn't feel this way. It just pains me that I cant be with her. But that is my own fault. I fell for her knowing what would happen.

27312,Non-Romantic,1uvtj9,"I (28F) am a receptionist. I am a well-educated, polite woman with a college degree. The job market isn’t exactly prosperous right now in my field. (I feel this is important to mention as I do not have this job because it is all I am capable of being in life.)

We have a new employee (36M) that for the purpose of this post, I will refer to as ‘G.’ He is a salesmen, and he REEKS of it. He is extremely pushy, and has over stepped his boundaries several times in the first five days of being here. (Installing software on all of the computers without consulting the boss, instating new rules that aren’t his to instate, etc.) 
Anyway, he has everyone else convinced that he is the nicest guy ever. (Salesmen.) When he is rude or condescending to me, he does it in a seemingly polite and innocent way. Example: He made me carry a box out to his car because he only wanted to make one trip. Instead of asking any of the men that work in the office, he asked me, a 5’7 130lb woman to get it. He then proceeds to follow me back inside. He knew he was going to be coming back inside, but made me stop what I was doing to help him. As we were walking out, one of my female co-workers asked him: “Couldn’t you get one of the guys to do that?” He replies with: “Someone has to give her work to do. Don’t worry about her.” Although the box wasn't super heavy, he did not need me to carry it out. 

He was not joking, but said it in a joking manner. (He’s super passive aggressive, which is a trait I personally abhor in people.)  This is just one of the many examples of the way he speaks to me/treats me. (And this is only in the first five days…) He seems to enjoy making me do trivial task because he can. He will ask me to print things for him out of his folder. (He has asked me to do this while he had the document he needed printed pulled up on his screen before.) 
I wasn’t crazy about him from day one, but I am a very professional individual. I am always polite and helpful when I can be. It is not my place to let my personal feelings interfere with my work relationships. I almost always stop what I am doing to help others out. I am busy, mind you, but sometimes, my work isn’t as pressing, so I don’t mind helping out. (Mind you, though not pressing, it is still work, and still needs to be done.) 

Here in lies the dilemma. 

1.) We are a small company, and we don’t have an H.R. department. I am actually being trained to be head of HR as we speak, but with how flakey they are around here, I am holding my breath on that ever happening.  Once promoted, I wouldn’t be at his every beckon call, but that is months away, if that even happens at all. 

2.) I know if I say anything, he will push the blame on me, explain that he was ‘Just joking’ and that I am too sensitive. 

3.) No one else sees it. My one lady co-worker that did said she isn’t going to say anything because she thinks it won’t make any difference.

4.) He is so manipulative, I have a feeling he will eventually paint me in a bad light and everyone will be on his side. (Even though I have been here for almost a year.) 

I guess I am asking: How can I deal with this? How can I be the better person without crying at my desk every day? How can I protect myself from his potential lies/manipulations? I actually cried at my desk this morning because I feel so stuck and helpless. I want to wait until I have been here for at least a year or so before seeking new employment. (A year’s worth of experience can potentially open up the doors for more prominent positions like office management or higher pay in my current position. ) 
Any insight is appreciated.

I'm not sure how to let her know she's appreciated because the ways that I've done it, doesn't seem to be enough.  I pay her for gas money on a weekly basis.  I say thank you every single day in the morning and afternoon.  I offer to help out around the house but she always says no or that she's already done everything.  If not those comments in particular, then she'll say that I should be able to know what to do without asking or being told (even though that's something that I struggle with).  I've also offered to drive myself to work but they don't want me doing that and I also don't feel comfortable doing so anymore because of how many accidents happen during those times that we commute to my workplace and in our specific routes, whereas taking the bus can take an hour and a half..I'm trying to find her a job that's close to my workplace at least until my contract's done (5 months left).

I know that it's a tricky situation and I'm so appreciative of everything, but I can only imagine how hard everything is on her because she also deals with stress regarding her part-time job and doing manual labour, the fact that the hours are all over the place especially when we have to wake up so early in the morning, not making enough money, the fact that my siblings have all moved out around the same time and I think she expects me to do certain things that my siblings would normally do (or be a certain way that they would, my older sister in particular since that's what we call my mom's twin) and knowing that I can't fulfill that role which is frustrating (for instance, she expected me to immediately come home after my appointment yesterday so I can set the table with snacks for her friend and their family members), and I think it's a lot for her.

27318,Non-Romantic,2wmurr,"Kim and I have been friends for about 2 years now she is my best friend, we're very compatible and get along great, we rarely fight and are extremely close. 

When I first met Kim she was beautiful, she was in great shape had long black hair (imagine Pocahontas) and she could get any guy she wanted, I was kind of a loser in high school because of my weight and I suffer from depression, when I met her in University she helped me out of that ditch and I started to eat better and I'm very comfortable with myself now and I get lots of attention.

Right around the time I had my physical transformation Kim started to let herself go. She's put on around 100 pounds (she used to weigh 110), she eats constantly, always wants fast food, eats food I told her she couldn't eat at my house, and then cries and whines about how fat she is, and tries to make me feel like shit when I mention I'm going to the gym or making a healthy snack by saying I'm bringing her down but then asks for my help and advice and doesn't follow it. 

On top of the weight issue she has recently shaved her head (Demi Moore in the movie when she buzzed her head), for absolutely no reason, now when we go in public people assume we're a couple because they think she's a man where I uncomfortably say no but it seems to amuse her.

She also showers once a week now and smells absolutely awful, doesn't even brush her teeth anymore, her grades have slipped, and all she does is just complain about how much she hates her life when she never does anything to change it. 

Recently I've been talking to a guy from my job who she has met on two occasions and spoke 2 words to him, she has developed a huge crush on him, always stopping by my work whenever to bring me lunch (she doesn't have a job), and glances at his desk the whole time she's talking to me.

Before I knew about her feelings towards him I briefly mentioned that we had been texting and she flew off the handle and then acted like she wasn't mad at all and said I was being crazy for thinking she was mad. 

I decided maybe I should be a good friend and set them up! Nope, I heard him talking bad about her to one of my male co-workers talking about how they know she has a thing for him and he's grossed out. And that makes me feel awful that she's embarrassing herself.

Now this guy and I aren't in a relationship but he's pretty cute and I enjoy his company (I just got out of a long term LDR a few months ago), I love my friend but I'm sick of her acting oblivious and having such a lack of self awareness I'm just trying to protect her because I firmly believe ignorance is bliss but I don't know how to explain it to her.

I should mention that she is not very good with conflict and whenever we do have a problem she doesn't like to fix it, much less have a conversation about it, and when I have tried to put other issues on the table and talk about them like an adult, she gets extremely defensive to the point where her argument is completely laughable and a little delusional. She has also been known to have angry,explosive, fits of emotion when confronted with something she did wrong, like a toddler.

 I've listened to her and tried to be there for her as much as I could. We'd hang out,go out for drinks talk about makeup,music etc. Then she got a boyfriend and I was happy for her. Little did I know she was dayting our boss for the last 6 months.

 She would always bail on me to go hang out with him when he would text her to come over. I would listen to her talk about what an asshole he is for hours. I would tell her honestly that I don't think he's the right guy for her and she still does everything for him.

  Recently she got a big promotion at work for only being there for not even a year and I've been told I'd get a raise and promotion for the last three years and have yet to get a promotion. She's a great worker but I can't help shaking the feeling that she hasn't earned it entirely on merit.

The last words he ever said were, You don't have to ever contact me again. I hope you're happy, I'm out of your life. This is what he texted me, because he couldn't be bothered to call me on the phone.


The last conversation I had with my mom, (Deanna) I was bummed out about my boyfriend. Tried to confide in her, and she simply went on and on about how she's so in love with her new fiancee, Lisa. How they're so happy, so in love and she loves Lisa's 2 year-old daughter. Isn't Lisa's daughter perfect? Isn't she beautiful? She's my new sister, (I'm an only child) do I know that?


I hung up on her.


My dad and I have always had our issues. I was an *unplanned blessing* when my mom was 19, and my dad in his mid-20's. Deanna has told me stories of Dave hitting her with me in her arms. Or, how he threatened to take me away from her, and simply drop the subject when she'd call his bluff and hand me over.


Before, during, and even after the divorce, I was always a weapon to Dave. Sometimes it felt like Deanna did the same, keeping custody of me until I was 18, even though I moved in with Dave at 13. They would always put me in the middle, forcing me to choose between them. 


Dave got married when I was about 14/15. Instantly, New Wife was his everything. 


We had to go to church because New Wife was Lutheran, despite my dad being Atheist for much of his life. 


New Wife had pets, and even though Dave hated animals, he suddenly loved her spoiled, annoying dogs. 


She was one of those, These are my kids people. No offense to those who love their pets, but she took it to *extremes.* They would whine if they couldn't be in the same room as her, and would whine at their bedroom door ALL NIGHT LONG. Guess who had the ground-floor bedroom? Guess who slept upstairs, at the top of a long hallway and didn't have to listen to it?


New Wife is a cigarette smoker, and a drinker. My dad is a recovering alcoholic who hates cigarettes, and I have asthma. But, New Wife can smoke in the house, and so can her entirely family!


New Wife and her dogs became my dad's life. He would do nothing but post pictures on MySpace of her dogs, and soon I fell to the wayside. When her old dogs died, he bought her a new one, and that soon became the /u/Kahluka replacement.


Seriously, my dad would post about 5-10 pictures a day of the dog. He still does it, according to my cousin. He even made the dog a Facebook page, so he could post even more pictures. My mom started asking why the dog is his daughter, as that's what he would call her. He even changed his relationships on Facebook to list the dog as his kid.


So, I told him how I felt. We sat down, had some lunch. Said things would get better.


Months later, nothing has happened. I try to call, and he never answers. Text him and tell him I'm done being his kid if he doesn't want to be my dad. Long argument later, he sends me that fateful text.


My mom is a different story. She never dated when I was young, and until recently she never talked about anyone like this. At first, I was truly happy for her. Lisa is only a few years older than myself, and she hasn't come out of the closet yet, (She admits to close friends to being bi-sexual, but that's about it. To her parents, my mom is her roommate.) but she makes my mom happy. They're been together for *barely* a year, and they're already engaged.


My mom lives states and states away, but I finally got to see her after two long years this spring. She brought out Lisa and her 2 year-old, along with my grandma. I dragged along Boyfriend, who got to meet her for the first time.


Every conversation turned to Lisa. Isn't she beautiful? Isn't she amazing? I'm so happy, 'Luka. I really am. Isn't her daughter amazing? She's your new sister. Lisa's going to be like a mom to you, isn't she beautiful?


Seriously, if it wasn't about Lisa, it was about her daughter. I'd try to talk to her about something, ANYTHING, and it would all turn into, Isn't she *beautiful?*


I couldn't talk to her about my old home state, or how my life is going. I couldn't get through to her to talk about how she is, or when will she quit smoking? How about quitting drinking? Oh, Lisa's beautiful? Sure. Yeah.


Boyfriend pointed this out not too long ago. He told me that if we ever broke up, he would be afraid of what would happen to me. He told me he didn't really think anyone gave a shit about me. (Believe it or not, he said this in the nicest way possible.)


He pointed out that my mom wanted nothing to do with me, just Lisa. Did Lisa want something? Where did she want to go? Isn't she beautiful? (Seriously, every other sentence was that.)


I tried talking to her two days ago about the Boyfriend. Said I was sad, and she spouted off about Lisa. The incredible, amazing Lisa with an amazing daughter who is now also her daughter. She can do no wrong, she's never done any wrong. She can't believe she got so lucky. They set a date, did she tell me that? (She's told me nearly every conversation.)

27345,Non-Romantic,2r9ng1,"A little background:

I am the oldest of three brothers. My middle brother [23M] graduated college and is employed. My youngest brother recently left college after 3 semesters and is currently living at home, unemployed and doesn't have a clue what he wants to do. He has considered the military, as well as becoming a mechanic. He has lost a lot of weight since leaving college (280 lbs. down to 215)


My other brother is in sales and often stays at my parents' house when he is in the area (which is weekly). I live 9 hours away and only see my family rarely, but was fortunate enough to have a week off during the holidays to visit. 

My brother is quite bitter about his situation. He has no friends that he is in regular contact with, and he (apparently) can't wait to move out of the house. He is still exploring his options.

The issue that comes up is that he feels that I was somehow unfairly given an advantage in life. We were all lucky enough to have a huge amount of financial help from our parents with school, mine being more expensive than my middle brother's. My parents encouraged me to take the route I took, and even discouraged me from going to a cheaper school whose program wasn't as good. 

They however do not make it a secret that they spent a significant amount more money on me. If I had known what I rift it would cause I'd give it all back.

As a result, my youngest brother is constantly trying to bring me down, and measure himself up against me. He criticizes my salary, which is on the lower end, he loves to point out my weight, forgetting that he was much heavier than I am not 4 months ago. 

He pokes fun at my other brother because although he makes a large salary, rarely works 30 hours a week and is also heavy. 

He throws tantrums over really small things. He acts as if my brother and I are encroaching on his territory at my parents' house. He has foods that he likes, and gets upset if anyone else touches them because he doesn't like a lot of things, you guys can eat anything else He will say this about a pile of 30 mozzarella sticks that he couldn't hope to finish alone.

He uses the cost of mine and my brother's education as a bargaining chip to guilt my parents into allowing him to stay as well as to buy him things. They bought him a car while he was in college, which he justified as the difference in the cost of his education and mine was the cost of the car he wanted.

There is no talking to him about his situation. If you answer one of his insults with a comment about his situation, his response is somewhere along the line of When you were 20 you were still living off mom and dad too and then he will deflect it with a comment about my weight, my job, etc. He also has a temper, so if you eat his mozzarella sticks or drink his chocolate milk you can expect him to tear into you for being a fatass. 

90% of the time he's great. He interacts normally and helps my parents out. But the remaining time is ruining my relationship with him. We barely text/talk to each other when I am home. 

My middle brother is constantly home so their relationship is much better. He tends to ride the line with my youngest brother, and will occasionally take my side but will also egg him on for the purpose of entertainment. 

I almost feel like an outsider when I visit. It is very obvious that money is discussed when I am not home, and it seems to be that my brother is very jealous and bitter about what I was given and takes it out on me with very hurtful comments, and responds two-fold if you were ever to say anything about him. 

Its not as if he is constantly teased about his situation, it is more like he will make a comment basically daring you to say something back so he can really dig in.

 To be clear, my parents are willing to help him should he go back to school, and I have also offered to take over my parents' portion of my loan, to which they declined. It is also not as if the money they gave me is money that could have gone to him. 

I am VERY grateful for what I have been given, at the same time I am bitter about how it has affected our family.

I have tried talking to him about what he wants to do and where he wants to go, as have the rest of my family, but he doesn't show any interest in anything we bring up. Its become pretty clear that whatever he chooses will have to be HIS idea.

How do I get through to my brother and let him know I'm not a threat? How do I get him to stop making nasty, rude, unprovoked comments that really make me not want to speak to him again? 

I'm at a loss here, and with the way my life is going, I will likely be seeing my family less and less and am fearful that our relationship is strained and may soon be non-existent.

At first the kitten was allowed out to roam the common areas of our apt, but roommate would get pissed if the cat played under the couch, under the TV stand, or sniffed around stuff in the kitchen, (you know, cat things.) He started locking it in his bedroom (where the litter box is) and leaving it there for days at a time. The cat hisses at him, runs away, and is generally terrified of him. (Sidenote- I have always been kind to the cat and it will crawl into my lap and purr whenever it gets the chance.) I think he hates that the cat likes me.

He has been working/practicing for longer hours recently and locks the cat in his room. The cat claws at the floor and door to try to dig its way out, and when he gets back from work he yells at the cat for the scratches. 


Although the cat is being fed and watered, it is still being abused. He doesn't know how to handle a cat, (picks it up by its head or neck scruff even though it has gotten to big for that,) and throws it around wayyyy to roughly. He generally seems to hate the cat and is always punishing it for doing stuff that all cats do!


The last straw was recently when he got a small dog crate and has been locking it up because it peed on his carpet a few times, (when he had locked it in his tiny bedroom all day.)


I don't know what to do. I feel horrible that this cat will live with him for the rest of its life. He actively tries to keep it away from me because it likes me more than it likes him. I don't know why he got it in the first place because he just hates it so much. 

NOTE: it is an illegal cat in the apartment. He is not paying a pet fee/deposit for it, and hides it at a friend's house when we have inspections. The cat has gotten fleas and TICKS and the roommate doesn't care. I had to pick the bedroom lock and flea bath the cat/frontline it because I didn't want it to suffer and didn't want fleas in our carpet.

Do I have any options for freeing this cat from its misery? I want to offer to buy the cat and take over its care, but I can't see my stubborn roommate agreeing to that. I also want to take it to my dad's house (an hour away) and just leave the door open and say it must have gotten out. 

If i offer to buy it first and he doesn't agree, then the oh, the cat got out idea won't work, but I don't know what legal trouble I could be in if he finds out I stole the cat.

The summer of 2014 was jam packed with hanging out, walks, trips, events and the usual getting to know you type conversations. We are both single and she has had an on again/off again/just having sex only relationship with a guy for a few years. I'm trying to date in my community, but not doing so well.

I live in New England and it's been a brutal winter. I've gone to her family's home twice, invited her to a few events but since January, work has been intense, I've taken on two small part time jobs and our relationship has become tense. I don't call her as much, I hang out with other friends, or I just do things on my own(getting coffee, movies, art events) because I am quite use to being this independent and relying on me.

Last weekend, I received a very long and upset email from her stating that I never ask how her life is, call her to do one on one things, or seem to care. I'm a bit confused, a bit understanding of her point of view, and she also wrote me that she is quite done with the relationship but wanted to let me know because she felt I would never ask her. The ball is in my court. 

There is an air of neediness about her that I don't handle well. I don't have similar interests as her(she wants to get married soon, has a lot of pets, is very crafty/Pinterest-y, some shallow conversations are had...) and I feel like I have to try very hard to think of things to talk about with her. I don't know if the honeymoon phase of our friendship is over or if this is just cabin fever from being inside for most of these past three months, or the age difference, or if I am really just a bad friend to her.

27370,Non-Romantic,36l786,"I'm entering my last year of college and looking for an internship. My best friend (Tara), whom I've known for 4 years, talked to her boss (Joe) at her current internship and he wanted to hire me for the summer. This internship is all I've ever wanted and will be a great learning experience, but from what Tara has told me, I don't think it's something I want to be involved with.

Joe is young (26) and engaged to Kayla, whom I went to high school with. Joe started dating Kayla around September of last year, and proposed to her in January after finding out she was pregnant. According to Tara, Kayla comes into the office and is rude to all of the interns quite frequently.

The whole office talks about their relationship because Joe is very open about everything going on with them (which I find sort of unprofessional, but that's just my opinion). And from things I've heard from other interns that I'm friends with, they all cannot stand Kayla. I've known this girl my entire life and she is not a good person and does not come from a good family. Everyone in her family has issues, most notably her sister who is a habitual liar (faking pregnancies, illnesses for sympathy, miscarriages etc).

Joe told his fiancée that I was coming to intern for him during the summer and Kayla lost her mind. Kayla told Joe that I was the messiest person she knew, even though we have not spoken a word to each other since I was 16. We grew up in a small town, and a lot of the people there are always in drama. This is precisely why I avoid going home and have cut most of the people I went to high school with out of my life. Small town life is not for me, and I have no interest in knowing all of the gossip that goes on every day among these people I went to school with. I have moved two hours away, live in a large city, and now have a great group of ADULT friends whom I've met in college.

Tara told Joe that she's known me for four years and never once in those four years have I been messy or started drama with anyone else. She's my best friend, I'm pretty sure she knows me better than anyone else, so I'm glad that she stood up for me, but I don't know how much good that did. I'm embarrassed that my boss whom I haven't even met yet has this false impression of me. I admit, when I was 16 I was involved with some bad stuff that involved my boyfriend at the time and Kayla's sister, so I know that's what she's remembering...but that was six years ago when I was still a child.

If there is one thing I regret in life, it was that relationship and everything that came along with it. I have grown as a person, realized how toxic that whole relationship and situation was, and no longer talk to any of the people that were involved (including Kayla's sister).

So now my dilemma is that I'm having second thoughts about this internship. I loathe drama, and office drama is not something I want to deal with. Tara tells me about Joe and Kayla's relationship drama quite frequently, but it's not something I want to experience first hand...and the fact that this girl is bringing up things from six years ago is putting me off. She does not know me anymore. I am a completely different person than I was at 16. And the fact that Joe is telling his INTERN things his fiancee has told him just shows me that he's not really grown yet.

My sister told me I should still do it so that I can show Joe that the picture Kayla has painted of me is completely false, which I understand...I'm just not sure if it's worth the trouble. I feel like if I were a messy person like she claims, I would have already contacted her on social media. I am not going to say anything to her about it, but it's sort of upsetting that she is trying to sabotage a really good opportunity for me when she really doesn't know me anymore. So now I'm not sure if I should take the internship or go ahead and pass on it.

**TL;DR** A girl I went to high school with is trying to sabotage my internship at her fiancé's firm before it even begins. She told him a bunch of things about me from high school (6+ years ago) and has basically painted a completely false picture of me. Now I'm having second thoughts about taking the internship because if this type of things is happening before I even get there, no telling what will happen once I'm in the office every day...so should I avoid this internship and look for other opportunities? Or take it because it's everything I've ever wanted in an internship?

27383,Non-Romantic,2uwc3w,"So, buckle up, this is a weird fucking story.

I'm a 22 year old woman with severe Tourette's Syndrome. I live by myself, but I've lost the ability to drive more than a few miles at a time within the past month or so because of the increase in severity of my tics. My family is incredibly close...literally. We all live within 20 miles of each other, which is great, because for the most part, we all get along swimmingly.

Here's where the problem comes in.

Due to the unpredictable nature of my disorder, my tics suddenly got 100x worse around Thanksgiving. I shout and screech and scream curse words, not to mention constantly moving and twitching. It's gotten to the point where having a conversation with someone is basically impossible because of the tics.

Now, I deal with this pretty well, I'd like to think. I work from home, I have a great dog that I go on walks with, and I think my life is pretty good. I'm usually pretty sore and my sleeping schedule's all fucked up, but I'm okay. The problem is, being around anybody, even my family members, for any longer than about a half hour, is a nightmare. I'm so humiliated when I'm at a cousin's birthday party and I'm stuck screaming, Fucking CUNT! over and over. My family insists they really don't care, but it's so degrading and exhausting that it's just easier to stay home.

To focus on my parents for a minute, they empty-nested back in August, and my brother's 600 miles away at school. They've done really well with it, I think, but it's obvious they crave having kids to parent. My mom wants me to stay over at their house *constantly*. We've talked about it a lot, I've told her that it does me more harm than good to stay the night at their house, but all her instincts are screaming at her to take her sick child in and cure her with affection and closeness.

Here's a more solid example of this. Last week my grandparents asked me to come over and help them fix their computer. I was irritated because I knew my tics were going to go absolutely haywire the second I sat down, but I went anyway. Sure enough, it took forever, and about halfway through my grandpa goes, God honey, those look so painful, referring to my neck tics. I know my grandpa means well, but holy shit, I wanted to SCREAM. It's gotten to the point where I'm consoling my family members, constantly having to reassure them that yes, I am okay, yes, I am eating, no, my tics aren't crippling. In a perfect world, I would be able to sit everyone down and firmly explain everything, and no one would cry or tell me how worried they are about me. I know that sounds horrible, but I really need to have an adult conversation about this that's firm and sets boundaries. I love having my family's support, but their support right now is smothering me and is counterproductive.

---   
**tl;dr**: I have severe Tourette's that makes it almost impossible to be around anyone for an extended period of time, but my family doesn't understand that, and they want to bring me in instead of respecting my wishes to be alone. How can I help them understand that I know what's best for me in this weird situation, but that I still appreciate their love and support? I want to set boundaries that don't need to become hard and firm.","I [22/F] have a medical condition where being around people is near impossible, and I'm having trouble convincing my family of this.",0.0,False,39.0,21.0,1423162097.0,/r/relationships/comments/2uwc3w/i_22f_have_a_medical_condition_where_being_around/,NonRomantic
27403,Non-Romantic,2u6222,"Our group, at its core, consists of four girls: Me, Emma, Alison, and Liz. We have been since freshman year, and we are seniors now.

As with any group, we have had our ups and downs. Most notably, I had a falling out with them in sophmore year when I started dating a guy and he isolated me from them. I actually posted about it on reddit back when it happened and everyone assured me he was highly abusive. It started out okay but eventually during that time I stopped talking to my friends altogether because he convinced me they were horrible bitches and that he was the only one who truly understood me. I was young and had gone through a lot of abuse before that by other people so I was vulnerable to it. While it was happening, my friends would always get angry at me for abandoning them. 

I didn't understand at the time that when you are dating someone, they should want to be a part of your life instead of separating you from it.

A few months ago, Liz started dating this guy, let's call him John. They actually hung out with us for a while and it was pretty good, but as they got closer they would start whispering to each other and then randomly leaving to take a walk (basically just talking alone for the entire lunch time). This has escalated to the point where John won't even let Liz walk to class with us girls because apparently we spend too much time with Liz. Several times, Liz has been in the middle of a sentence and as soon as John calls out her name, she will leave WITHOUT SAYING A WORD to go talk alone with him. 

I've talked to her so many times about this, asking her to please continually reexamine her relationship with John. She constantly makes excuses for him. For example, the other day he hung out with us and brought up the issue of the n-word, and claimed it was unfair that people got mad at him when he used it because he isn't black. I explained the reasoning behind this (I'm black myself and have been affected by this word) and he still told me I was wrong. The other girls in the group told him he was being racist. Liz just stood by, completely silent. Later when I asked her what she thought, she said that she thought he was racist too but didn't want to make him feel insecure or bad about what he said. After that situation he decided that our whole group hated him and that he could no longer hang out with us. Liz and John use this excuse now as the reason why they will never talk to us.


Whenever we try to get Liz alone to talk about it, John complains that we're gossipy and are trying to turn Liz against him. That's not our intention at all: we are happy that Liz can be happy with someone. However, we believe their relationship is not healthy. She spends so much time talking to him and she literally has not turned in one assignment this semester (she is failing EVERY class). We've tried to talk to John, too, but he claims that Liz is perfect and that we are too critical of her. We just don't want Liz to destroy her life. 

I have an especially personal stake in this because I went through the exact same thing. I know just how manipulative people can be, how they can completely isolate you to the point where it's EXTREMELY difficult to get out because no one else will talk to you or support you. When I broke up with my toxic ex, it took so long to rebuild my friendships because they were in shambles and no one could forgive me. I love Liz and I don't want it to get to that point. I don't want to hate her. Our group is willing to stick by her but it's also compromising our personal dignities when she continually treats us horribly and yet expects us to welcome her with open arms.


I don't know what to do, or how to talk to her about this. I know that pushing the issue and getting firm will just give John more ammo that will convince her that our group isn't a good influence. Please, I need some advice: not only for my feelings, but for my Emma and Alison's feelings, and for Liz's wellbeing. These seem like the beginnings of an abusive relationship and I feel like it's only a matter of time until she ceases contact with the group.

My boyfriend of 4 months has been considering dropping his fraternity for many reasons, but he also does not want to loose his friends in the process. I know this is a hard decision and he asks me what he should do but I'm just not sure what to say.


He only likes about 25 of the 100 brothers in the house. He does not want to live in the house because it is pretty gross from the parties they have had there. He also feels like he would not be able to study there with the distractions of his brothers, which could lower his gpa.
We also as a couple have only gone to a couple of the parties they had this semester because we don't have fun there. We have fun when we drink at home and just chill out.


I also know he doesn't want to lose his friends. And that is hard because you don't want to feel alone but you also don't want to be apart of something that makes you unhappy. And starting over, finding new friends is scary but maybe the friends he has aren't the people he should be hanging around with anyways (especially if they get pissed by his decision to quit), I don't think those are true friends, real friends should support your decision.


I want what is best for him, but I don't want to pressure him into making a decision he doesn't want to make. Some of the brothers know he is thinking about dropping and I think they believe it is because of me, which I hope is not the case and that he would truly be doing this for himself.


TL;DR; boyfriend wants to drop fraternity, likes 25 of the brothers, doesn't want to live in, doesn't go to many parties. He doesn't want to lose his friends but true friends would support him. I want the best for him but I don't want to pressure him either way.

To start off, I'll add some back ground information. I started dating my husband[38] when he was 34, four years ago. It wasn't until it was a year into our relationship that I met his daughters, twins, from his previous marriage. They were only 11 at the time and still in secondary school and my husband only had custody of them on the weekends so I only saw them every so often, but we got along fantastically and I adored them. This relationship continued until they were thirteen and their father and I got engaged. I decided I wanted more future step-mother/daughter times so I set up dates. I would take them shopping, for hair appointments, nail appointments, a spa weekend etc. so we would get to know each other and to be honest, I was terrified of becoming the evil step-mother in their eyes so I tried really hard to get them to like me.
I make a comfortable living so I spoiled them a bit during these trips, but they seemed to love being around me so I continued to do so up until my husband and I's wedding. 

The current problem:

The shopping dates never stopped after I married their father, I enjoy them as much as the girls do and I love being able to buy them things. But my husband thinks they've started to take advantage of me. The things they are asking me to buy are more and more expensive with each trip, and they want more. One of my stepdaughters wanted me to book her a $750 hair appointment the other day for her birthday, now I have the money and would of done so but my husband says that is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single appointment and that I will have to think of something else for her birthday. Her sister isn't any better and is requesting a 3,000 dollar handbag for her birthday from me. I think I have made a huge mistake by spoiling these girls, and my husband has drawn a line and made me see the my mistakes. I don't know what to do now.

To cut to the chase, my sister is visiting from overseas with her son. She and I had an agreement that she could share my phone with me because she doesn't have one that works in the states, and I rarely use my phone. However, then there's this problem with my nephew who is a year and nine months. He always messes with my phones settings, and has dropped my phone multiple times. Not only that, he has also damaged two of my other siblings phones(somehow he caused both their phones to have a fucked up touch screen, and one of their phones to turn on by itself...)


This raised alarm, so I told my sister I do not my nephew touching my phone, and that since he came out her vagina, she is responsible for him. I have also started grabbing my phone away from him whenever I saw him. Once, I tried grabbing it from him and he freaked out and gave it to his mom. I told his mom/my sister to give me my phone, and she said no and that she'd give it back to me when he isn't paying attention. This struck a nerve... She was telling me she would not hand me my phone back because her son would tantrum if she did. So I tried to wrestle the phone from her hands, and she started yelling and her baby started yelling so I gave up. She gave me my phone later like she said she would, but still, I find it fucked up I can't have my phone because her son would cry. 


Then one day my other sister(Okay, I have three sisters...) told me she saw my nephew drop my phone today. This was after I told my 27 year old sister not to allow my nephew to play with my phone anymore. So I told her if I see her son with my phone one more time, I'll be changing a password and locking her out of it, and she'd be banned from using it. 


She agreed reluctantly, but low and behold my nephew continued to get his hands on my phone. At this point I'd just grab my phone away from him and not care if he'd tantrum or not.  Whenever I confronted my sister with that, she'd say What do you want me to do. I was sleeping. I wasn't around. Is it too much to ask she put it in a high place he can't reach it? 


Anyway then I started to notice my phone touch keyboard was being changed to different one. This annoyed me.  I fixed it. It happened again, and then I warned my sister. Then it happened again the next day(which is today). Now here's today's story. My sister has my phone(she has it basically all the time because I socialize with my friends over facebook or skype, while she recently got a job). I look at my phone, and my background is changed, and I have a bunch of stupid apps all over my phone. Like... NBA game times, amazon, and a bunch of random game apps...


At first she makes an excuse saying that she must of accidentally downloaded them while trying to put an address into the GPS, but after she realized how bullshit that sounded she admitted that she let my nephew play around with my phone during a car ride. Let me note that this has been over the 5th time I have seen my nephew with my phone after I made the threat of locking her out of my phone. So what do I do? I tell her I'm going to factory restore my phone. Not that she couldn't use it anymore, just that I was gonna to factory restore it to delete all the stupid apps that were on it.


She goes crazy saying no, she has important numbers. I promise her that I will save all the numbers on paper before I factory restore, and she says that all the text messages will be deleted, and that they're super important and she needs them so much. I asked her why, and she said since she was working an off the table job, she needed to keep the text messaging proof that she's working for this lady in case she doesn't get paid. I tell her I'll screenshot the texts before I factory restore. She says no.  At this point I was being irrational. Sure, I could've just changed my wall paper and deleted my apps... But I wanted to factory restore. So I tell her too bad I'm going to factory restore anyway.


She then goes No, fuck you, fuck you. Starts crying and runs out the door. My mom and sister tell me just to factory restore my phone after she leaves next month, and I say no and follow her to get my phone. I don't want to physically take it from her, so surprise surprise I don't get it. So I finally get angry, run upstairs, and throw all her shit out of my room(me, her, and my nephew all share a room since I have the second biggest bed room). 


From downstairs she calls me a faggot(untrue), and says that guys fuck me in the ass(untrue). I then retaliate telling her that she's had her cousins dick inside of her(true), that I hope her husband beats her more(she married her cousin who is abusive), and that it's funny how she'll think she'll find someone else after she divorces him. 


Anyway, now she's sharing a room with another sibling, but I'm not getting my phone back. One thing that I regret is that when I got my phone I was going to buy it with my money that I had saved up, but my dad told me don't worry about it. What a mistake that was. My sisters always gang up on me saying It's not your phone, did you pay with it with your own money? You never charge it! You never use it! 


I talked to my dad today telling him I want my phone back from my oldest sister, and he said that it isn't my phone... Even though he bought it for me, and I was wiling to pay with it with my own money. He then said even if I did pay for it with my own money, it still wouldn't be mine until I could somehow pay back all the phone bills he's paid for the last two years(I don't have a job)...


Also, everyone in my family is on my sisters side. Is there anything I can do to get my phone back? 


   
**tl;dr**: My sister and I got in a fight over my nephew messing with my phone on multiple occasions after I specifically told her to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it. Nothing changed, nephew downlaoded a bunch of stupid apps, I wanted to factory restore my phone, she wouldn't let me and is keeping my phone for the rest of 
the month.

27464,Non-Romantic,358jw4,"My friend and I have been friends for about ten years, we lived together for about half a year when I was nineteen and everything went pretty well. She fell into some tough times after I moved out and we lost contact, I helped her get a job two months ago where I work so I've been driving 20 minutes away to give her a ride until she gets a car. She now lives with a mutual friend [20F] that I've known for just about as long.


Last week, our mutual friend asks if we can meet up so I can give her some advice. I've had quite a few roommates, some of which were great, some of which I was incompatible with but got along fine after we parted ways, and some of which were just mean people. From what I could tell her complaints were in the category of being incompatible roommates. I let her vent and offered some solutions - after all, she's younger than me and I started living on my own when I was younger than her, and I know how difficult it can be getting along with your first roommate.


She also had some complaints about mooching, and I pointed out that she has only just gotten two paychecks and they've all gone to bills, she just paid them off with her most recent one. I still understand how it feels but our friend has had a really tough life - her dad was completely absent and even asks her for money, her mom was really horrid and left the country when she was 19 or 20, so she really has no support system.


I live with my boyfriend and his best friend. The best friend is out of town for the week so there's space for an extra person until Saturday. On Monday I get another text saying they had a huge fight but didn't get into why. I was fine with this, I didn't want to get involved, just help out my two good friends get through this rough patch. I told her that I would offer her to spend the week at my place when I picked her up without mentioning the argument, just use the excuse that we have space because of my roommate being out of town. She agreed and was grateful. When I suggested this to my other friend, she looked really happy and agreed right away. She didn't mention the fight either, or even that there was tension in her living situation. Again, I took this silence as a good thing.


This was the first time we spent a substantial amount of time together in a while, and at first it was really fun! My boyfriend works a different shift than us, but for the few hours that the three of us were all together it was really fun and they got along. Her things began to pile around the couch and coffee table but I was okay with shoving them out of the way when the space was needed. Food starting disappearing fast (not ramen but pricey fresh fruits and stuff like that), but I mean, another mouth to feed, right? Stuff like this, excusable because I'm her hostess, but also kind of irritating in ways hard to describe...


So today, after a long morning of doing annoying bureaucratic nonsense with my car title and stuff, I got home, tidied off the coffee table, and decided to surprise my boyfriend with a nice beef stew when he got home. I put every ingredient, container, and utensil I needed on the coffee table, and set up some House of Cards. It took a good fifteen minutes to set it all up, and five minutes later she sits down next to me, gets into a group chat on speaker on her phone, and gets to gaming. I inform her politely that the computer in my roommate's room has Skype and that he's okay with us using it, and she cheerfully declines. I don't know how to make it any clearer without being rude so I turn off the TV, haul all the food and cooking junk to the kitchen, and work in boredom. She even comes in halfway and asks if she had been bothering me, and I said I didn't mind what she was doing but I had set all that up and was trying to watch TV, and she just says oh and gets back to gaming and shouting on the couch.


I mean, I live in an apartment full of gamers, so I'm totally fine with what she was doing. Anywhere but directly next to me would have been fine. She turns down my solution, but even when I clearly tell her I didn't care for her behavior nothing really came of it. I spent the entire day in my room because I didn't want to have to tiptoe around to not disturb her and her friends.


Is there anything I could have done differently? Should I have stayed out of their issues all together? I just didn't feel that was an option and was honestly pretty excited to hang out with her for a week... (plus it would save me gas money because I carpool with her and her house is not close). What do I do from here? I don't see a way of getting her out after promising her a place until Saturday morning without seeming really terrible, plus I would feel bad for my other friend because they clearly need time away from each other to cool off.


TL;DR: I invited a longtime friend and former roommate a place to stay for a week because her living situation is rocky, halfway through it turns out she's messy and eating a lot of our decent food, also kinda rude with commanding the entire living room to herself despite other options and direct requests that I wanted to use the entertainment space. How do I handle the rest of the week while being a good hostess and keeping our friendship intact?


EDIT: Firstly thanks for all the replies, I wasn't expecting so much input. I appreciate it.

The confusing bit for me is that half of the commenters say that I was being very clear, and half of them are saying of course this happened, you weren't clear enough. I'm not sure who I agree with more because both sides made good points.

I took her back to her place after our night shift. I told her that I really wanted to give the apartment a good cleaning before my roommate got back from vacation and I didn't want to bother her because I need a lot less sleep than her (which is actually true). She was fine with it, we got her stuff and took her home. The carpooling arrangement is the same, which I didn't realize was a mooching situation until multiple people pointed it out. I may talk with her about it if she doesn't offer any help over the course of next week I think I've become a part of their drama without meaning to, but since she's no longer present I can distance myself from it pretty well and go back to being neutral if they try to bring me into it.

So yeah, since the immediate situation I posted about was dealt with, there are a few posts that were made that aren't relevant and I won't reply to, but many people gave advice on my social habits as a whole, which is the root of this and some other issues I've had in the past. I'll continue to reply to those, but not the ones regarding a situation that, as far as I know, is over.","I [22F] invited my longtime friend [23F] to stay over for a week because of her roomie issues, three days in and I'm already at my limit.",0.0,False,44.0,32.0,1431044508.0,/r/relationships/comments/358jw4/i_22f_invited_my_longtime_friend_23f_to_stay_over/,NonRomantic

My brother lives on the other side of the country, in a very expensive city, and is attending grad school, paid for by my grandparents.  

When my grandmother went blind, she asked me to start acting as her secretary. It’s mostly just writing checks to keep the utilities running.  Included in the monthly bills are payments to my brother for school -- which are shockingly low!  He lives in an expensive city and attends an expensive private university.  He does not work because of his studies. He must be receiving heavy government subsidies and somehow making it work.  Either that or… he isn’t in school at all.

This is a nasty thought, probably due to my resentment at being one of the caretakers in this situation.    Brother recently (allegedly) completed his BA. This suspicion came to a head a few weeks ago when I started googling “Brother Name” + “Expensive Private University”.  No results.  Which is weird, right?  But then even weirder is the fact that he’s lived in this city for years and has NO friends from school.  When I can afford to visit him, I never see books.  He graduated with his BA last year and didn’t walk in the ceremony; I’ve never seen a diploma.  I’m feeling like this is all a lie to have my grandparents fund some kind of adventure while I’m stuck digging through dirty diapers because grandfather may have thrown his dentures away. 

Should I confront Brother?  I mean, it is Grandparent’s money to do with as they will.  If I’m wrong, I will be SO wrong.  Like, worst sister on the planet wrong.

I have to be honest about something. My mom isn't Jewish, so I'm not Jewish. I've identified as a Jew for more than a decade but realize as an adult that I will never be able to become a full member of the Jewish community unless I converted Orthodox, which is not something I would ever entertain. I didn't tell you two about my background because when I told people in XXXXXX, they said some really hurtful things to me and I didn't want the situation to repeat itself. But you two are swell, you're the coolest couple I've met in a long time, and XXXXXX is a convert and can probably sympathize with the situation I am in and what I am feeling, so I feel comfortable telling you this.

I've been living in an identity that doesn't belong to me. It's stressful and I find that the joy I get out of engaging with Judaism isn't quite enough to offset the stress that comes from existing liminally at the edge of a community and to not having honest access to my father's heritage. I've decided it's probably in my best interest (and also in the interest of the Jewish people) to move and live my life at a removal from Judaism. I will certainly miss some things (Shabbos, the mysticism, the holidays, the food, and most importantly, the community) but I am sure of this decision because it is the responsible and honest thing to do since I have no plans or intentions of conversion. 

I'm sorry-- I know this isn't what you or XXXXXX were expecting to hear from me, but please know this a necessary step in order to live my life honestly and that I really cherished the time I could spend with you two and your family.

I'm going to try to break this down into a concrete solicitation of advice, but as things get bleaker and more unmanageable every single day, anything helps: affirmation, constructive criticism, funny GIFs. 

My family is all kinds of dysfunctional. My dad's not in the picture and hasn't been for years. We're not financially stable. My mom was just diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, so I moved back home to help take care of her. And that means exposing myself, once again, to my sister's abuse and my mom's tolerance of it. And that's where our story starts. 

For years, it was just the three of us -- me, my sister, and my mom. My mom was out of the house a lot, working two jobs. My sister and I stayed home together after school. It took a really long time for me to come to terms with the fact that what I had always considered to be run-of-the-mill fighting with my sister was actually abuse. 

My sister's bigger and stronger than me. We'd get into it pretty much every day after school. For years, I thought that when she hit me, or punched me, or dragged me across the floor by my hair, it was my fault -- for giving her attitude, for talking back. My mom would punish both of us whenever I told her my sister had hit me, so I learned to stop telling her. I had to live by a really complex set of rules when I was younger, all of them put in place because my sister would throw tantrums and my mom would give in to keep the peace. I wasn't allowed to sing. I wasn't allowed to play music, or practice piano. I wasn't allowed to watch TV above a certain volume. I wasn't allowed to use my sister's bathroom, or touch her things, or enter her room. 

My mom giving in to keep the peace has continued up until the present day -- and that means regularly telling me to back off, or to stop provoking her. We all have learned to navigate my sister's tantrums and her abuse -- not to walk too loudly in the house, not to cook things she doesn't like, not to turn the TV up past 27 or borrow her things or use her bathroom. But it sometimes feels like a game of minesweeper. 

As I got older, the abuse changed. My sister couldn't tackle me to the floor anymore, or lock me in the closet. Whenever we'd fight, she'd pretend she was about to hit me, and laugh when I'd flinch. Or she would walk into my room and break something. Sometimes, she'd slap me, or wait until my back was turned and kick me. I'm still working through how easily I get startled, or how much loud noises unsettle me, but I think I'd been doing pretty well with all of this until now. 

I've tried to confront her, and my mother, about the abuse. It got so bad once that I had to check into a hotel after my sister broke my phone when I told her I was scared and that if she continued to threaten me, I'd call the police. But my sister's answer is that I'm emotionally abusive, and that gives her the right to be physically abusive -- that the same way I use my words, she can use her hands. I've done a lot of soul-searching about whether the first part is true -- and I don't think it is -- but I don't think that anything anyone says to you, EVER, is a reason to physically abuse them for years. 

My mom sometimes parrots my sister's defense back to me, saying that I provoke my sister. But because my mom's health has been deteriorating for a while, she often begs me to just take it -- and to work hard to help my sister, professionally, to get into graduate school, saying that if I love her, I'll work harder to get along with my sister and help her. I know that's manipulative. But I really love my mom. I consider her my best friend and I don't want to disappoint her, so I work hard and do the best that I can. I've spent weeks helping my sister apply to jobs and graduate schools. During that time, I know that my sister knew my mother would yell at me if I didn't help her complete these applications, and that as a result, she would often do a crappy job, knowing that I would rewrite them to avoid fighting with her. 

Finally, though, I had to put my foot down. My sister still lives at home, and I like coming home for the holidays. But when I returned to my hometown for graduate school three years ago, I rented a room near school. I told my mom that my sister and I clearly can't co-exist, and that the best thing for all of us is for me to live somewhere else for the time being. 

But this year, two things changed. First, my sister attempted suicide over the summer. I'm relieved she didn't go through with it, and I think she's finally getting the help she needs. She's seeing a therapist and on medication.

Second, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. I spent weeks in the hospital with her, in and out of emergency rooms, while juggling two jobs and my classes, because my sister doesn't like hospitals. I finally moved back home to help with my mom's day-to-day care, and that's where I am right now. I don't mean to be unfair to my sister -- this is unmanageable for one person. It takes an entire support system to coordinate someone's care. 

My mom's illness is taking a huge toll on all of us -- but my mom most of all. She's irritable, depressed, paralyzed, and in constant pain. Every day is a struggle. But I could deal with that. What I can't deal with is living with my sister. 

We fight every day. There is literally nothing I can do to avoid fighting with her, and trust me, I don't usually start these fights and I don't defend myself -- she just comes into the room and starts yelling at me. If I tell her off -- once when she started driving dangerously, telling her off for being fucking crazy -- she'll call my mom each time, or call my mom and lie, telling my mom that I told her to go kill herself, and creating another fight, now between me and mom. 

We agreed to split up the week between us so that we each get days off. I'm a full-time student juggling two part-time jobs. She's unemployed and spends her days off sleeping or going to the gym. So on my days off, I study and go to work; on her days off, she goes out. But almost every week, she'll tell me she just doesn't feel up to it one day, and suddenly that day will be my responsibility. She yells at my mom if my mom complains or says she's in pain. She's deeply unpleasant to be around, and I honestly believe that she uses her depression as a way of avoiding responsibility. My mom's car broke down, and she won't even help me get to the library or drop me off or share our family's second car -- I've been walking around suburbia in the rain and studying in a local pizzeria. 

So we're at an impasse. I can't confront her about how shitty she's being, because any time I even get close to confronting her, she starts talking about how bad I'm making her feel and about how this makes her want to kill herself. I can't expect my mom to mediate, because she rightfully points out that she's in no condition to be the peacemaker when she's fighting for her life. I can't leave, because I know my mom needs my help and needs me here. But I can't stay, because each day that passes, I can feel myself becoming more and more depressed and unhappy and worn down, and I don't know how to make this better.

27487,Non-Romantic,299dfk,"To preface this, I actually like these people outside of the gym. They are otherwise smart, capable, and good friends.  This post just highlights the negatives so of course it sound so much worse when it isn't balanced, so keep that in mind. I just need to get this off my chest and solicit a little perspective. Thanks for listening.


My two friends and I started rock climbing together about 1.5 years ago and progressed quickly because we are in the gym 3 days a week. In the past 8 months I have been putting in extra effort in training and it really shows in my skill level.  They don't do any extra, which is fine. It's not even the gap in our skill levels that bothers me.  What bothers me is the constant negativity and unwillingness to make improvements on things that they constantly complain about.


I have stopped giving advice or beta (when it is asked for, I try to avoid giving beta unless it is solicited) because it gets thrown back in my face with the attitude of,  well that's easy for you, because you are just naturally good at climbing. It's like saying that Asian kid is good at Math because he is Asian, not because he works for it. I've mentioned this and it was promptly dismissed. Well maybe a little, but you are just a natural so it's much easier for you


When they come down off of a route that they struggled with, they name all the things wrong with that route and how it could be improved to better suit them and their ability. When they can't do something, it isn't because they need to work harder or be more strategic, it's because they are too short, or their leg doesn't bend that way, or because the route wasn't built correctly. This has spawned another interesting dynamic: they now believe that they are better than I am because they have all these perceived handicaps that they have overcome. I am not interested in who is better. It's not a contest! It's not like I don't have issues (who doesn't?), I just don't whine constantly about them. 


The constant I can't, I hate that, that sucked is really wearing on me. For example, when they say that they are struggling with fear of falling (constant in this sport), I say that  personally, bouldering really helps me get over it. They say that they are too scared to boulder.  I mention that that's is the point, to do something you are scared of, or bad at, until you aren't.  This is met with a roll of eyes and a, Sharkbutter, that is just because you are crazy. 


Or another gem that has started - I am pretty strong and tend to muscle my way though things when I don't know what to do so when I mess up footwork somehow and make it more difficult instead of using proper technique it is now known as sharkbuttering it (insert my name instead of user name). It was sort of funny the first 7 times but now it's a thing and I am starting to resent it because of everything else.


It is now to the point where I take joy when they struggle because of a sick I told you so mentality.  I never say anything and try to keep positive, or at least silent because I want to be an example and not feed into their negativity.

It's not all bad! It seems like, contrary to all evidence during the sessions, they get a lot of satisfaction from the sport. They must, if they keep doing it. They are great cheerleaders when they aren't being dicks. 

So, give me some perspective:

-Maybe I am doing something to breed resentment on their end?

-Am I being too sensitive?

-I know I can't change them, so what can I do to change my attitude toward them?

-Do I salvage this aspect of our relationship, or move on? How do I salvage? If I should move on, then how do I dump them without damaging the friendship?

-If nothing else, they are reliable climbing partners.  They are good friend and I don't come by that easily, so I don't just drop friend when shit gets tough.

-I feel a little better just writing this. A little.

His mother is an author so I went to the library and borrowed out every single one of her books. In the acknowledgments she thanked her children and grandchildren by name. I searched the names of her grandchildren on Facebook and found my half brother.


Through the profile of my half brother I found the profile of my father, he was using a pseudonym. I Googled the pseudonym and pretty much hit the jackpot of information. Forums, YouTube videos, twitter, imgur and a very active Reddit account spanning a number of years. Turns out we like the same music, food and have the same sense of humour. We even have the same breed of dog. For some reason it bothers me that he seems to be a person that I think I would get along quite well with.


So, what to do? I initially sent a friend request on Facebook which was ignored, I feel as though if he wanted to contact me he would have no problems finding my contact details and I should just not waste my time with him, yet I really would like some kind of closure. 


I've tried composing countless messages but they never read quite right, there seems to be no easy way to say Hey there guy, you've been giving me the cold shoulder for years. Want to chat about that?

27541,Non-Romantic,2gactl,"My work is a male dominated industry which entails a lot of conflict resolution at an employee level and with senior managers. As such, I am used to dealing with divas and overly unreasonably angry people with an equally emotional response when warranted. It may sound strange, but in the moment, these diva types can snap out of their trance when you subject them to something similar.

Over the last decade, my work personality has become more and more to what I think is assertive and it's trickling into my personal life. Others would call me arrogant, aggressive and dominant. My friends and family think I actually enjoy firing people because it happens so regularly that I have the nickname at work as 'the executor'. In actual fact, it's always difficult and distressful for me no matter how many times I do it. My family and friends listen but it doesn't stop them from thinking I'm ruthless and cold blooded.

I find it hard to connect with others in my personal life because I can't help saying exactly what I think - which is often something critical. I get really frustrated at indecision and then take over because I don't have the patience to wait for the while group to decide. My partner works in my industry but is much lower down the chain. I can't help giving too much advice about what he can do to improve. These qualities make me great at my job - but I can't seem to switch it off. 

Which is another problem.

I have a lot of conflict with trying to be me - I  don't even know who I am anymore. Is the real me the work me or my personal life me? I like work me more but others don't warm to it. I feel sorry for my partner - he is a conflict avoider but loves me nevertheless. I love him too but it does frustrate me he avoids conflict rather than deal with it hands on - especially when we argue. 

Are there any others of you out there like this? How do you deal with this?

27552,Non-Romantic,1wz18e,"I come from a pretty broken home. There was a lot of verbal abuse from my father targeting mostly my mother but also me at times. It wasn't bad all the time and I didn't realize my Mom's addiction to a few years ago. I guess denial or just always trusting her and never putting the pieces together. From about the time I was 10 until I moved out at 19 mom was never home. Younger, she'd be home around 9pm-12am. In highschool she'd get home anywhere from 10pm-6am. My dad works out of state as well and is gone for 10 months out of the year as well so it would mostly just be me and my brother who is a year younger then me. At 18 my dad, being a blue collar worker, had his hips break. He couldn't work for two years so it was me and my brother trying to support him while he was healing from hip replacement. During this time they got a divorce. 

Fast forward to when I'm 24. Paternal grandfater dies I get his house. Take out a second mortgage on the house to give my brother money since I got the house and also because I want to do renovations on it. Hire Mom's boyfriend. Mom's boyfriend comes across as ADHD and never looks you in the eye and is way too talkative and has a bunch of energy. Later from being around I also noticed he wears colored contacts of the same eye color so you don't see his dialated eyes. 

During renovations him and mom break up. He always has this leather pouch on him. Curious, I swiped it from the counter and took it to the bathroom. Obviously meth or coke in small baggies. This guy doesn't have a fucking clue what he is doing but I trusted him since mom vouged for him, I was paying him 10/hour or something and he was working 40 hours a week. Without going into details hiring him fucked me royally. Projects that I thought were good and well are needing to be redone, like entire bathrooms because the showers leak. Basically, everything he did has to be redone. Get a phonecall from dude asking for my grandma's number. He tells me that she went apeshit on him and that she was on drugs. Figured it was some childish bullshit to cause drama. So I take it with a grain of salt considering they were breaking up. Confront mom about the drugs he had on him. She said she didnt' know anything. Didn't confront her about her drug use. If you confront her about anything or if she feels guilty about anything you don't see her for a few weeks and she won't answer her phone. 

Also, in between everything she has an on again off again relationship with this dude who has beat her multiple times. We will call him Jason. I figure there is nothing I can do about this situation other then telling her I'm there for her and that I'd rather her not see him. I'd like to beat the motherfucker to near death but it wouldn't resolve anything. I'd end up in prison and she'd still be with him. I figure she will have to leave him of her own accord. 

I have met her friend, we will call him Carlos. Carlos is an alright dude, or I thought at the time. I met him before mom's boyfriend fucked up my house. We would smoke occasionally. He helped with a couple things here in there. Mom was staying at my house occasionally. So after the renovations and after mom moved out and dated the dude who did them. She wasn't staying at my house anymore. I left out of state for work. Mom mowed the lawn and said she felt bad about her bf fucking me over and that she would do her best to try to fix the house up. I don't know where that money went because I couldn't see any monetary improvement on the house. I had a few weeks of off time so I drove all night to get home at 3am. There is carlos sitting in my living room obviously has been living there for a while. My mom is in my bed with Jason. I didn't give her permission to live at my house. Carlos had been staying there for Idk how long. It was the middle of summer in TX and they had all the air conditioners set at fucking 65 degrees. 

She said Carlos was helping out with the house and he got kicked out of his house and she felt bad so she let him stay there. I was obviously pissed but I had to go back to work in a week so I just left it alone. A few months later while I'm away at work I get a phone call from carlos saying that I owe 700 bucks for electricity and they are about to cut it off. Tell him, No, you and mom owe 700 bucks. At this point I kinda hope the electricity and water gets cut off thinking the problem will work itself out and he will move out. 

The water and electricity get's turned off. A few months later I make it back home. Carlos is there. Carlos, hooked up the electricity illegally and stole a water meter from god knows where and has the water hooked up illegaly as well. Him hooking up the electricity is going to cost me 1800 bucks btw because now I need a master electrician to replace the meter loop. 

I come home, everything that I owned that was worth anything, except my computer. Was gone. Carlos says that someone broke in and here is a case number to turn into insurance. I don't have that kind of insurance. It's also funny how the burgular had the time to differentiate between a broken guitar and a broken one and grab the unbroken one. Same thing with a watch. Left the broken took the good. 

This is pretty much everything I own. Except for my pc and monitor which just so happens is Carlos' only source of entertainment. I have to be back to work in a few weeks out of state, again, and I figure if he did steal it I don't have proof. He might mad and take the rest or just do something drastic and I have no way of preventing it from 1200 miles away. Also, in the unlikely event he didn't steal it, it might be good to have someone there.  

During my few weeks off I snoop through his phone there is a bunch of drug references on it. A txt from my mom saying Jason can't come over tonight my son is back. Things of that nature. There is a meth pipe in his bag. The son of a bitch also had a few of my shirts in his drawer. 

Eventually I said enough is enough. Probably after he brought home a girl missing a bunch of teeth that looked 70 but said she was 35 also sporting a black eye. When he left he took a coffee maker of mine as well a couple odds and ends. I was happy with them gone as long as he just got out of my fucking house. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. My house has no power and no water since I've been taking steps to make it legitimate again but don't have the money to fix it yet. I happened to meet her current boyfriend at my grandmother's shop, where my mom works at. I went there to fix my gf's car. 

Fast forward to now. I've been home but staying at my dad's house since my utilities are fucked. My house to dad's house is a good 50 minutes and I happened to be near my house at around 8pm or so. Decided to get my mail. There is a car in the driveway. I don't think anything of it since the neighbors park at my house while I'm gone to make it look like someone is living there. They also mow my lawn. Love them. There is also a coke bottle on the table outside. So me and the gf go in. There are four fucking candles lit in the living room. At this point my gf is panicking and freaking out, quietly. I'm a big dude and this is my god damn house and if I have to die right now defending it, I'm ok with it. So I was just ready to knock someone the fuck out. 

I knock on the wall. Start to enter the hallway. I see a little guy and as he approaches I see it's moms current boyfriend. With a pissed sigh of relief I awkwardly shake his hand that he extended. I ask where my mail is. He says my mom has it and that she left 30 minutes ago. I ask where, he says Jason's. He sits outside. I look through my house. 

In the middle room, I guess his room there was a mattress pillows clothes everything. On the table was a razor blade and a mirror. In the hallway on a table is a glass flask beaker with a hole on the side for a tube. The doors that were closed a few weeks ago when I went to check on it are now open. The armoire in my room is open. My shed has been unlocked there is a can of CO2 and a can of Oxygen. Back porch has random shit like a fridge. 

I walk out to the front porch trembling because I'm so angry and calmly tell him he is not welcome at my house and that he has to pack up his shit and leave. Tell him there is a fucking razor blade and a mirror and a beaker that I don't know wtf is in my house for. Tell him he has to go. He asks for a couple days. Luckily the gf says I think it would be best if you left now. before I told him in a much less polite way to leave now. 

We sit awkwardly in disbelief and shock for a few hours while he moves all of his shit out of my house. I call mom about 4 times, she doesn't answer. He approaches my window I get out. He says something to the effect of he can't move everything tonight and if it's ok to leave a few things there until tomorrow. I say ok but if it isn't gone by tomorrow I'm calling the cops. He tells me that him and mom broke up that she is now with Jason and that he was homeless and she called him and told him he could stay at my house.

Please bare in mind that I *know* how childish this is but it's really bothering me and I need some Reddit perspective.

I am currently on a study exchange in a European country that I'll keep vague for anonymity's sake. The first week is a special 'culture' course where other exchange students get together, learn the native language (French) and go on excursions. We *all speak English*, half of us fluently, the other half almost fluently. This is important.

Early on in the course, we unintentionally split into groups; one half that speaks English exclusively (British, American, and then Italians and Russians who don't have other native speakers to converse with) and the other half that are all from the same country and speak French, German (their mother tongue) and English. The other half of the group, a mix of guys and gals, tend to speak in German when talking to one another. That's cool, it's their native language, that's not an issue. However, when sat with the rest of us they STILL speak in German, excluding us. Okaaaaaaaay no biggie, maybe they don't realise how exclusive it is and they aren't obliged to speak English to us.

However, it started to become pretty obvious they had no intention in including us in their group.

Yesterday we went on a trip to a city, organized by the university we are studying at. I arrived at the train station and the group of Germans were already there, along with the student coordinator (who is obviously fluent in French). I said hello, they said hello, then continued to all speak in French (despite knowing I don't know enough French to join in). Even the student coordinator, who is American and therefore fluent in English, didn't bother even trying to make small talk the entire twenty minutes I was stood alone there. They were even stood in a circle that I had to stand next to, rather than part of. Very uncomfortable. Luckily, my friends arrived and we stuck together. The Germans still didn't bother making any conversation.

Then when we arrive in the city, the student coordinator (ugh I'm just gonna call him Mike) gave us a very very quick and rushed guided tour of the city (in French). He kept rushing off when we were trying to take pictures/figure out where we were, and one of my friends overheard him bitching about us ('Yeah we can go when they finally catch up, may as well just go without them for fucks sake') not realizing my friend understands more French than the rest of us. I'm sorry, but on a guided tour are we not allowed to walk at our own *reasonable* pace and actually enjoy the city?! It's not like we were crawling on all fours or staring into the sun for hours on end. Turns out the reason he was rushing was because they (Mike and the German group, who apparently knew each other beforehand) wanted to get to the bar at the end of the tour. Just to add, they had also been drinking cucumber vodka (I think) from bottles that Mike had brought with him, without offering any to us (the other half of the group) which I thought was a bit rude.

Anyway, we get to the bar and want to sit outside. Great! Lovely view, cold but not unbearable in the sun. Mike and the Germans all sit round a tiny table and don't bother spreading out so we can sit with them. Despite there being another vacant table next to them, we could've dragged them together and sat as a group?? No, we sat on the other side of the garden and stayed there.

The train journey home, we all sat together in the same carriage. Bearing in mind the Germans had spoken German/French the entire trip, and Mike exclusively in French, they then decide to talk about their plans for the night in English in front of us. Why? They didn't include us in the conversation, despite speaking English, or even ask/invite us with them, so why talk in English? Found it a bit malicious and unnecessary.

I know this seems really childish but am I being too sensitive/expecting too much from them? I thought that when I came to study abroad everyone would want to experience different cultures and make new friends or am I wrong?? They are nice people (when you get them on their own) but sometimes it feels a bit fake or forced, so I've decided I'm not making an effort anymore. I just want to know if I'm being dramatic!

Background Story:

His gf's daughter said she wanted to give us a bunch of stuff for the girls (my two daughters), and proceeded to dump off 10 large garbage sacks of unwashed, reeking, crumpled miscellaneous househould items, bits and pieces of actual trash, stained, ripped and gunked up adult clothing, unmatched used socks, etc....and oh yeah, maybe about 3/4 worth of a bag of unwashed kids clothing.

My father later admitted that the woman actually thought she could get us to save her the bother of taking all that to a donation center herself. My father's girlfriend demands I thank her daugher for her 'generosity'.

My husband was deeply insulted by this, I was frustrated, and really, who even donates dirty, smelly, ripped, stained items in the first place? I would *never* dump such things on other people and pass it off as 'donating'. There's this little thing called respect for fellow humans....

So I called my father the next day and explained the situation and he agreed I didn't need to thank the woman, and he'd explain it to his girlfriend.

A few days goes by and he calls me up really pissed off.  Seems that his girlfriend decided to lie and claim that I called her up and spoke abusively to her on the phone about the incident.

So my father is harassing me about that, I'm vehemently denying it, and he's telling me that I've made his life difficult because now he has to put up with his girlfriend harassing him about me - they live together.  

I told him that I never called her on the phone, I absolutely never spoke to her with anything but politeness at any time, and that I never spoke to her about the incident at all.  But to make his life easier, I'd be willing to give her whatever apology he felt was needed to get her off his case.

He spoke with her again.  Turns out that she was actually pissed off at her daugher about something completely unrelated and decided to have her tantrum in my direction (the woman needs professional help imo). So there was no need to apologize.

So I told him that I felt that both his girlfriend and her daughter owed **me** an apology, but that I didn't expect it and wouldn't ask it from from them.

So then he goes on to insist that we merge the two families (for his and his girlfriend's convenience) for Christmas when he visits from out of state at that time.

I said no thank you, I really don't want to be around someone who lies about me to my father, causes me piles of stress and her daughter who views us as drudges to do her favors which we should thank her for the priviledge.

**HERE'S THE PART I NEED ADVICE FOR:**

So then my father accuses me of making his life difficult, making problems, Being unreasonable, not knowing how to behave around family politics, and because my kids would then not be able to have a Christmas playdate with his girlfriend's granddaughters, he also says that I am not thinking of (my) children, not being fair to (my) kids, and not putting (my) kids' needs first.

Which is really crappy because he had no problem abandoning my mother several months before I was born, and staying absent from my life for 30 years afterwards.

So how do I explain his victim-blaming to him?  The only one making problems and making things difficult is his girlfriend who started all this by deciding to lie about me, and her daughter with her own disrespect toward me and my family.

He's also done nearly the same thing to me over a previous girlfriend he had who tried the same thing.

I really want him to understand about why victim-blaming is wrong, because otherwise, he'll keep up the bullying, harassing and emotional blackmail against me until I give in.  He's already threatened to not visit my kids again - despite their recent loss of their grandmother - knowing it would devastate them - saying that it would be my fault if he did that.  (In past, to manipulate me he's also taken to taunting me saying that he would have been getting my girls things they've been looking forward to or taken them on fun outings, but it's my fault that now they won't have that.)

Advice is sorely needed to educate this man.  Thanks!

**TL;DR** My father is victim-blaming me for the fallout resulting from his girlfriend lying about me to him, wants me to stop standing up for myself and just 'take it' to make things easier for himself.  How do I educate him that he's victim-blaming and that it's a Not Good thing?

This woman (Jen) is the wife of my fiance's brother. They have been married for about a year, and before their wedding I was suddenly invited to be one of her four bridesmaids. She and I don't know each other well at all--we don't share a lot of opinions and I'd hardly consider her even a friend--so I was a little surprised but I accepted since she doesn't have a lot of female friends (or friends in general). Her MOH and other bridesmaids flaked on her and I kind of ended up running her bachelorette party unexpectedly. It wasn't a bad time, but it was awkward.


I have come to discover that Jen is generally unpleasant. She is a super controlling person who is almost literally attached at the hip to her husband (fiance's brother). If he's asked to do things away from her, he has to check with her or she throws a tantrum. She's thrown her ring at him and threatened divorce several times over the year they've been wed for pretty petty arguments. I've decided I don't really like her a whole lot and I really don't want that kind of negative influence at my side at my wedding--plus I have a number of good friends and don't really need a space-filler.


So. The problem is I have not made this obvious to her yet. I'm legitimately concerned that once this does become so, and she knows that her husband is going to be with my fiance at the alter and she will not be up there, she will find a way to sabotage her and the brother coming, which would be devastating to my fiance. I would hope that his brother would actively fight against this in order to go to his wedding, but he has made a LOT of concessions for her at the cost of his family relationships and she's just vindictive enough to possibly do the I made you a bridesmaid, how DARE you not make me one!

He just throws her outside without a leash and forgets about her (breaking city laws) and during the winter she'd be out there for a few hours in negative temperatures. We'd come home and she'd be running around the yard or the yard across the street (sometimes we'd hear him yell at her STAY IN THE YARD THIS TIME as if she could understand that..) and she's also constantly throwing up in the driveway. Also he just lets her poop wherever in the side yard and never picks it up. 



Anyway, our apartments are really small, and totally wrong for a dog her size. He works all day and leaves her locked in his apartment with a window open (there was one open all winter as well). When he first moved in we had an issue where she'd bark constantly. I'm not kidding, she'd bark almost 24/7. It freaked our cats out and we hardly got any sleep. Eventually she got used to the apartment and now she only barks when people come in or go out and if she sees a car drive by. 


Which brings us to the meat of the problem. He is constantly verbally and physically abusing her. We've been hearing him physically hitting her from the moment he moved in. Whenever she started barking he would start wailing on her and we'd hear her yelping and he'd be screaming at her to 'shut the fuck up'.

Cool Tony is friends with the landlord and she said there wasn't anything she could really do so Cool Tony told him that if we heard him hitting his dog anymore then we'd have to call someone to take his dog away. 


The hitting stopped (so we think), but now he's constantly screaming at her. Asshat's voice is super loud and to be honest it scares me. I don't feel safe when he's home and when I hear him screaming. And I just feel so bad for his dog. He screams such mean and obscene things to her. I haven't heard hitting, but I wouldn't put it past him to be doing other things to hurt her like choking her or other things that wouldn't make her yelp. 



I'm just not sure there's anything we can do.

We thought about stealing her when he lets her out and letting him think she's ran away and giving her to a family who wants her, but then he'd probably just get another dog and abuse that one too.


Sorry if this is everywhere, I just got woken up by Asshat screaming **'MOTH-ER-FUCK-ER.DO.NOT.BARK.SHUT.THE.HELL.UP.SHUT.THE.FUCK.UP.-USELESS.PIECE.OF.SHIT.-** over and over again at his dog for barking because Cool Tony came home and the door creaked. 

Edit; We're in Ohio, but I'll be looking around for more information in the area!

Thank you for your comments! I'm just not sure what we can do without any solid 'proof' of abuse. I think whenever he has a screaming fit I'll send boyfriend down to record it so we can keep track and come up with a plan of action from there.

My co-worker recently moved to the area, and is a single mother of a toddler. A bunch of us went out for drinks the other night, which was special for her because she rarely goes out and doesn't have many friends around town. 

Her and I got to the bar before everyone else, and we grabbed drinks and got a table. We're already kind of buzzed from the earlier in-office festivities. We start talking, and all she can talk about is how old she feels hanging out with me — six years her junior — and just being in the bar in general. I assure her there's nothing that really makes her older than I. I'm talking out of my ass and I pull out a stinker:

You know what really makes you older than me? Your child.

Oh my god, it was the most tactless, awful thing that's ever come out of my mouth. I feel really bad and awkward, even though she let me divert the conversation pretty quickly afterward. I'd like to somehow apologize... Any ideas on how best to do that?

Sometimes we hang out after work and in order to avoid gossip, we drive a few blocks to a quiet area to sit and talk. Lately, he's become more touch-y and has begun to hold my hand and touch my leg. The only physical contact I've initiated on my part are hugs (usually ones from the side) and here and there we give each other pats on the head (I know that some people hate others touching their head, but I enjoy it and he doesn't mind).

Here's the problem--he's taken. I've talked to him about not doing things that other people can misconstrue as inappropriate behavior, no matter how close we are as friends. He insists that he doesn't think he's cheating, and that he was always this intimate with his other female friends (touching legs, poking boobs, etc.) so that I shouldn't worry or be scared of his girlfriend finding out and misunderstanding.

My female friends think it's weird that he holds my hand at all, and one even thinks the head-patting is too intimate. Caressing the leg... well, he stayed in the knee area. Apparently to him, this is OK; he does, though, consider venturing into upper/inner leg area and breasts as cheating.

27657,Non-Romantic,3b1bbb,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Throwaway since he's a redditor. I'm not really sure where to begin, and this will probably be long so I’m sorry in advance. Growing up, my brother Alex always looked up to me. He might not have admitted it after the age of 7, but one could easily tell. Unfortunately Alex didn’t enjoy school at all, and around 6th grade his laziness caught up with him. Alex stopped doing his homework, and he stopped studying for tests; when confronted about the test scores by my parents, he lied and said his teacher had entered the grade wrong online. His compulsive lying got my parents humiliated multiple times in parent-teacher meetings when the teacher would prove my brother had been lying. Alex’s and my relationship began to wither around this time. He became distant and was no longer the joyful, friendly person I once knew. We all noticed this but never got an answer from him regarding the behavior change.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This behavior continued up through present day. After just finishing 10th grade, my parents are ready to quit. We are all tired of the constant fighting and compulsive lying about everything school related. I have been off at college for 2 years, but I am back for the summer and this is the worst it has ever been. Alex completed 10th grade with a D(60-69%) in Honors English and a C(70-79%) in AP computer science and B’s(80-86%) in everything else. My parents have been desperately trying to find the root of this problem. Alex has been in therapy for a year now, supposedly discussing his school problems and cold demeanor. There hasn’t been any significant results yet. I’ve tried discussing family therapy with my mother, but she doesn’t think it will be worth it. If anyone has any convincing arguments I can present to her, that’d be great.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My parents are desperate for an improvement in Alex’s school performance, so they have been looking at expensive private schools for Alex to transfer to next school year. These private schools cost over $12k annually, and my family is very worried that changing schools might be a tremendous waste of money is Alex’s attitude towards school and life doesn’t improve. I am planning on talking to Alex in private about this very soon. I have been trying to improve my relationship with Alex for a while now, but haven’t succeeded. I want to try to approach Alex within a week and attempt to have a heart-to-heart conversation. I’m not entirely sure how to approach this situation and ease into finding out what’s going on in his life that’s causing this. Both my parents have attempted this many times over the past five years, but Alex always “shuts down” by barely answering and questions and getting a blank look over his face. I need to approach this right as this may be my only chance to do it right. I got back from school about three weeks ago, so I haven’t really discussed anything serious with Alex since September before school started.

Today, he mentioned how silly it was no one ever thought to ask for the maids' job since they make ~25$ an hour. With my part time job, another 200$ a month is a god send! I asked if he'd consider, but I feel bad putting the maids out of the job cause we're all friends, but hey, I'm 22 and out of school as of May 15th, I need to get moving.

Most of the time I worked there, I had a boyfriend, but a lot of the guys there still flirted with me anyway, even though they knew it wasn't going anywhere.  However, I've been single for a little over a year now.

A girl I work with, who I am also just becoming friendly with outside of work, decided that a guy we work with and me would make a good couple.  I sort of laughed it off and didn't think anything of it since she didn't bring it up to me again.  But then she told me that she told him the same thing, and she said at first he laughed it off too, but then he said something to her like, I would never give him the time of day, or something to that effect.  She told him she though I might.  This was a few weeks ago, so I forgot all about it.

Now he's messaged me on Facebook with his number saying I should text him sometime.  I don't want to ignore it, but I don't really want to go out with him either, which although he hasn't said it here, I can't imagine why else he would want me to text him.  He's a nice enough guy, but we don't have a thing in common.  I can't even imagine what we would talk about if he took me on a date.  I work there because I couldn't find any other work after college.  I left last year to teach English in France for the school year, and just came back a few months ago because, again, couldn't get a job.  I might be leaving in a few months to teach English in China (it's very preliminary yet, only a few close friends know it's a possibility).  He has no education, delivers for this restaurant and also works landscaping, and as far as I can tell, he doesn't have a lot of wider interests outside of his cars and drinking.  

I guess I could go out with him once and tell him I don't think we have enough in common, but I kinda don't want people I work with to know that I went out with him.  He dated another girl I worked with and I wasn't exactly impressed by his boyfriend behavior I guess.  Additionally, I am recovering from vaginismus.  I don't really sense he's the kind of guy who would be understanding, and I would be terrified that he might tell people, though that conversation wouldn't have to happen for a while.  

Should I just tell him no?  I don't want to date a coworker?  I don't think we have enough in common?  How on earth should I handle this???  He's a nice guy, I don't want to be a bitch, but I honestly don't think a relationship would ever work out between us.  

Also my real issue at the moment is how to respond to this message he sent me.  He hasn't actually asked me out, so I know I should calm down, but like I said, I can't imagine why else he would have messaged me his number like that.

27675,Non-Romantic,1veyxa,"My parents divorced when I was 21; I will be 30 in 3 months. It was amicable and they remain friends. After the divorce my dad did relapse into alcoholism, but he has since sobered up again and has been sober for a few years.  

I was in college across the country at the time. I have a brother who was in HS so lived at home and through this more directly. He seems much more accepting of the situation overall. After graduating college I stayed with my dad for a few months before relocating across the country again. I spent the next 7 years living far from my family but maintained strong and positive relationships with them.   

At this point, it basically feels like (to me and to my parents) I have not emotionally moved on from their divorce. From the start, I had a very difficult time dealing with the entire situation and particularly with their new partners. In my own estimation, I have always acted like a 14 year old around them. Sullen, don't speak to them unless spoken to, don't express any excitement or even friendliness in my voice...essentially, I don't engage. My mom has been with the same man for about 6 or 7 years. My dad has been in two serious relationships.      

For years, I have been able to float by like this. In reaction, my parents seem to generally avoid talking to me about their partners. They don't offer, and I don't ask. I would see them at holidays or for visits and would either scrape by with minimal interaction with partners (sometimes causing fights with my mom), or they would visit me without their partners.    

Now, I have moved back in with my mom in a different city than where I grew up. I have been here for a few months, and it will likely be a few months more. I'm planning to move out of her house, but remain in the same city as her. She is wonderful for helping me out, and we get along really well. She lives in a different state than her BF, but he visits for weeks at a time and is planning to also relocate in a few months. When it is just me and my mom, things are great.    

When her BF is here, I continue to have a hard time. Now that I am faced with the situation daily and more mature, I have truly and honestly tried to be better, but it feels impossible to make myself be open and nice to him. I can't make myself just do it - smile at him, engage him in conversation, anything. It doesn't help that he also is not very forthcoming or friendly with me (not as closed as I am, but he's never tried to get to know me or anything like that, either).  

Since being here, I have obviously spent a lot more time thinking about my situation than I ever did before. Two things have hit me:  

1. I am mad at my mom for the divorce (I have told her this). In my head, I respect her decision. But I just can't seem get past being mad at her. I'm mad because I feel she ended our family, and I'm mad because I feel like she's done nothing to try to help me get over this. Honestly, I feel like a spoiled brat even writing that. I want to forgive her and move on, but I don't know how. Does the anger ever just go away?  How can I make it go away?
2. I feel insecure around her and her BF (I have not told her this). She's different with him - drinks more (not a ton, but she NEVER drank when I was a kid. There was no alcohol in our house), stays out late, and is just different. I also don't feel he likes me very much and that makes me insecure around him. I know - why would he like me when I've been an ass? But also, there really is and never has been any effort on his part, either. He's a negative person (talks shit about his ex-wife and daughter all the time), and I assume that he is judging me and talks about me, too. I have all kinds of horrible thoughts about things I imagine him saying about me. Also, his politics are the polar opposite of mine, and he is kind of fervent about them (multiple NOBAMA and NRA bumper stickers, watches a lot of Fox news, etc.). It feels like she's gone and created a whole new life, and just left me behind, and that makes me feel so horrible and sad.

How do I move past this situation? I sort of feel like I'm still grieving for the loss of my family, and if I make any move toward acceptance of this situation I feel like I'm betraying...something. I don't know what. I still shed a lot of tears about this, and generally just feel like everyone else in my family has moved on, but I'm still hurting so much. I don't know how to make it stop, though.  

I can't afford therapy right now, but may be able to do so in a few months. I saw a therapist for a short time after I graduated but it didn't help much. She mostly said I need to get my own life straight and then I won't be as worried about them. I'm willing to try again, though, but was hoping you all might have some advice for me in the meantime.

I drive every month to see her and we make a weekend of it. 

I love her and speak to her three times a week and Skype on Sundays. I listen to her talk about things I don't even care about (church, clothes, etc) because I love hearing her be happy. So I feel really betrayed she would call me a bad son when I have always tried to make her happy and help her pay her bills. 

Is this something I can fix? I am lost. What do I do?

[Original Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/231mb7/update_i_20_f_need_to_tell_my_quadriplegic_dad_46/)

A little more than a year ago, I posted on this sub looking for advice on how to handle a long-failing relationship between my dad and I. tl;dr, I'm at school away from home and wanted to get a summer job, meaning I wouldn't go home for summer; my father is physically disabled and extremely emotionally dependent/manipulative; I was afraid everything would fall apart.


I posted the first update just before summer break. tl;dr: I went to therapy, got a job, was firm with my dad and ignored his guilt-trip; he was happy for me; success.



since in large part it's due to advice I got here, I just wanted to provide a last update that finished the story. 


So, a year ago- before summer, I did visit home for a couple weeks to see my family.  It was a disaster.  I came home to find that my dad was seriously, deathly ill. He'd lost at least 30lbs, had a constant cough, was pale, weak... I was shocked his nurse hadn't yet taken him to hospital. My dad kept saying he was fine, and when I pressed his nurse about it she basically said Please talk to him, he'll listen to you, he doesn't listen to anyone else and even if he's in a wheelchair you can hardly force an adult man to go to the doctor.  I was furious... both because he was so sick, and because it once again seemed I'd have to fulfill the role of mother-daughter-caretaker that has so emotionally-plagued me my whole life (and which I specifically went to therapy for). 


The second night I was home my dad was coughing up blood. Having already not slept through finals week, I stayed up all night listening to him, worried. Probably by that point I hadn't slept in four days.  I was so angry, I thought fuck it, if he can't be an adult, and I'm the adult, I'm gonna be the motherfucking mother and make this call.  At around 2am, I called the nurse, woke her up, and told her we were taking my dad to the Emergency Room NOW. It turns out he had pneumonia, which is especially deadly for quadriplegics since they lack the diaphragm muscles to properly cough out the fluid in their lungs.


The entire two weeks I was home, I was sitting by my father's hospital bed, watching him sleep and wither away. I didn't sleep, except for a couple nights where I got drunk with a good friend from high-school.  I was thinking about how I would phrase it when I'd have to call my brother and tell him our dad had died. 


On the 8th day he was in the hospital, his home-nurse and the doctor were sitting my dad up in bed when he began to hack more violently than usual- he toppled forward, and spit/threw/coughed up an enormous amount of phlegm.  Realizing that the motion and gravity were doing the job his diaphragm couldn't, over the next hours and days they repeatedly got his body to clear the fluid from his lungs. Finally the antibiotics began to take effect... he survived, gained some weight and strength, and was released from the hospital the same day I flew back to school for the summer.  


And I had exactly the sun-dazed break I'd hoped for, working and reading and spending time alone by the river, in coffee-shops, in bed... Most importantly, every Sunday I had scheduled Skype chats with my dad. Throughout life, I have always tip-toed around his feelings, doing my best to appease him, make him happy, etc... well, you can read the first post for a long explanation of all that. Physical disability aside, I know the emotional instability and manipulation is a common one. But after the pneumonia-fiasco, that just couldn't happen anymore. I'd aggressively taken charge of that situation and treated him like a child, since he'd been acting like one (and since I have never really been allowed to act like one). Especially after the months of therapy, and of having reconciled over the job issue before, our relationship solidified as much more open, honest, and natural. A year later, I've not stopped communicating my feelings to him, and he's opened up to me as an adult.  


the child-parent relationship between my dad and I was horrible.  Any diary entry from the age of six to... well, nineteen from me, about him, involved dark, hateful, repressed feelings while I reassured his insecurities daily. What's developed now is a very healthy adult-adult relationship. I never thought we'd get along this well, or that I'd look forward to seeing and talking to him. We have great conversations all the time, about work and history (my major, his hobby it turns out) and just petty normal things.  It's wonderful.


I think the keys were: distance, and me having the room to establish my own income and own life.  The difficulty was that I had to forcefully make that room, by acknowledging the issues between us and and deciding to address them (That is where this sub comes in). To everyone here, thank you thank you thank you.

27724,Non-Romantic,3d5r1q,"I am a full time student and I work part time. I live in a house with many of my relatives together. We've each more or less separated the house by family group. The first floor is the domain of my father and I. The second floor is the domain of my grandmother, Aunt A and her husband and my cousin G in question. The third &amp; fourth floor is for Aunt H (cousin G's mother), Aunt B and again my cousin G (he has two bedrooms total).

Because my section of the house has been under renovation for the last 3 months (and counting) I have been eating meals, sharing resources (food and kitchen appliances), and generally spending down time on Aunt H's floor except to shower and sleep.

I don't make a lot of money as I work part time for minimum wages. In contrast cousin G voluntarily has gone on unpaid leave from his job and has extended his absence several times though he has the option to resume working.

Recently he has begun treating my money as our money. Though he hasn't said it as such, he feels as though whenever I go shopping I am to buy groceries for everyone with no recompensation. I don't mind buying one or two items but the last few times I have offered to pay for a few things I ended up spending about $50 dollars each time when I average about $300 a month and after I pay bills for myself I have about $100 left. Unlimited metrocards are expensive.

On top of this it's not as though I eat everything that is available in the fridge. I only eat what I pay for. It's the right thing to do and given that I know he can be petty about anything I didn't want to eat anything that he may claim is his (pretty much anything that is general consumption he claims as his)

Because of this I have decided to take on some of the renovation work myself (my dad has been doing it sorta kinda not really) so I can get back into my own space faster.

He also is on oxycodone, valium, and another heavy narcotic for pain from his disability, and since he was an ER nurse, has the ability to give heavy doses of it. He also drinks somewhat while on these. 

Here is a list of things that have bothered me lately: 

-At my college graduation, did not get me anything and showed up out of obligation. No card, nothing. He was extremely awkward because my mom was there, and his girlfriend acted more cordial than he could. Chastised me for not having everything packed in my apartment, and basically left as soon as the ceremony was over. 

-Right now, I'm across the U.S from him. It takes him at least 3-4 days to get back to me for a phone call when I need his help to decide when I should take a plane back to visit. He sees my texts and does not text back and does not call when I ask him to. 

-In lieu of the previous one, he said he wouldn't be able to pick me up from the airport on his girlfriend's birthday because it's her birthday. Meanwhile, when it was my birthday, he did not call me or wish me a happy birthday until a day later when I messaged him frantically thinking something was wrong because he has NEVER forgotten to wish me a happy birthday before. Again, no card, nothing. 

-We addressed the first issue in therapy, which we have both gone to for many, many years, but he often does not follow through and continues to do the things he says he will fix in therapy. He will be extremely apologetic in therapy, and as we walked out for the first issue, he said he would buy me a macbook for graduation, as that is something I've needed. This was back in June. I sent him an email with the information for the macbook I wanted (the cheapest one) and also said he could get a refurbished one if money was tight. In July, for my birthday, he asked what I wanted. I said the macbook was fine. Just a week ago, he finally looked at the price (1k) and asked if we could split it. I said I didn't have the money for it, and said he could buy me a used one ($500 or so). A week (three months??) later he still hasn't looked at his budget or the used laptop options. 

I had a mental breakdown a year ago because of how up and down his behavior can be- the worst of my life to the point he suspected me suicidal, as he cornered me and told me he would kick me out of his house and everything I thought was mine was actually his. His response to thinking I was suicidal was that he would call the police and have them hold me at gunpoint until I cooperated, and told me it was all a ploy for attention. This was all because he blocked me from seeing a potential job offer, due to 
**one dirty dish being left in the sink.** 

He makes me feel like I'm more of an obligation than him actually wanting to talk to me and be there for me, which makes me...well, really sad. My therapist (different from his own, but used to be his for about ten years until she got too honest for him) told me he might have used me for revenge against my mother. When I turned 21 and child support was done, he might have not had any use for me. 

So, reddit. What are your suggestions? Should I distance myself or keep trying to work with him? And although I feel like it's really selfish, I want to get the laptop he promised me, if anyone has any advice for how to deal with that. 

TL;DR: My dad has changed since he retired from the police force and has become addicted to narcotics. How should I respond to his strange behaviors, such as ignoring my calls for days and acting as though I'm an obligation?

27831,Non-Romantic,2sgwjg,"This is about Stacy, a friend from a grad program (2012-13).  I think it's safe to say we were both each other’s best friends in the program.  We would usually see each other 2-4 times a week to hang out.   Since the program ended in September 2013, Stacy and I moved back to our hometowns and haven’t talked a lot, but we’ve texted or FB-messaged every once in a while, maybe 2-4 conversations a month.  We’ve seen each other in person once, in March 2014 when we planned to be in the same city at the same time.

This past September,  I moved to a city that’s a lot closer to where Stacy lives. Before I moved, we texted a few times, expressing that we missed each other and couldn’t wait to hang out again and maybe go visit a mutual friend in NYC. 

I last heard from her in early November, when she sent a Snapchat of her in bed looking miserable, with the caption ‘miss u boo’ (or similar). I responded with a Snapchat that she never viewed, and that’s the last I heard from her.  Since then I have texted her twice (over a month apart) and Facebook messaged her twice. My messages grew increasingly worried, from ‘What are you doing for Christmas? Come visit and let’s go skiing!’ to (most recently, a few weeks ago) straight-up asking, ‘WTF?? Are you okay?!’  I don't want to sound crazy in my messages, but it's weirding me out! She hasn’t even seen the Facebook messages. I’ve also included her on a few group Snapchats here and there that she’s never viewed. 

As far as I can tell, Stacy was inactive on Facebook from the first week of November until November 28th, when she was tagged in a photo.  There are a few posts on her wall, but she did not like or comment on any of them, even though she normally does.  Since Thanksgiving, she has posted a couple photos and most recently, a status on December 24th. 

I know I am a huge worrywart, and I am trying not to be weird/obsessive about this.  But even for Stacy, who is bad at staying in touch, this is unusual.  I know she has had a tough time since moving back home: she doesn't have a car, she's found it very difficult to find a job, and I know she struggles with self-harm and low self-esteem generally.  It was strange for her to say ‘I miss you’ out of the blue and then become uncontactable.  It was strange for her to be absent from Facebook for three weeks.  But… it’s also strange for her to be posting on FB without having even seen my messages or texted me.  So maybe she wants me to fuck off?

On the one hand, Stacy has straight-up told that she has a hard time maintaining long-distance friendships; she mentioned college friends complaining about it, and she’s a notoriously bad texter (though she eventually responds with apologies).  Also, if Stacy is in a difficult place and does not want or need my support, I should respect that.  If Stacy simply does not want to maintain our friendship, I should respect that.

On the other hand, I care about her a lot.  I consider(ed) her to me one of my best friends, and I am concerned.

I have considered messaging one of her good friends from college, whom I have met and got along with, just to check in on Stacy. But I don’t want to be a creep.  I could also try texting her one more time [ed: or calling! novel idea]. Thoughts on what I should do? Is it my place to butt in here, or should I let the friendship die?

A lot of raw nerves were tugged on in our fight, and we have not talked to each other since. Aaron comes home to sleep, and is out the rest of the day. It's reminding me of the fights my father and I used to have, which is not good.

I want to apologize to him for what I said during the argument, but I don't know if I should apologize about not telling him about Laura's death. I don't even know how to begin the Laura conversation, as I still have nightmares over it.

27852,Non-Romantic,3h9gfz,"Hey everyone! First time posting something so personal but I really need your advice! 

**TL;DR:** Parents don't approve/accept my interracial relationship which has resulted in tension in the house, and been the major cause of my depression/anxiety. Any advice would be much loved. 

So, I'm an upper year uni student and I live with my parents since the campus is only a half hour drive away. We immigrated to Canada when I was five and we've been here since. I met my boyfriend three and a half years ago at uni and we've been together for almost three years now. He lives with roommates so he doesn't have to handle it on a day-to-day basis.

I used to talk about him a lot to my parents when I first met him and even for a while after we started going out. My mom eventually figured out that we were in a relationship and kept pestering me to admit to it until I finally did. This didn't go too well. Right away she stated her opinion on the whole thing and how it goes against her wishes and how she and my father wish I had never met him. 

I understand they have certain expectations of me (they are my parents after all), and I've tried to be really patient and tried to explain to them that race isn't an issue for me and it shouldn't be for them either. Ideally, they would have me married off in the next year with someone they've found and approve of. Of course, since the beginning of high school I'd stated my views on arranged marriage and how that wasn't for me. Okay. Fair. So next best thing for them would be me finding a nice Indian man on my own (whom they approve of). 

I've told them that is not going to happen as long as I'm with my current SO. My mother got so upset with this that she even asked me to get back together with my ex who was Guyanese (and whom she had told me to break up with when I told her about him). 

But, for the last year and a half this constant tension in my house has been affecting me really badly. Last fall, I had an anxiety attack during finals and ended up having exams for that term postponed because I was just too unstable. That persisted for a while so I sought counselling and a doctor and have been on medication for depression, anxiety, and obsessive thoughts for about eight months now. 

I'd have to say that roughly 80% of my encounters with my parents these days turn into arguments. Why? Because they don't like me seeing my SO, so I have to lie to get out of the house, which creates more lies and I feel bad. So...I get depressed and they ask why and I can't tell them because I don't want to hurt them by saying they're the ones who hurt me. Let me clarify that I'm not over exaggerating when I say I have to lie to get out of the house all the time. It's gotten to the point where I leave the house first thing in the morning around eight, and don't get home until after eight or nine in the evening. I constantly make up excuses (gym, work, studying, etc.) to be out so I don't have to interact with them. 

But all these small white lies to get out of the house, and arguments over the smallest things...it's gotten to the point where I had to take the last eight months off from school because I just couldn't handle the situation at home. It's been affecting my work (and I only work part time in retail) where I often call in sick because I'm just too depressed to get out of bed. Even this post I'm typing in the bathroom with the shower on to cover my crying. I feel so suffocated. 

Here's some examples of things that have happened:
Last year, I booked a hotel room for me, my SO and some of friends to hang out the night of my birthday. My parents don't approve of drinking or clubbing so this is what I have to resort to. I had told them I'm staying over at a friend's. The next morning, my mother called me and demanded that I come home because they wanted to spend time with me on my birthday. I didn't come home right away because I told her I wouldn't until after lunch. Anyway, I got home when I told her I'd be home (ready to celebrate my birthday and all), but instead I came home to an empty house and a note telling me to clean the bathroom. 

Another, more recent, conversation included my mother emotionally blackmailing me by telling me I should be careful what choices I make because my paternal grandfather died of a heart attack relatively early in life and the same could happen to my father if I'm not careful. (Basically, she thinks I'm going to give my dad a heart attack because I love a Chinese man). 

The biggest fight we had included my mother threatening to not let me do my Master's, her regret for having moved to Canada and lost me to Western culture, threatening to send me AND my younger brother back to India (because that will fix everything), accusing me of hating them, and her disappointment in my life choices.

Now, I should say that, despite all this, I do love my parents. I don't like them much, but I do love them. And I don't want to hurt them. But I want to them to at least accept the fact that I have such a wonderful man in my life. 

If you have any suggestions or tips on how to handle this situation better or links to resources that could help, I'd really appreciate it. Any support at this point would be like a ray of sunshine.

My friend (Josh) and I have gotten along really well despite small disagreements here and there in the past. However, recently there's been a couple of occurrences where the issue persists and we cut contact for a period of time. I'll tell you about the most recent situation and you can ask me questions if you'd like about anything else. 

Josh hooked up with a girl (Sarah) less than two months ago (they knew each other in high school as well) and he took her out Thursday night. He called me yesterday afternoon saying he had an emergency. I told him I would be on the way. When I got there I asked him what was wrong and he told me that Sarah was freaking out because they didn't use any protection (Josh said he pulled out) last night. I was surprised and joked around with him on the way to pick Sarah up. I drove them to the nearest drug store so they could get plan B. I parked and said something along the lines of Alright, I'll let you two love birds do your thing. After dropping her off, Josh said he didn't appreciate me calling them love birds because he didn't want Sarah to get the wrong idea. I said it was a joke and didn't mean to be a dick. 

We were supposed to go to the gym together right after. He told me I wasn't taking the situation seriously and to see it from his side. He was worried that Sarah wouldn't see him anymore because she wouldn't trust Josh again. My reply was that he shouldn't jump the gun so quickly to assume the worst case scenario (I'm a realistic optimist..). Maybe the stress was getting to him via Sarah, I dunno. We argued back and forth, got to the change rooms and he said he didn't feel like it anymore. He went upstairs before me and I got a text from him 10 minutes later saying 'thanks for the help, could you throw away the package (plan b) in the car. I got a ride home'. 

I told him sure and I'll take a rain check on tonight (we had plans last night). In hindsight I really should have called him out on his shit, he should have been prepared before that night he took Sarah out. At least get her plan B in the morning (he had a driving test the morning after anyway) instead of waiting for her to freak about it and then doing something. It's 2014, if you're going to pull out at least use plan B just to make sure. That's what the hell it's there for..but I digress. We *were* close friends (I'd rather salvage the friendship and distance ourselves) and although I have a really cool temper, Josh gets angry and stays angry so I was most likely avoiding that.

27923,Non-Romantic,3efyzi,"My SO and I (together for 7 years) moved to a metropolitan city three years ago and have become close with a group of friends, all of whom were very close before my SO and I came along. Most of these friends are great people and we adore them, but there is this one couple in the group (together for five years) who I'm no longer a fan of. Yet EVERYONE else thinks the girl can do no wrong, even after knowing everything below.

The girl of said couple, lets call her Marie, and I were getting pretty close about a year and a half ago. Her SO (Jeff) and my SO (Zack) also got pretty close as well. We would go out for coffee, dinners, etc and bring our SOs and it seemed like the four of us were becoming best friends and I decided to go with Marie to a barcrawl, just us two since the boys were out of town. Well, long story short, I caught Marie making out with a random guy. I was so upset, I thought her and Jeff were such a wonderful couple and I couldn't believe I caught her cheating. I ended up confronting her about it the next day, saying I'm not sure what I saw and I didn't want to say anything, I just love you and Jeff together!. She said she didn't remember what happened and she was sorry about what I thought I saw, so I ended up dropping it because I'm not going to be the one to stir up anything. 

After that, I started finding out so many bad things about Marie...she'd cheat on Jeff all the time because she could. Even with another guy in the friend group! When I found that out, I noticed that said friend and Jeff never would talk and would avoid each other. I'm pretty sure Jeff knows, and just loves her too much to let her go. But who knows? Maybe they have some open relationship or something. 

I started separating myself from Marie and would focus on my other friends instead. When we would run into each other, I would feign excitement and would force myself to be friendly. When Jeff proposed to Marie earlier this year, I texted her congrats and was genuinely excited for her...hoping that she would start to become a better person?

The straw that broke the camels back was two months ago when the friend group was at a wedding of a different couple in the group (confusing, I know!). Marie and I were talking and she started getting all excited saying she knows a secret that she wants to tell me. I said to tell me, and she proceeds to say how my SO went to the same jeweler that designed the brides ring a few weeks ago....my jaw dropped. How could she have ruined that for me! I NEVER would've done that to anyone I knew, no matter what!!

I haven't seen or spoken to her since then, I'm still so mad that I'm not sure I would be able to fake anything around her. My SO knows she told me (so does the rest of the friend group) and he's not happy either but he doesn't hold onto grudges, so he stopped caring about it. Jeff told my SO that their wedding was going to be a small one in a foreign country, and due to Jeff and him still being close, my SO is hoping that we are invited. I was straightforward and told him that I hope we are not invited because I do not want to spend the money on flights/hotels/gifts for them since everything has happened with Marie and I. 

What if we are invited to the wedding? I don't want to make my SO feel awkward since he's still good friends with Jeff, but I seriously cannot stand Marie. What do I say to her, if anything, when I finally see her (which is bound to happen)?

Okay, so I was meant to be seeing my friend Alice [18F] at some point today, but she texted me Saturday morning to say that she was going out for a meal with one of our mutual friends Sarah [19F], and a girl I went to school with Andrea [20F]. Alice thought it would be a good idea to kill two birds with one stone and have us all meet up so that she could free up Monday, meaning she could work extra shifts to save some money for an upcoming holiday. I thought great, since I hadn't seen Andrea in about 2 years and it would be nice to catch up a bit.

Now, the thing is, I didn't know Andrea that well when I was at school. She was someone I'd see in between classes and say hi, or maybe chat with at lunch a bit. Nothing more. She was a really nice, quiet girl and we got on well, but I thought of her as more of an acquaintance. During our exam time in our final year, she suffered from a type of brain injury where she was put into a medical coma in March and didn't wake up until mid April. I may have got some of the details wrong and this is all I really know since, like I said, I didn't really know her that well and heard this from a friend. I was saddened as I knew how nice she was, and we were all worried for her. I heard bits and pieces from different people who went to visit her when she woke up, saying that because of her injury her personality had completely changed and she now seemed to lack a verbal filter, and was very outspoken. I was glad that she had pulled through, and it kind of slipped to the back of my mind until I was invited for dinner with her.

So, I got to the restaurant and my 2 friends were already there, we chatted for a bit, and then Andrea arrived. From the moment she sat down to the moment I dropped her off at her house, she was just  constantly speaking, as in my friends and I only said about a few sentences each over the course of about 4 hours. I'm a very quiet person myself and I can struggle when it comes to very in-your-face people (something I'm working on) so I was very much exhausted within about 30 minutes of this. But I thought hey, it's not her fault, I'll be as polite as possible. The topics of conversation weren't exactly appropriate for a group of people you don't know well, and she glossed over a lot of horrible experiences she has had like they meant nothing. She also talked a lot of shit about one of my closest friends, and I was very taken aback and just tried to change the topic of conversation. It was all a little jarring but again, I didn't want to be rude to her for something she can't help.

At one point during her talking she turned to me abruptly and asked what I was doing the next day so I replied, nothing. She then erupted into oh we should do something, we could do x, y, z..., and I had no idea how to respond. I felt extremely bad, but I couldn't see myself being comfortable one to one with her, so I kinda just avoided it and she continued on talking about something completely different and I thought I'd gotten away with it. I was wrong. She brought it up again, so I made up an excuse of I'm really sorry, I've just remembered I need to go and visit my grandma tomorrow so I'll probably be busy most of the day. She said okay and moved on. She them brought it up AGAIN and the conversation went a bit like:

A: What time are you going to see her?
Me: I'm not really sure, I'll have to check with my mom when I get back.
A: Could you call her and ask her?
Me: Well she has work early tomorrow so she'll be in bed... (note: this was at about 10pm and my mom gets up for work about 5am)
A: Well, could you do it in the early morning or the evening so we could do something?
Me: Umm I'm really not sure. I think I'll be busy for most of the day anyway.
A: Could I just come with you to see her?
Me: ...I'm not really sure my mom would be okay with that.

She bounced the conversation back to what we were going to do the next day at least 6 times and every time I said I was really sorry but I was unable to. Then as she was getting out of my car at her house she said her goodbyes and oh, see you tomorrow Lily!. What. No. I was so infuriated at this point but she'd already closed the door and started walking to her house before I could reiterate AGAIN that I couldn't. She must've had my number from God knows how long ago (probably about 6 years, I haven't changed my number since I first got a phone) and she proceeded to text me 3 times as soon as I got home (at about 11pm), sent me 3 Facebook messages at 1am (waking me up) all saying how she was looking forward to tomorrow. I wasn't in any mood to reply so I chose to wait until the next day to reply to her. She then woke me up at 9am with 3 more texts, a phone call, and another text asking me to get in touch with her. In what was not my finest hour, I didn't reply to her until about 12pm saying - for what felt like the millionth time - the same thing I'd been saying to her constantly, that I was too busy and I was sorry. She seemed to accept it and she left me alone for the day. She has now messaged me about 4 times asking for various contact details (Skype, snapchat, etc.) and I haven't replied to any of these, because I really feel like she can't respect personal space (which I accept is something she cannot control) and all of this attention makes me extremely uncomfortable. I don't want to give in and give her false hopes that I'll become really good friends with her or something, but I also don't want to be horrible to her because it isn't exactly her fault that she's like this. What should I do?

TL;DR went to dinner with friends and an acquaintance I hadn't seen in about 2 years. She proceeded to talk constantly for 4 hours, repeatedly tried to make plans with me despite me saying I couldn't and has pushed my boundaries by texting and calling at inappropriate times. I haven't replied and don't want to hurt her feelings or give her false hope. How do I remedy this situation?

**Background:** I grew up in a toxic home situation, something that I am only just coming to terms with fully and working through in therapy (I normalized a lot of it as I was fairly isolated, but I have seen it impact my professional life and future so I'm finally admitting that a lot of the things I excused or took responsibility for were actually probably abusive). It isn't easy. 

I now live in a different city then most of my family, but they frequently call/text/expect me to come home on holidays. Most of the issues do relate to my mother, who is controlling and possibly emotionally/verbally abusive, but my sister is a contributor as well. I was depressed this fall after ending a controlling, abusive friendship, and have been working in therapy to sort through and address a lot of personal issues. 

**About my Sister:** She has some very serious physical health issues which have impacted her seriously throughout her life, and which my parents have actively tried to assist her with. In part because of these she has severe anxiety issues, including separation anxiety, difficulty regulating her emotions, and eating concerns as well. I have tried to be a good big sister--I know I haven't always succeeded, but I try. But I think I've reached my limit.

**Breaking Point** I had a horrible thanksgiving break. A number of things went terribly wrong, but the incident in question has to do with my sister. Long story short I struggled with depression this fall, and it impacted my focus in class (I'm in a highly competitive professional program). I've worked through a lot of it, but finals was emotionally triggering because I realized how much my depression had impacted my learning, and how much material I had to make up for exams. I was visibly upset and talking to my father one evening about this exam stress, and my sister kept throwing nasty comments my way from the seat next to me (example; I said to my dad that I just feel like I don't know anything about XXX subject--I'm going to have to relearn everything on it and my sister pipes in from the side do you ever know anything about anything?). I admit I should have just ignored it or walked away, but I didn't: I was emotionally raw from exams and dealing with my mother (she had tried to kick me out because of an argument about my sexuality two days before), and the comments wouldn't stop--I finally snapped and turned to my sister and growled could you just shut up!. And she threw herself at me. Punched me hard clear across the jaw and kept coming. I fought back, and apparently drew blood (not intentional--I was trying to fend her off and I do keep my nails long). But it was like this rabid beast just hitting me.

Once I got away I went to my old bedroom to hide, nursing my jaw and crying (pretty sure my jaw was sprained--couldn't move it properly for about 5 days, and the inside of my lip was all cut up from my teeth). Course, my room doesn't have a lock, so next thing I know I have my parents and brother in there yelling at me that I drew blood on my sister, and I shouldn't have provoked her, etc... I'm just sitting there sobbing, feeling all of 10 years old, trying to defend myself, but all I could do was just repeat over and over she hit me first! She hit me first! *EDIT: I realize that my whole exam stress-response was possibly dramatic--I didn't mean it that way at all--just going through my notes and realizing how little I remembered from class kinda triggered memories from the start of the semester when I was trying to pull myself out of a severe depression (like couldn't get out of bed some days bad), and I just felt really lost and sad. Doing really well academically has always been heavily prioritized in my family, and after everything this fall the realization that there just wasn't any way I could do well, and that my GPA would drop on top of everything this fall just felt like a punch in the gut. I was trying to talk through some of this stress with my father at the time*

Finally they left me alone, and I just basically hid for the rest of break. My sister never apologized--just went back to being sickening sweet-texting things like you go on your finals! you got this! I miss you! I love you! etc.

Should I have snapped at her to shut up? No. That was childish, but the fact remains that my 20-yr-old sister's response was to *punch me*. And not just one punch but a fully-body attack. 

I wish I could say that this is the first time that this has happened, my sister punching me. It isn't. It doesn't happen often, in no small part because we live on other sides of the country, but my sister does get physically aggressive on occasion. One particular time when she was 17 and I was 22 she had a full blown panic-attack freak-out, screaming at my parents and threatening to kill herself until my dad had to leave he was so hurt by the things she said, while my mom hid with my baby sister in the other end of the house. I refused to leave my middle sister alone, and when she started to try and hurt herself with things in her room I removed them, at which point she physically threw herself at me, punching/clawing/etc. Ended up having to take her to the ground and just sit on her, trying to hold her arms and legs still. I took a bit of a beating (split lip, two black eyes, sore ribs), but she eventually calmed down and stopped screaming about suicide, so I counted it as a win.

I know my sister has troubles. I have tried to help--she wouldn't call her student counseling center this fall due to anxiety, so I offered (and did) call for her, setting up and appointment etc. She went once and never went back. I asked her a few times, and she was always like I'm too busy. I was frustrated with that, but let it go. Also she is very obsessed with a crush of hers, and constantly is texting me about it. I try and be a supportive voice of reason, and generally it seems to be okay. However, she accidentally sent a text to our parents meant for me that revealed her interest in this man to them, and when they called to ask she texted/called me and just exploded. From my perspective it was just out of be blue--texts and voice mails about how I was a liar and untrustworthy and horrible etc. Eventually sorted out what had actually happened (took a bit of a terse call to my parents on my part, and one to her), but still--she didn't ask at all at first if I had shared (I hadn't), just immediately started verbally attacking me. 

I know I have my own issues. I am generally pretty chill, but when overwhelmed emotionally I do tend to snap in anger. Basically I try and be a calm rock, but I don't know what to do with strong emotions, so tend to isolate and turn them against myself, or, if not allowed to isolate, I get mad and snarl at people around me. I am working with a therapist on this though. However I have never raised a hand against anyone since I was a young, stupid kid (preteen squabbles are hilarious). I will fight back if attacked, but I don't throw physical punches, and it does take me a bit to throw verbal ones. 

My sister though is like a walking powder keg. And though when we are apart she is always crying about how much she misses her family and how mean everyone is, when she is with us it honestly feels like she can only find self worth by constantly tearing into me and my other siblings. For a long time I've relied on my parent's to help her, as I've been out of the house for school/adulthood. However their reaction this thanksgiving--to put the blame for the fight not on her for punching me, but me for snapping and provoking her--has destroyed that belief that they can help her. 

At this point she is 20 and these angry physical outburst just aren't okay any more--I don't care what her issues are. I can't take it any more. I don't want to see her. I don't respond to her texts, not since Thanksgiving. I just cant do this.

If I call the cops on her it will damage her future. She would probably lose her athletic scholarship, which would force her to drop out of college, and a felony would appear on her permanent record, and affect her ability to get jobs/grad school/etc. But... Thing is, my sister is a big, powerful woman, who is very athletic and *very* strong. Her punches *hurt*. And what happens when she starts dating someone and he pisses her off? Or when she has a kid and they make her mad?

I'm thinking I'll inform her that if she strikes me again I will call the cops on her, so she knows that her actions will have consequences. But I'm also concerned about my ability to follow through. And I'm pretty sure if I did that my relationship with my family would end permanently. I just don't know what to do anymore at this point.

However I have a big issue with her. She can't take anything negative, gets mean, and can't see how other people view things. For example if I say something like can you help clean this she will freak out and say I fucking guess I will since you won't. And I'll be like why are you being so mean? She will say I'm not and I didn't intend it to be that way. And I say will it came across mean to me. She will say something like whatever.

27965,Non-Romantic,3132ze,"My best friend, we’ll call her Alice, and I have been friends for a decade, and we’ve been inseparable for most of it. We’ve never had large arguments, just small disagreements, none of which were cause for any conflict, until now. Prepare for a novel.
Now before I go on my tirade I don’t claim to be perfect, I have my own flaws, I used to not be the most kind person on the face of the planet, but I’ve grown up, done some soul searching and like to pride myself on being at least mostly level headed, and empathetic to the motivations that drive people to do the things they do, and generally seeing things from the other persons perspective. Recently I’ve had a lot of things happen in my personal and work life that have prevented me from being as there as I normally might be for everyone around me, and for the most party they understand that I need to focus on me, but I still realize that I could probably be a little more… sympathetic than I have been, not that I’ve just been cold and callous, but not as poor baby hug hug hug as I might normally be.

For context I was involved in a play that Alice drug me to the audition for and begged me to try out for. We both got some pretty good parts. Theatre is the fire that fuels my soul, and feeds my passion. Alice claims to have the same drive to it as I do.
The real trouble started just a few weeks ago, a month absolutely tops. Alice is lacksidaisical at rehearsal, which I mostly understand given that she too has some woes particularly in the job market, I get it. She doesn’t get the job she had her heart set on, and is fairly upset about it. This is where I could have been more compassionate, but I’m also going through job woes and don’t have a crazy amount of sympathy about it, as neither of us have had much luck, and I know I’ve been applying everywhere, I don’t know about her. Anyways she gets injured at her part time job, and is in quite a bit of pain, we thing she tore a muscle. And again, I probably could have shown a little more compassion about it, but I’ve got my own things and offer to help her with whatever she needs etc, I try to be there for her as much as I can allow myself to be. 

Because of her injury she calls out of rehearsal a couple times, fair. Then she shows up one day and is off her rocker from her meds and is just totally out of it, doesn’t know lines, or cues, not paying any attention, basically it would have been easier on us if she’d just stayed home again. Then she does it again several more times, the times she’s there she’s mentally checked out, or she’s called out. It becomes irritating because I’d sprained my ankle not but a couple weeks before, and didn’t miss a single rehearsal or show up out of my gourd, but again we all deal with things differently so even though it bothers me I drop it.

She then goes on this war path about a business that I’d been running at one point, selling hand painted shoes, I’d done me research on what I was doing well before trying to start selling them. Everything from price vs. time to the brand of the shoe and paints I use etc. Out of the blue she starts telling me about how I need to buy cheaper shoes (firstly no, I will stick with my quality product) and how I need to use fabric pens instead of the paints I use (also no, as the versatility is almost completely gone.) and continues for at least an hour putting everything very condescendingly and matter-of-factly, and explaining to me why I didn’t sell that much. Basically rubbing in my face points I already knew, and being rude about it, and offering “helpful suggestions” but ones that lower the quality of my product, and then tells me how I can only do this for fun and not for profit, and how she’d run my store for me, when I told her fine do that she demanded a cut.

Fast forward about a week, she tries to call out of rehearsal again, a week and a half before opening night, due to “family dinner.” Liz, our director, then tells her that isn’t a valid excuse to miss a rehearsal, (by the way we signed contracts stating that we would not miss more than x number of rehearsals.) and that her family should understand her previous, contracted, engagements and commitments. And I agreed with it whole heartedly, at this point I’ve put in as much effort as possible, and she hasn’t bothered really doing anything. Liz isn’t particularly tactful and said a couple other things that didn’t make much sense, and could have done without, and in the past she’s said some pretty rude things to myself. So when Alice shows up she goes on and on about how Liz is a bitch, and I tell her sure she lacks tact on occasion, but don’t agree with her statement. Liz’s husband, Mark, is also involved and made plans for the same night months in advanced, so obviously he’s let free to do his prior plans. Alice is complaining about how if he’s able to do what he wants then she should too. When she looks to me for commiseration I tell her that he did make plans before the show even started. I said this because I didn’t agree with her and I wasn’t going to sacrifice my moral compass and call someone undeserving a jerk because she didn’t like not getting her way, but I wasn’t trying to make her feel like I was against her either.
That night some really nut crap went down for me and long story short I got my heart and soul shattered, and made a drastic decision to move and go back to school. (Thankfully it turned out to be something way different than I thought and all was well, but that’s another story and I didn’t find out for days after the damage had been done.) I show up to our bar and I’m crushed and inconsolable, and she shows up after another interview, she is sympathetic but gives me this “I told you so” attitude. I let it slide as she’s listening to me without actually literally saying anything to further upset me. Until she demands an apology for my not taking her side against Liz and Mark for the previous night, and how she felt like I wasn’t supportive, and she just wanted me to give her the poor baby it’ll be okay thing and call them dicks with her. I refuse as I don’t believe my actions were in the wrong at all. Instead I apologize for her taking my statements as her feeling I was against her, as it wasn’t my intent. She tells me that’s good enough.

She then proceeds to banter for an hour about how it’s my responsibility to make sure that her insecurities are kept at bay by constantly reassuring her that she’s good enough, smart enough, pretty enough etc. Which is ridiculous, and I tell her so, as nicely and politely as I can and tell her that I will continue to compliment her as I usually do but she needs to take that responsibility on for herself, and then give her words of encouragement and that sort of self help mumbo jumbo. 

There was something else she did but I can’t remember right off, that irked me but I let go. We head to rehearsal. I’m in contact with an up and coming celebrity, from our favorite show, and he’s very supportive of my artwork, and commissioned a pair of shoes previously. We keep in touch somewhat regularly, and that night happened to be one of those nights we were in contact, he then commissioned another pair from me, and I share this with her as it’s exciting and we share almost everything. She quickly gets nosy and demands to know what’s being said as she sees me texting him back and forth. And It just made me uncomfortable, it was nothing important or worth reporting so I brushed it off and said nothing. To which she got mad at me for because I wasn’t forking over details freely. Then she gets mad at me, and I do mean legitimately mad, because I was not talking to him, about her enough. I was floored, and didn’t even know how to respond, so I again brushed it off. He then sends me an address to send the shoes and I suspect it may have been his personal address and tell her that. She demands his address. And I immediately tell her no, because it’s not my information to share, and have to explain this to her for almost half an hour. Then I try to move on by joking about how if I did tell her and it got out I’d know who to blame, she then says “what you don’t trust me?” And she said this seriously. So I reiterate my point that I can’t give her his address because it’s his personal info that he’s trusted me with.
She then goes on about how if she were talking to whoever then she’d talk about me all the time and how she’d tell me everything. And so I told her if she wanted to talk to him to reach out and just do it. Then she says he doesn’t want to talk to her and a few other things that came off very “if he doesn’t want to talk to me then why would he talk to you?” It comes to a head when I tell her that this jealousy thing she’s doing has to stop. Nothing more that night.

The next day she comes by, to my dismay, and apologizes for her crazy, we both do some apologizing, mine being that I haven’t been as supportive or compassionate as I should be, and her for acting like a turd. We forgive each other and move on with our lives. She still does a few things that bother me but nothing serious enough to warrant talking about.

Opening night comes and goes and our performances are over, and I get a glowing review by numerous people. Including our parents, the director, some of the other actors and a couple other people. And I’m feeling pretty damn good about myself. I look good, I’m being noticed a bit more, getting my talents recognized. She’s been complaining for several weeks now that x many people want to be my friend and that I’m getting compliments left and right, I try to stifle her jealousy and build her up, like a good friend. But after opening night it went to hell. She gives me some passive aggressive comments about other people saying good things about me and how she’s not hearing any of that for herself. At this point I know, without her telling me, she regrets getting me involved in the show. 

The next day is the day of the cast party, I decide not to go as I quit my job, and am low on funds, and don’t want to waste gas by driving an hour to and from the party. Alice asks if I’m going I tell her likely not, she asks me to call her if I decide to go. Sure. I dye my hair instead. She texts me and asks how the party is going, and I respond with “Don’t know, I’m not there.” Then she proceeds to tell me how the fellow actor hosting the party contacted her to ask if I was going, she didn’t have my number. And tells me the actress wants to be my friend so badly. I joke around with her about it. Then she tells me that she was attempting to nap when her father came over and started taking about how talented I am, and then actress texts her asking if I’m going to the cast party, and not her, then she complains that I’m being talked about so much that she’s going to go hide. And that was it. I had it.
I snapped, and I could have been more tactful and less aggressive but I couldn’t stand it anymore. I’ve been bearing the brunt of her passive aggressiveness because she doesn’t like that other people want to be my friend and are happy for me, and paying attention to me, and that her getting pissy with me over things that are outside of my control makes me feel like shit and that she feels she’s better than I am and so on.

She then gets defensive, of course, and brushes me off saying she has no idea where I get that idea from and that she just doesn’t like being ignored. Mind you she’s never been one to be ignored. EVER. She’s petite, beautiful, smart, hilarious, charismatic, awkward and endearing, she’s bright and sweet, and 90% of the people we come into contact with prefer her company over mine, which I totally understand. She’s fun! And I’m the fat friend with the bitch face. (I’m not actually fat I’m just more filled out when t comes to my… ahem assets, and taller, but she’s teeny tiny so in comparison, I feel like Shamu next to a Shrimp.) But I’m a bit more no nonsense, blunt dry sarcasm, it’s very much a Leslie Knoppe, and April Ludgate pairing. I let her know that she’s never ignored and that I feel this way because she’s done nothing but bitch and complain and make me feel like crap for having even the smallest amount of attention placed on me.

I tell her to take care of herself and that I’d talk to her soon. As I didn’t want to talk to her while I was so angry and say something I’d regret and make matters worse by working off of rage and impulse rather than logic and reason.

THEN TODAY HAPPENS. And she demands to meet up and talk, even though I tell her no, she shows up, drunk off her ass, and tells me “come on lets hash this shit out.” And proceeds to repeat her previous statements, as do I, then she claims I’m dismissive of her using the example that I wouldn’t tell her what to get a 4 year old for their birthday, as it was her choice and I didn’t much care what she got the kid one way or the other. Then she bring sup my Celebrifriend and how I don’t talk about her to anyone enough, but she talks about me all the time. Which, fine, if you want me to be your main topic of conversation that’s fine, but I’ve got a thousand things I want to talk about, and maybe she’d be one of them. She was offended that I don’t reciprocate the talking about her as much as she allegedly does me. And how I make fun of her for everything. Which isn’t entirely a lie but it’s not true either. It’s usually things like “omg you’re such a nerd, learning math and shit, you go smarty pants.” Which I don’t personally take as an insult or making fun of per say but rather in jest while simultaneously building her up. I mean we’re fucking friends that’s what friends do, they make fun of each other in the best ways possible. And she asks me to name one thing that I’ve not made fun of her for, and I’m so caught off guard with this that it throws me and I don’t answer, because again the example I gave is how I “make fun” of her, or “ugh you’re so pretty it hurts.” And she goes “hard isn’t it?” 

Then she tells me that I’ve been mean to her for 10 years, which clearly means I haven’t been nice to her for 10 years. Forgetting that I took her out for a 100$ dinner for her birthday full birthday package, and then took her to a party she originally didn’t want to go to. Why not you ask? Because a friend of ours had a birthday the same day and everyone was throwing him a surprise party, and she was upset that she wasn’t getting one. So I called and organized them to jump out and yell surprise for her too when we got there. Never mind that and the shit ton of other things of equal niceness and consideration I’ve ever done I’m a terrible friend. To top it all off like a spoiled brat throwing a temper tantrum she blocked me on facebook. Which is far more amusing than it is upsetting.

Sooooo needless to say I’m at a loss for what to do, and I really don’t want to be around her, at least not for a while, till I’m not so livid, and don’t flip out at the sight of her face. Because right now I will. Is this worth attempting to salvage? What have I done? I’m not basking in my own glory and shoving it in her face, it just seems that my existence has royally pissed her off, and that fact that people like that I exist now makes it worse.

I'm trying to take this and be as level headed about it as I possibly can, and admittedly the last 2 times we spoke I let my anger get the best of me, I didn't say anything to hurt her or intentionally cut her down, but I could have had more tact in how the subject was broached. I don't claim to be flawless, and I am sorry for how abrasive I was, but I also refuse to apologize because I don't feel like I'm in the wrong. Am I in the wrong? Is there something I'm missing? Should I just let it go? Will putting distance between us be the right thing to do? Should I even want to try to salvage the relationship? I guess I'm just looking for some insight on what the best thing to do is, and if there's something in this that I'm just missing that pieces together the big picture, because she's clearly not okay, but I have no idea why. Or why she's decided to take all of this out on me. And it's just me, none of our other friends have had any issues with her in a similar sense.

TL;DR: My best friend is pissed off because people like me and want to be friends with me, instead of her. Jealousy issues, potentially feels like she’s better than I am. Taking things out on me that I can do nothing about, and I have no idea why, or where this is coming from. I don't know what happened to my friend but I'd like her back. Well... sort of.

27970,Non-Romantic,35xl5d,"I love my father dearly, he is a kind, gentle, sweet man. He and my mother have been divorced since I was a kid, and he dated my step mother for a few years before marrying her 2 years ago. 


I thought my step mother was a nice person, I got along with her very well, I was supportive of their marriage and involved in their lives.


We were all shocked and devastated 3 months ago when she got test results saying that she had an inoperable brain tumour. Stage 4, terminal. The doctors told her and my father not to expect much more than 12 months. My step mother was brave and told everyone the news herself, I cried for days, my father was a mess, we were all grief stricken.


Overnight she changed. It didn't start slowly, I would call around (as I often do) to hear her hurling abuse at my father. The first few times I was shocked but I understood in a way, she was angry and was lashing out at those she loved best. She would go out of her way to be lovely to everyone around her, but was increasingly cruel to my father. It made me uncomfortable, and as it got worse, it made me angry. 


She began to sabotage her medication, incorrectly telling him what the doctor had told her to take, then screaming abuse at him that her had overdosed her and had him rush her to emergency, blaming him all the while that they were in there. I met them at emergency one night and he was heartbroken that he had got her medication wrong, he kept telling her that it was a mistake and that he was sure she had told him what he had given her. Her response was that she had a brain tumor, she couldn't remember anything, he was stupid and useless. This has happened three times that I know about. I have urged him to get a nurse to administer her medication, I don't know if he has.


My father has suffered from sleep disorders his whole life, and often gets too little sleep. My step mother will nap during the day, then wake him several times throughout the night because she needs something or can't sleep. As a result he is sleep deprived and exhausted.


I can't call in anymore, my father started by turning me away at the front door, saying that it wasn't a good time. I understood the first few times and made a point of calling before I dropped around, and if I do drop around, the door is very rarely answered.


My calls in the last few weeks have gone mostly unanswered, my father will call or answer when he is not with my stepmother, which is rarely. My stepmother though will call me regularly, asking for favours or help with something work wise, and will be very bright and happy on the phone, if I ask to come around or speak to my father, she completely ignores my questions or abruptly hangs up. 


I know their housekeeper, who has contacted me more than once, concerned with how my father was being treated. I don't know what to do, he says that he just has to endure it, she has no other family at all, both of her parents are deceased, and any distant relatives live interstate. There is no one else to care for her, and he loves her very much, but he is a shell of the person he was 3 months ago, but I fear for his health and mental well being.

My entire life, my brother has always gotten all the attention. It seems obvious my mother favorites him over me. Growing up, whenever he had any sort of issue, it was catered to immediately. If he felt depressed, he saw a psychiatrist, if he was overweight, my mother took him to a nutritionist, if he was failing in school, he got tutoring. My mom even paid for his two years of community college whereas I had to take out loans for my university. When he got a arrested, my mom got him a lawyer.


Now, I still live at home and go to school full-time. I also was fortunate enough to find a part-time job over the summer that I can keep throughout the school year. My brother also lives at home and works part-time in a factory. My mother works full-time but is severely underemployed and makes just enough to support the household but that's about it.


Now, recently we  decided we had to give up our internet and cable package because it was too expensive. Normally, this is okay with me because I spend a lot of my time in the library at school. However, ever since we turned off the internet, my brother has been starting horrendous fights with my mom and I every day that he wants the internet turned back on. My brother is about 6'2'' - 300 lbs and he will cower over us and yell about this nonstop. It's getting to a point where it's affecting my mental health. He's really becoming abusive about this. At one point, he ever threatened suicide. I'm not sure how to take him because he does have a history of mental illness.


I decided recently that I want to go ahead and get myself a cheap internet package. I am going to need it because school is starting and sometimes I do need it for work. My mom told me, though that I need to give my brother a Wi-Fi password. However, it doesn't seem fair to me that I should be the one paying for this by myself while he HAS a job? So, last night I told my brother that we should split the bill in half. He got really angry at me and asked if he had to pay half if he should get some sort of a credit towards his DMV fine payments that he owes because he got a DUI last year? WTF?! That's so unfair! I can't pay his fines too. Am I being ridiculous in thinking he should chip in for using it?

28034,Non-Romantic,3issj0,"As my throwaway username states, I dislike my brother.

Borderline hate, however that sounds quite... mean. He is my brother after all. 

All these things build up, so I'm going to give a little backstory.

A very large wall of text ahead! (Sorry. There's a lot that pisses me off about him.)


I am the youngest of 3 children. I have an elder sister [21], we'll call her 'Minx'. 

Both my brother and my sister moved out at one point in time.

My brother (Let's call him Dave) moved back in around 3-4 years ago, due to becoming unemployed. My memory is a bit hazy, but  He then set up a home business and made quite a bit of money. He ate pizza delivered 24/7(pretty much) and spare time gaming pretty loudly.
Minx only recently moved back in (A couple of months ago), due to flatmate problems, but is now staying due to expecting a child. Minx is a wonderful sister, albeit a bit messy, but I enjoy having her company from time to time.

My father, 'Harry', has never exactly liked Dave. Dave got mad, and kicked a large dent in the side of the family car. They, of course, made him pay it off. 

My mother, 'Krism', always looks out for her children and tries to integrate Dave into the family. She cooks healthy meals for him, even when he's asleep, invites him to eat with us, invites him out on family activities, the works. She drives him down to his minimum wage job on rainy days, drives him down to the supermarket to get cigarettes and Coke Zero. However, he seems to only use the family home to sleep and play games, Dave isn't really a part of our family.

Oh yeah, Dave smokes. Reason number 1 why I don't like him. But on it's own, it isn't much. To each his own.

Dave leaves dishes in his room. Due to his smoking he gets stuff in his throat. He spits that into *glasses that people drink out of*. That disgusts me. Hygiene is a pretty big thing for me, I don't like to lick my fingers, if there is something on my hands I'll wash it off as soon as I'm finished doing what got it on there in the first place. Dave also plays video games on his computer. One time, he decided he couldn't be bothered walking up the stairs to go to the bathroom so *he peed into the family casserole dish*. I mean, WTF. How did he even get it there in the first place!? 

He doesn't shower often, partially because of his gaming. Sitting in the car with him is a nightmare, all you can smell is ciggarette smoke, BO mixed with body spray, and old pizza. I wind down the window and try to breathe as much clean air as I can. His room smells even worse. My room is right next to his. Dave leaves his door open. I go downstairs to go to bed, and my room smells absolutely atrocious. I have tried asking him politely to shut his door. His response is 'not my problem'. (For those wondering, I leave my door open as my cat's litter tray, food, and water are in my room. She has toileting issues so she stays locked in my room at nighttime.). If I leave my window open, my room will be freezing cold by the time I get to bed. 

This stink follows him around. It will linger there for 5-10 minutes once he's left the room. 

He doesn't follow simple manners I was brought up on. In our house, we're not allowed to wear shoes inside. Nope, he's exempt to trod his dirty shoes covered in mud around the house. I go to take a shower, and the floor, where I put my clothes, and towel while I'm in the shower is dirty. 

He doesn't knock before going into rooms with closed doors. Lounge and dining room excluded. On the rare occasion he wants something from me, he'll barge into my room if the door is shut. One time I was in the middle of changing, luckily I was decent. With toilet/bathroom, he will knock once (and push the door open at the same time). Sometimes the lock on the door fails, so I have to cry out 'IM IN HERE'.

Opening what's not yours. People in our house rarely drink sugary drinks (like Coke) but there was a cola life in the fridge that was being saved for some reason. Dave opens it, drinks a glass of it, and doesn't touch it. As I'm one of the only people in the house that can currently drink soft drinks (Minx is pregnant and is trying to stay away from that stuff) I had to drink it all by myself across 4 days. By the weekend, it was flat.

In my family, we eat together at the dinner table. Some nights conversation is sparse (particularly if we like what we're eating) but most of the time we talk about things, then wait for other members of the family to finish eating and talk. Of course, staying at the table isn't mandatory. Dave will either A: Have gotten fish and chips and a burger on his way home from work (around 3pm-ish) and not be hungry, B: Take forever to come up to eat his food, come up 3 hours later and eat in his room C: Come up, take his food, and eat it in his room, or D: (This pisses me off the most) Ignore the food because it doesn't match his workout standards (Which consist of eating baked beans, steak, and eggs. No vegetables, nope) and ordering a pizza. Or two. This annoys me because our mother (Krism) puts so much thought into making sure every meal accomadates everyones needs. Minx is vegetarian, Harry (My father, if you've forgotten) doesn't like mashed potatoes, and I don't like rare meat or capsicum. Krism does everything she can, even when she's taking a soup detox and can't eat what we're eating. And Dave just tosses out what he doesn't like (Usually hand cut chips that Krism makes). 

Dave has a horrendously short temper, especially when he's trying (and failing) at giving up smoking. He's tried to give up so many times, and he hasn't lasted that long. If you say something to him, his immediate response is angry and impatient.
Example: We had a gift for him (From a homestay student we had). She was coming down the stairs slowly, whereas I had raced down them. I knocked on his door, and realized that the student was tying the ribbon which had come undone. 

Oh hey Dave. Wait a moment... I told him.

What am I waiting for!? He proceeded to snap at me.

Wait for it... 

Oi, Oniisanwadaikirai, WHAT AM I WAITING FOR?! I know that doesn't seem as bad but he was really pissy.

Another example.

Hey Dave, do you think that when you let my sister's cat out of your room, you could shut her back in her room? We have two cats, one that came with my sister and my one. My cat has anxiety issues and doesn't like other cats. My sister's cat likes to sit in Dave's room, but he kicks her out into the hallway, where she gets into fights with my cat. I have often had to run across the house to split them up because he couldn't do a simple thing of putting her into her room.

Why are you asking me to do this?! It's not my problem! Dave replied.

I know, but then she gets into fights with my cat. If you could just put her in her room (note that the room is less than 3 metres from his room), it would be really helpful. I tried again.

NO. I WON'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. I backed off there. He also wouldn't shut her in her room *even though she was repeatedly scratching on his door to be let in*. I guess it still wasn't his problem. 

He constantly complains about his minimum wage job, yet does nothing about it, and spends all his spare time playing online computer games. He stays up until 4am on his spare days. He often swears loudly which can be heard throughout the house. He is yelling and swearing and his teammates late at night *while I am in the room next door trying to sleep*. I hope that when the baby comes he will stop.

Final story, I promise.

Dave likes to work out. After years of living on pizza and coke zero, no exercise and hours on his computer, he decided to buy some gym equipment. He has no place to put this gym equipment in his room, so he rearranges one of the store rooms to fit this gym equipment. Please note that lots of my sisters stuff has to be stored in the garage, there isn't much space. He is storing his stuff in two different rooms (plus his own). He works out at random times in the evening. He then (without asking) goes into my room and works out on my floor. He throws my cat's toys out of the way, often uprooting them so that she can't get into them (two boxes, a scratch bad, various marbles and beads, and a wholeeeeee lotta paper). This room is *my personal space*, and he has been invading it. I have caught him once working out in my room, and all I have as evidence from other times are my cat's things being moved. He stopped for a period of time, but I recently found the stuff moved again. I reset it. If I find them moved again I will approach him and tell him to stop. I half hope he will overreact and get kicked out of the house.

28055,Non-Romantic,2omtzl,"So backstory: I've known my ex (let's call him Ben) since I was a kid. He's always been very close to my family, to the point that my parents are basically serving as the de-facto parents of the groom.

Ben and I started dating when we were 16, and broke up a year after college. It was a mutual decision, we both had a lot of emotional baggage and it seemed like the best choice at the time. I ended up spending 18 months traveling and kind of bouncing around the world, while he worked and stayed close to home.

Ben met Hannah before I got back to the states, and they got engaged a few weeks after I got back. 

My mom is playing a big role in the planning process, both of my brothers are groomsman, and I'm actually a bridesmaid. Hannah wanted me as one of her bridesmaids because I'm like the groom's sister (gag me). 

The closer the wedding gets, the more I see of both of them.

First of all, full disclosure, I still carry a little bit of a torch for Ben. It's not a huge crush, but there's definitely a little something there. We dated for like 7 years. It's not a massive swooning crush and I don't hold any resentment toward Hannah, but there's a little tiny bit of an attraction there. 

Second of all, I'm fairly sure that he still carries a little bit of a torch for me. He made a couple comments that suggested that he regretted breaking up, even though he hasn't emotionally cheated or anything like that. It seems like he gave up on me and is ignoring any latent feelings and focusing on the present. 

So moving to the present: Hannah has three bridesmaids: me, a college friend, and a childhood friend. We're going to call her college friend Lucy. Lucy and Hannah are very close friends, and there's nothing wrong with that. 

Last weekend, my mom organized a kind of all-weekend DIY sleepover at their house. Basically all of us (bridesmaids, bride, and a few others like my brother's gf) were going to spend the weekend glue-gunning favors and stuffing mason jars. 

So the first night, I got a weird vibe from Lucy, like she was upset about something. I asked my bro's gf and she had noticed the same thing. 

So Lucy, Hannah, my brother's gf, and I were supposed to be sharing a room, but my brother's gf had discreetly migrated to my brother's bedroom so it was just the three of us. It felt really tense and weird, and I heard them start snapping at each other the moment I left the room. At this point, I was curious, so when I came back I told them I was going upstairs but I really just waited outside. I know, I know, but it was my house and I'm nosy as fuck.

Conversation was kind of muffled, but basically Hannah said that she loved Ben and then Lucy said asked why she [Lucy] even bothered. And then Hannah backtracked and started talking about how she loved Lucy too and that she didn't want to end things. And Lucy said that she had to make a choice. And then Hannah apologized and it seriously sounded like there was some kind of physical affection. When I came back through the door, they weren't talking and Hannah would not look me in the eye. The next morning, the two of them had some kind of argument and Lucy left right after. Hannah told my mom it was just something with Lucy's brother.

So I told my brother's gf about all of this, and she said that it made perfect sense based on their behavior over the weekend and that she believed me, but that she didn't think anyone else would because it wasn't like I had proof and I was the groom's ex-girlfriend. 

And there's really no polite way to ask my ex's fiance if she's cheating on him. I could try talking to Ben about it, but I highly highly doubt that he would believe me. I feel like I need to make sure that my ex doesn't make a massive mistake, but I feel like I don't know how to stop it. 

My brother's gf is right, it's one of those things that doesn't sound as credible if you weren't there. 

**TL;DR: Pretty sure my ex's fiancee is cheating with her college best friend. I feel obligated to tell him, but know that it will not go over well or be particularly believable.**

I recently started a new job thanks to one of my old friends I've known forever. It's a tiny family business and I started here about 4 weeks ago now. Tiny as in, I work directly with my friend and his dad works in a side office next to us. That's it.

The job itself has been wonderful, but the problem that has arisen is that while trying to remember the name of a website I was sent to for work, I discovered history of porn sites all throughout the weeks I've worked here, about 30 minutes after I've gone home for the day. After thinking back to who could even be doing this since I'm usually the last one in the office and they both have their own computers to do this nasty business, I realized that every day porn was looked at, my friend's brother was in the office visiting.

It's very obvious its him that's using my computer after I leave for the day and I confirmed it yesterday. I am really disgusted knowing that right now I am sitting in a chair using a computer that some guy is fapping on after I leave for the day. If I was in a larger business, I would report this immediately, but this is my friend's brother and I have no idea how to approach this tactfully without making things super awkward in the workplace. It sucks that someone who doesn't even work in this office is causing this issue that they don't even know exists. I have thought about putting a new password on this computer, but I would have to give the password to my friend and without confronting about the situation, I know if his brother asked for the pass he would give it since...its his brother.

28078,Non-Romantic,3h0hyp,"Hi Reddit,

I'm just looking for some advice or perspective on this situation, especially from anyone who was in a similar position. I'm sorry if the back story is long, but I'm just trying to give a full picture of the situation.


My parents were married, but separated when I was about 3. I don't have many memories of them actually living together, but distinctly remember being shuttled between houses when they shared custody. They finally divorced when I was 8. My father was, and is, an alcoholic, and was mostly verbally, though occasionally physically, abusive towards me and my mother. I personally believe he has some sort of mental disorder, perhaps an anxiety disorder, and most certainly suffers from an inferiority complex. He is not a nice person and has never been a real father in any sense of the word. My memories of him are scared, confused, and mostly involve being alone in his apartment while he was passed out drunk.


We moved to another state when I was still young (me and my mother) and the last time I saw my father was when I was 12, on a court-ordered visit that went so badly my mother refused to send me again, though it technically violated their divorce agreement. He sort of cared, or said he did and made a fuss, but never acted on it and 12 years flew by.


Over this time, our communication has been sporadic. I used to talk to him on the phone with some regularity, but he would often be drunk. At some point, we lost contact completely and I have been told that he was temporarily homeless during this time. About two years ago, he found me on facebook and started contacting me. Though at first I wasn't interested, I made an effort and would reply in detail and try to tell him about my life. 


It was all very strange...He still calls me silly nicknames I guess he used to call me when I was little, he used to ask questions about my mom's relatives he hasn't seen or known in many, many years. I think he really lives in the past. After a couple episodes of him drunkenly making me believe a close relative of my mine was dying (I still have no idea why, never got an explanation, and he denies it ever happened), I was mostly fed up, though I still return his emails. He emails about twice a month to say something bizarre. Sometimes he asks me how graduate school is, but the conversation never goes farther. I think his mental health has severely deteriorated.

The one thing he did email me about, though, was to ask me in a not very nice manner if my fiance is a muslim. My fiance and I met in graduate school. He comes from another country, and a muslim family. I'm worried about what my father would do and how he would act (would he cause a drunken scene?) in any case, topped off by his already bad and racist attitude towards my fiance.


I'm really feeling no desire to have him there, but for some reason I'm conflicted. I feel sorry for him more than anything, as he is 56 years old and completely alone, with no savings, no family... I just don't even know him anymore. Am I crazy for even considering inviting him? 



TLDR; I'm feeling conflicted about inviting my estranged alcoholic father to my wedding, both because of his potential behavior, and his bad attitude towards my fiance's culture.

Over the past year, I have also been having a very difficult time with my relationship and depression. I definitely have had less free time (new job plus medication for depression makes me want to sleep a lot).

I always had very good reasons why I was not available (which I clearly communicated with her). And these things were not planned out -- they were usually things she asked me to do with her the day of the event.  It seemed unreasonable that she would be upset with me for having a separate life, but I know she's kind of needy so I never really took offense. I would just calmly tell her I hope she has fun and I'm sorry I have to miss it.

The last week she spoke to me, she asked me to go to a hockey game with her. I was working that night, so she kept pushing me to come to the game after I was done (the game would have been 1/2 over). I was honest and said I hate hockey, I am exhausted, I don't want to drive down there. I suggested she ask one of her other friends and told her we could go for lunch the week after instead. She seemed annoyed with me and acted a little passive aggressive but I let that go.

I did a few favors for her that week. She thanked me and joked around with me and everything was great. She sent me a picture of a project she completed and I told her how much I loved it, she seemed pleased. That was the last time she ever talked to me.

We normally would say hi at least every couple of days, so for a few days I didn't realize she was ignoring me. I just thought she was busy (reading my texts but not responding). Then I started getting worried. She wouldn't answer my calls. She was reading my texts but ignoring me completely. I called her at work and she wouldn't answer (but I knew she was there based on her phone greeting which she changes daily with the date).  

I've always been concerned in my texts to her. I told her I'm confused and that I apologize if I've done something but to please talk to me. I know for a fact there is nothing I've done. But I was more than willing to hear her out. NOTHING. So for a while I'd send her one brief, friendly text per week just checking in, telling her about my life and asking her to please talk to me.  Still nothing.

That was 6 months ago. I don't want to be over-dramatic, but she was a very close (although somewhat annoying at times) friend and this was a horrible experience.  Just today she texted me hi. I did not respond because at this point, what could she possibly say? She's completely shunned me for 1/2 a year with zero explanation. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who could do that. Am I being immature to not even give her a chance?

28094,Non-Romantic,2n43v7,"Hello,

So recently, an old friend of mine messages me (let's call him friend A) and lets me know this particular group of friends misses me since I moved on from being friends with them and essentially choosing my relationship years ago. These were not my only friends; I still retained a different group of good friends who I still talk to. A little back story...

In this particular group of friends, with A, B, and C, I was essentially that friend who was the butt of all jokes. I worked with these guys and was friends with them for about two years. I was the one that was given a hard time the most and whatnot, but that's what friends do, to an extent.

Friend B was the main jokester of the group. He also was the most alpha one would say. After a recent breakup with his girlfriend at the time, out of depression of some sort he posted something on social media that humiliated my girlfriend just to make himself feel better for some reason (but took it off eventually when friends A and C even thought was harsh). I didn't tell my girlfriend about it and just ignored it. She found out and from that day forward hated B with a passion. I pretty much had to pick between them or my relationship, I picked her because I had other friends of my own that would never do this.

I was roommates with C. Needless to say it did not work out. I have come to the conclusion that a lot of friends who become roommates have a decent chance of ruining friendships. There was an imbalance of living conditions so I moved in with my girlfriend instead. After the lease I did not speak to C ever since.

My relationship has been going on three years. It has its ups and downs like any relationship. Arguments are had but so are many good moments. Her friends (both [M] and [F]) are really supportive and the drama is pretty much null. I met plenty of good friends since I met her.

My girlfriend expresses total distaste for these old friends and does not want anything to do with them. And for what B did, I can't say I blame her. From what A was telling me, there were no hard feelings anymore. I tell her well that was three years ago, but if the situation was reversed and her friends made all this unnecessary drama, would I have left or made her choose between me or her drama-starting friends? If friends would cross such personal boundaries were they your real friends to begin with?

So, when A reached out to me, he tells me how everyone misses me and how everything is not the same without me. He was planning on having a get-together with the old friends, and invited my girlfriend and I. Hearing about all of this gave me a glimmer of hope that everything would be all good. At this point though, gf is not on the approving side because of the drama in the past. If I did choose to reconnect with these people I obviously wouldn't spend as much time as before because of how busy were are nowadays (we are students and we work).

I feel that my work and school life has improved. I moved to another city to get away from things for a while that were being said at my workplace from my old friends, and the anxiety that came with it.

So, after A reached out to me, I was hesitant at first whether I should take the offer to try to patch things up with them or not. It seemed like a great idea, but I kept trying to come up with a way to bring it up to my girlfriend. I eventually did, and she still has hard feelings because of how they used to joke if we would last, and how my roommate at the time spread personal details about my relationship where we worked making it awkward making me distant from everybody there.

**Edit:** Friend B lives elsewhere and everyone else sees him a couple times a year, not nearly as much as before. He is probably the one that gf dislikes the most. It doesn't sound like she is going to budge because if I did go through with this she's afraid of the same drama repeating itself. Would it be disrespectful to my gf if I let people back in my life that seemingly tainted my relationship with them since I got in a relationship?

**tl;dr:** old friend reaches out and comes around, wants to patch things up with our old friends but my gf feels sour about it because she does not trust them. These were not my only friends; I still have friends of my own that she likes, but  she does not trust these friends because of past drama, yet I think about the good memories I had with these old friends all the time. I can either take the dive and befriend these people again at the cost of my relationship, maintain my romantic relationship and move on with the mutual friends we have and the few friends I have, or attempt to make things work out with both sides.

28102,Non-Romantic,1tujtw,"Throwaway just in case. This is my first post so I apologize in advance for crappy formatting.  


TL;DR - My friend has been bad mouthing me online behind my back. Additionally, she has been excluding me from our mutual friends and never initiates conversations or goes out of her way to talk to me. Things finally came to a head when she accused me of being uncaring because I did not visit her at college this past semester. Without mentioning I saw her post, I apologized. I thought we reconciled, but instead she is angry that I found out she has been posting about me.  
  

Okay, around the beginning of summer I found out my best friend, K, of about 4 years has been talking about me on her twitter behind my back. Ever since I found out, I've felt pretty hurt and didn't know how to act around her. I tried to pretend that I never found out, but it's always in the back of my mind. We didn't really hang out a lot over the summer, but I did say I'd like to come visit her at school and she agreed.  


So, school starts and I'm texting her like normal but she sorta sounds like she doesn't want to talk to me - you know? Like when people give back shorter responses and never further the conversation. It was like that. Ultimately, I just stopped texting her and she never initiated a conversation with me.  


Around Thanksgiving, our mutual friends got together while everyone was home from college. K is usually the one to invite me but she didn't. So it was basically our whole group minus me. I found out through Facebook since they posted a bunch of photos from it. I felt pretty left out and hurt about that but I never brought it up.  


Last week, I text her after a long hiatus, saying we should get together while she was home. I mostly did it to see if she was even interested in seeing me since we had not spoken in some time. She agreed though.  


But last week, she posted about how angry she is at her friends back home because they (me and another friend) weren't caring enough to come visit her at college an hour away and only wanted to hang out with her now since it was convenient for us. And how I even took a plane to see my boyfriend but I didn't put any effort to see her at her college. I was shocked and mad that'd she would say that considering she never went out of her way to invite me to come up or even text me.  


I finally decided to say something about it and I texted her and told her that I was sorry if I hurt her feelings about not visiting and I'm sorry we have been distant and I'm sorry if I've done anything to hurt her and I wish we could (still) be friends. She replied saying omg no we are totally fine and that she is just really shitty at communicating and saying we should hang out over break. So I thought we were okay.  


(NOTE: Just to clarify, I never explicitly said I saw her post about me or anything like that. I didn't even bring up that I was hurt that she did not invite me to go out with our friends. I texted her apologizing for the distance in our friendship this past semester. I was not accusing or angry sounding or confrontational. Just apologetic.)  


But a couple days later she posts about how rude it is that people look at her public posts and that it's her place to vent and people should not to bring up her posts in person. This was very obviously aimed at me. Whether or not I was intended to see it, I do not know.  


So I'm totally at a loss. I feel like she's blaming me for finding out that she is complaining about me behind my back. And when I try to fix it and apologize (for whatever I did) in person (well via text) she gets mad that I brought it up. I could be at fault for seeing her posts, but they're on a public website. I didn't read her diary or anything. I'm just so hurt and confused. I feel like she's angry at me for trying to clear the air and for trying to be straight and honest with each other.

28117,Non-Romantic,2wykki,"Throwaway because my family is on reddit, and sorry for the length.

My sister and I usually get along. We absolutely hated each other when we were kids but once we became adults things settled down. She is married and lives 20 minutes away with her husband. I live at home with my parents and my brother [29M]. My sister and I would go shopping together maybe once a month and we would text each other a funny picture or story a few times a month. Prior to this incident, she used to come over to our house about every other weekend. She is much closer with our brother and oldest sister than she is with me, which might be because of our age gap. I am the youngest while the other three and within 1-2 years of each other.

A few weeks before Christmas, I had announced to my family that I would be taking a vacation for the holidays and that I would not be celebrating Christmas, buying presents, expecting gifts, etc. I gave my parents a few emergency contact phone numbers, told them I would contact them every day, and gave them the exact dates I would be gone. My parents were fine with this arrangement. (If relevant: I paid for the trip myself and have been financially independent for 1-2 years. I live at home but pay rent and all my own expenses.) Also we're not a very tight-knit family. Christmas is not a big deal and there have been many holidays where at least a few of us are gone.

The only people who knew where I was going were my best friend (who drove me to the airport) and the person I was visiting on my trip. Even my boss only knew that I was Taking some much-needed time off. My sister asked but I did not tell her. I made it clear that no one knew and I would not be telling anyone. My vacation went extremely well and I came home two weeks later happy and relaxed and ready to start the new year. The day I got home while I was unpacking my bags on my bed, my sister came over. She said she had my Christmas present. I told her that I didn't get her anything/didn't expect anything but she said I saw it at the store and just had to get it for you. Okay, no big deal. As I unwrapped the gift, she asked me, So where did you go on your vacation? I thought I had made it clear that I would not be sharing that information prior to leaving, so I replied with, It doesn't matter.

Well, that set her off. I was looking down at the gift, still unwrapping it, and I heard the door slam shut. She stormed right out of my room and into my brother's room across the hall. I'm standing there like ???

She then went downstairs to the room my mom was in and began SCREAMING that I was being a selfish brat. Why shouldn't my family get to know where I went? Why does no one get to know about my mystery vacation? Why am I so special? Why doesn't SHE get to know? (Keep in mind, even my parents didn't know. Nor did they care once I got home safe and sound.)

When I say she was screaming, I mean she was screaming at the top of her lungs for 10 minutes. I told her that I was safe where I went, and that even our parents didn't freak out over it like she did. I also told her that she was not my mother and did not have any right to tell me what to do with my life, and that she was acting completely psychotic and I was done talking to someone that crazy. I went back into my room and tried to block out the noise.

My brother (usually the mediator in family arguments) left his room and told my sister to calm down. That was very surprising since the two of them are VERY close. I opened my door a little and heard him say, She is an adult. She can go where she wants whenever she wants. She made it clear she isn't telling you so I don't know why you're getting so mad. I go places all the time without telling everyone in the family. Why is it any different for her? 

+100 points for him.

It is now almost two months later and my sister still hasn't spoken to me. And I don't know who is at fault (for lack of better phrase). Should I be reaching out to her? Was I wrong for not telling her where I went? Does she owe me an apology? I really need an outsider's opinion on all this. 

(Where I went, in case it matters: I had been in a long distance relationship for three years. My family, friends, coworkers, everyone knew about my boyfriend. My SO [22M] broke up with me in October right before he was supposed to come visit. We had plans to get married. My family knew we broke up and assumed I stopped all contact with him. My SO  asked me to come visit him for Christmas to try to work things out and so that neither of us would be alone for the holidays and I agreed. I have visited him at least 5 or 6 times in the past and there was no question of whether or not I would be safe or have somewhere to stay, etc. I didn't want to tell anyone where I was going because I didn't want to hear any of the backlash against my boyfriend. I feel like it is my life and I should be the one who gets to make the decisions. And I am 100% sure that if I had told my sister that I was going to visit my SO, she would have given me a lecture about how I am making a mistake, how he is not worth it since he broke up with me once and that's enough, and that I am wasting my time. I would just like to point out that I had the best Christmas ever with him and his family. They treated me like I was part of their family and I felt more at home in their country than I would have literally in my own house.)

They are living a good life, he has nothing to complain about. I dont know where this comes from suddenly. He always had a beer now and then, but never on a daily basis and this much (we are talking about 4 liters per evening).

28149,Non-Romantic,2v7fzp,"For some background, I have grown up in a Christian environment and household since I was born. We used to live in California for 12 years, and during that time period most, if not all, of my friends were church friends and Christian. I was also Christian, believing that Jesus was my savior and that he died for our sins...etc. It was kind of a blind following among me and friends in my honest opinion, though I do have a few friends who have remained Christians over the years. Eventually, we moved to Oregon because of my dad's job. This was my first real experience of people who were not Christian and knew what they believed in and why. My first two friends that I made were Atheist and Mormon. 

Last year, after some significant time thinking and soul searching, I discovered that Christianity was something that wasn't for me. I found it to be limiting and restraining my ability to figure out myself as a person. I also felt that because I am going to college this year, I wanted to start fresh and figure out what I believe in for myself. Granted, I do share some similar morals with Christians like abstinence in drinking, smoking, etc. and don't really want to have sex unless my partner is someone who I feel like I have a deep connection and relationship with. 

Anyways, now for the actual reason for this post.

I recently came out to my dad and mom about not being Christian anymore. I told them that I respected their beliefs, but I found that for now, this religion is working for me. I told them about how I felt restrained and how I want to believe in what I believe because I genuinely believe it, not because I grew up with it. I do believe in the existence of a god however, and I do have strong evidence to support it. After some research (and partially wanting to give my parents some relief), I told them that I am currently a Deist. Deists are people who believe that God created the world and then let it be. They do not believe in an emotional or spiritual connection with God, which is something that I agree with currently. 

After telling them all of this, my mom was super questionable and my dad has never been able to put it down. Since I am going off to college soon, him and I have agreed (before all of this) to go out for coffee once a weekend to just chat and catch up with each other since we never see each other during the week (due to his work and all). The issue with my dad though is that now whenever we sit down and talk, he constantly hammers my belief with his own, claiming his as absolute truth and denying that I can not believe in anything that is really true unless I believe that Jesus saved me...etc. He has been trying to shove evidence for his beliefs down my throat every time, using apologetics (a kind of study to prove the existence of God and Jesus) and archaeological findings. I tell him that I acknowledge his beliefs and can appreciate the fact that he has proof for his argument, but at the same time I remind him that I am not Christian currently and I want to figure out what I believe for myself. After I say something along the lines of that, he then proceeds to tell me that my life will go down the drain and I will make horrific decisions and turn out terribly as an adult. 

Now this hurts. I am a responsible student, and with the money from my university I am able to pay for about half of the tuition cost (About 10,000 US dollars) just because of my grades. I also have never smoked, drunk, or had sex (because I don't plan on it!). I have treated both him and my mom with respect my whole life and did chores and whatever they asked for. I also tell them when I'll be home if I'm out and come back in time for their curfew. 

I honestly don't know what to do get to my dad's head... Any help is appreciated.

Within the last three years, this friend has been overly nostalgic about the past more than ever as I am more a “live-in-the-present” sort of individual who understands our fun, “no-cares” past but is more interested and open to whatever lies ahead.  He has married a girl I dated briefly back in high school, which adds a layer of connection to us all, and recently he has had his first child with her.

I moved last year far away from our home state and city, where he still resides, and ever since then, most of his texts and emails refer to past remembrances and are seering with the feeling of longing in his writing, and I’m simply out of words for this kind of relationship with this guy.  I want to tell him to focus on what his needs are (his family) rather than his wants (me to live closer to them), but he just can’t get in that mode because we both know that our social lives were on the line if I ever moved (we were never social butterflies exactly).  He basically lost a drinking buddy when times got too hard, and it was his only drinking buddy to turn to.

So what say you, Reddit?  Without being an asshole but without being a “yes man,” how do I find the middle ground and what can I say about this situation in an email to him to direct him properly towards the attention of his new child and wife?

28177,Non-Romantic,3iopjb,"Hi everyone. Hopefully you can help me decipher my mom's behavior because I just don't understand. Here's a little about me so you can understand what my mom is criticizing: I'm 19, female, I have a twin sister, commuter student &amp; double business major at a private university, intelligent (3.8 GPA), hard-working (I had two jobs this summer), and **a lot** of money saved. ambitious, introverted, and shy. I've never had a boyfriend or been on a date. I have a very small group of friends. I'm very conscientious, responsible, and morally-abiding and I never went through a typical rebellious teenage phase. I've been very easy for my parents to handle, in fact, I can't tell you how many people have come up to her and have told her to be blessed for having such good kids. However, I can't take her criticism anymore. 


Here are some of the lines that my mom has said to me:
1. (Yelling)You're a loser; what teenager hangs out with their parents on a Saturday night. (Context: we went out for dinner).  
2.  No one will ever want to date you.   
3. You're never going to get married.  
4. No guy on campus will ever date you now. I'm sure he told everyone that you'll reject them, so there's no point. [because I politely rejected one guy's offer for dinner who was very creepy/persistent].   
5. You're going to die alone/live alone with 6 cats.   
6. You're so antisocial.  
7. You're wasting your life.   
8. What kind of kids did I give birth to? What kind of person has to read a book to go to fucking party? (It was a  book on confidence).   
9. You're not normal. [because I don't smoke/drink/go to college parties often].  
10. You're just going to abandon me one day.   
11. How does [insert old friend's name] have a boyfriend and not you? People made fun of her.  
12. You're wasting my money at [insert my college]. I'm not just paying for you to get good grades. Otherwise I would have sent to [insert local community college].  
13. You got all of your bad (physical) traits from your father, not me.   
14. OH MY GOD! No wonder why you have no friends. Good luck with that. (because I said I felt uncomfortable going to raging parties and being the shy, sober one).   
15. You're not even going to be there for me on my deathbed. (That was very hurtful, considering I spend a lot of time with my mom).   
16. (She bought me a jacket that was too big and I said, I appreciate the gesture, it's a nice jacket, but it's too big, did they have a smaller size?). Oh my God, why do I even bother? I'm never buying you anything anymore, so don't ask.   

I could go on, but I'm assuming you get the point. I've told my mom that she's critical, but she'll just fire back saying that she's just making an observation. She's in complete denial that she's critical and she's never apologized for what she's said. In fact, she'll deny saying it or she'll say that I misinterpreted what she said. I went to therapy and talked about this. I tried to make it family therapy, but my mom is convinced that she doesn't have issues. I love her so much, but it's heartbreaking. I can't stand to hear her talk about my sister &amp; I this way.  I just want her to be a nurturing, supportive mother, but I guess that's too much to ask. My dad always tells her to stop being so critical and to leave my sister and I alone. My dad thinks we're great kids. Any advice?

Backstory: My friend, Jenny and I have been best friends since meeting in college. She's literally the only person I've been friends with this long and really, she's my only friend I trust.


Her mother divorced her father and was remarried. Her mother is a free spirit. They never had a good relationship. She was raised by her ultra conservative father, a preacher, and all through college she was very strict about it. Believed in abstinence, went to church every Sunday, etc. She got her degree in a religious/Christian field. As for me, I'm fairly liberal. My fiancé and I are swingers. I've been with men and women, I'm engaged to a man now and very happy. I'm not religious, I don't do church, etc. this has never been an issue with us. While she never approved of what I did she still loved me and accepted me. I never gave her gorey details of any of my escapades.


Fast forward to current day. She and her father are now estranged. Shit went down and my fiancé and I opened our home to her.  She has since flourished in a sense. She has a steady job and she's out from under her father's thumb. She has a great relationship with her mom now. I'm happy for her. 



**Part of my issue may stem from the fact that my dad cheated on my mom and I have had 2 exes cheat on me. So I kind of see Jenny as the home wrecker. I have major issues with home wreckers. Can't stand them.


The issue:

 She has recently come out as polyamorous. This alone isn't an issue to me, I'm open minded. She is polyamorous with a married couple. They have an open marriage. She is the husband's side piece. The wife and husband had a lot of dialogue with her about it. This is also not a bother to me. My problem is that the wife is clearly not handling this well. I feel Jenny is pushing it too far. Now, the wife's side piece is 2 states away and married with kids. His wife and children have no idea he's with her. This causes strain. She is jealous. This is the first time the open marriage couple have had a side piece this close. It's only been long distance for them before.

Did I mention this has all taken place over the span of 3 weeks? She talked to the open marriage couple in week 1, by week 2 she was interested. Week 3 she and the husband confessed their love for each other. 3 weeks!  Also, the husband and wife are Jenny's coworkers. The wife works at another store and the husband works with Jenny. 


Now, Jenny is a virgin in that she's never had intercourse. She's finding it hard to hold herself back and I keep telling her she should get on BC first, she agrees but has yet to make an appointment. The BC was her idea first. I just want her to be safe. If she got pregnant the wife would raise hell. Maybe even get the baby.


Jenny could tell I wasn't keen on all of this and felt judged by me. How could I, as a swinger, judge her? (Personally, sharing sex is ok to me, but sharing your heart with someone else is cheating to me) I explained that it wasn't that. I just worried because I felt like she was rushing things and not being cautious. We talked it out and I've tried to be supportive but the bottom line is I am not ok with what she is doing. It all seems toxic. She spends almost half of the week at their house at this point. The husband has to be back in the wife's bed by morning so she's been up late with him a lot to spend time with him. She's always exhausted. 

Jenny has been pushing boundaries, making the wife uncomfortable. She has explicitly told the wife that she will not be number 2 forever, that she wants them to split the husband evenly in the far future. They even talked about having kids eventually, and how that would work out. The husband hasn't set strict boundaries on this or defended his wife at all. 

I could almost overlook it if it wasn't for the fact that she talks about it/him constantly. I'm so tired of hearing it. I tried to have a dialogue about it but it's bothering me really badly. She wants my fiancé and I to meet the husband, and I can't fathom it. I've toyed with the idea of asking her to leave me out of it. That I love her and will always be there for her but I don't want any part of it. My fiancé says this will push her away and I shouldn't. That I should just go with the flow. I'm not good at hiding how I feel. I'm a die hard honesty is the best policy lady. 

Is there a way I can express this all to her and not lose her as a friend? Am I wrong here? How do I deal with this when it is bothering me so much?

28184,Non-Romantic,3gocsp,"So my cousin has been like a brother to me since I was kid, and considering I only have sisters this he has meant a lot to me. However he has a huge problem with alcohol (which he will admit to) and also has some extreme emotional problems, which when combined results in him just spewing vitriol and blowing up at people. 


The latest problem has to do with something that happened over 13 fucking years ago when I was in high school. I was a senior and I had a party at my house, I invited all of my friends including my cousin. He ended up passing out before most, and I told him he could take my moms bed. Eventually one of my friends sneaks in and the next day I hear that they had sex... Okay whatever. I was little grossed out that they would do that in my moms bed and that he was sleeping with someone from high school but I tried not to make anything about it. 


A few years pass and it comes up in conversation. He denies it up and down. He even said she was saying all of these things like how big of a dick he had. I said, jokingly, she said it was small and unimpressive. He looks dejected and it gets dropped. Any other time it comes up, he gets super fucking pissed and calls her names (fatty, piggy, etc) and stresses that it didn't happen. A few times he's told me he was raped. And when I've asked him point blank You were raped? he responds with shrugged shoulders and a Maybe.


Anyways, it came up again a few weeks ago, and I DMed him asking how he was. Three hours later he messages me and all he is doing is insulting me, tells me I'm an asshole, PoS, etc, etc... Insulting my life decisions, my family... He thinks I'm terrorizing him because of my own personal issues. We have a back and forth and he starts asking if I'm going to come over and bring booze...


I'm fucking fed up. I mean, he's family, and we have been/were close for a long time. So cutting him off seems like a terrible thing to do, but he has been stressing me out more and more lately and claims that I never think about his feelings and that I'm selfish. And honestly it makes me mad that he believes that. I want so desperately to make him realize I try to be there for him and actually care how he thinks and feels, but it's like arguing with a wall. I'm at my wits end.

28193,Non-Romantic,2lqghf,"Me and my friend, let's call her Nancy, have been friends since we were 11. We would chat online when we couldn't hang out, and as internet chatting drifted off, we began texting and always constantly texting. We started hanging out more at around age 15 and tried to make it a point to hang out every week. 

But I feel like these past few years of friendship have been really shitty. To be quite frank, I feel like Nancy makes me her side bitch. What I mean is, I go out and hang with my different friends all of the time, and I enjoy going out and doing things. But when she and I hang out, it's always at one or the other's house... I'm not going to lie, I get really jealous, because she does go out and do things with her other friends. I feel like that even though we've been friends for so long, I'll never be one of her best friends even though I've always considered her one of mine.

She's met my other friends before, and I've met a few of her friends, but she doesn't invite me out with any of them. I would invite her to hang out with me and my other friends, you know? That's why I feel like a side bitch. She'll hang out with me when it's just us, but with anyone else there, no. 

When we hang out, she wants to do the same boring indoor stuff all of the time. She judges me because of my sense of humour (I enjoy South Park, The Simpsons, crude comedy shows such as The Whitest Kids U'Know, etc.) meanwhile she only finds it funny to criticize other people (she thinks it's funny to call flamboyant people fruits, even though that can be taken offensively. She thinks it's funny to point out people's flaws and laugh about it.) Which I think is ridiculous that she'll judge me for liking satirical shows, but she goes around judging people all of the time. 

We don't like any of the same music save for a few songs, yet the stuff I like, she feels it's okay to look down upon. She'll play the music she likes that I don't and won't let me listen to I like. When I think about it, we actually have very little in common at all. 

She'll literally copy parts of my personality, or go out and get the same items as me, and I find it pretty unsettling. I'm not saying here that I'm the only person in the world allowed to like art. I'm just saying that I've been in art classes for years, and I make art a lot, and when we started hanging out more a few years ago, she suddenly loved painting, too. (She never cared about anything art-related before when we only hung out once in a while.) Just saying. 

She won't text back for ages, and all of her excuses are acceptable. But god forbid I'm busy and don't text back... that attitude infuriates me. Her whole personality infuriates me. The way she acts when she does something better or if she wins at a game, like her shit doesn't stink. She acts like she's the best at everything, when she's really not. 

I texted her two days ago, and she never replied. I sent her one more text tonight, like What's up? (Only one text, I'm not about to creepily blow up her phone, because I'm way too pissed off to do that.) And then I go on a social app and notice she updated, and what do you know, she's out with her actual socially-acceptable friends. 

I do get jealous, like I mentioned earlier. I don't care that she has other friends. But it's like, Really? You can't text back? I'm always there for anyone that texts me, even when I shouldn't be. Because I feel like something serious might happen and they might really need me. But if it's not life-threatening important, or my friends aren't really upset, I'll politely text them that I'm busy and I can't text right now.

I would never leave someone hanging for days. 

So I feel like our friendship just isn't right for each other. I couldn't actually go and talk to her about my issues with this, though, because she's kind of weird in this way. She NEVER ever ever talks about personal things. She literally makes it seem like her life is sunshine and daisies. And if you mention your problems to her, she kind of brushes off like it's nothing.

I actually tried to bring up these issues when I was talking to her, and she suddenly acted so smug. Like I don't care if it bothers you, you must be weirdly obsessed with me or something if you think I care as much about you as you do for me. She doesn't say things like that, but it's the tone. I do care. We've been friends for so many years, and I WANT it resolved. 

One of the times I got really pissed off at her, I actually did stop talking to her for a few days. And in this time, I noticed that she's way too stubborn to say sorry first. So I apologized first, and suddenly she was all I was so upset blah blah blah I've been having problems lately and this made it worse blah blah blah.

And I was just there like... the fuck? It showed me how close we actually AREN'T. If I'm close friends with someone, I would talk to them about my problems! If you can't come to me with your problems, then it just makes me feel like you don't consider me a close friend, you know? And you can guess what she did when I asked her what was wrong.... she blew it off and went back to acting like everything is perfect. 

Don't get me wrong, there are many things I do enjoy about when we hang out. However, the negatives probably outweigh the positives.

It's the combination of her smugness, her  I'm-better-than-everyone-at-everything attitude, how she probably doesn't consider me as important as her other friends, how we hardly have anything in common, how I get so pissed off at the mere thought of her (because of above) that lead me to believe that we're better off not friends. 

But I don't know how to just stop being friends with someone. The only people I've stopped being friends with are the ones I've accidentally drifted apart from. We really shouldn't be friends though, if she just puts me in such a negative mood. 

Do you think I should talk to her to work it out, or do you think I should just slowly stop talking to her?

Do you agree that I am not meant to be friends with her? I'll be grateful for all responses. Also, as venomous as some of my words may have been, I'd still really miss her as a friend because we've been friends for so long. I don't completely hate her, it's just these things she does (and has been doing more frequently) that really bother me/make me upset/make me angry that I really hate the most. But I don't want to live my life feeling like shit all of the time.

When talking to her maybe I should try to hide anything that might show that I'm not working as many hours as she is, so that it doesn't make her feel more miserable?

He went ballistic, threatened suicide, but eventually everything simmered down and he told me he was fine.  I was never really torn up about the breakup, which was odd because I'm a VERY emotional person, but that ship has sailed.  I feel like I'm fine, and I assume that he's fine.  

Through this past Fall semester, we didn't talk too much.  I was taking a full load of difficult classes, on top of working on my research project 30 minutes from campus, so my social life was somewhat limited to work and spending time at the library.  He has a lighter load and a softer major (not to knock on his workload, he just had less to do) and generally he would not leave the house, and not spend time with people.  I would stop by his house once in a while to chat for 15 minutes, ask for a favor, ask if he needed anything while I ran errands, small stuff like that, just trying to give him space while maintaining a friendship.  When I had time, I'd always invite him to hang out with me and my friends, including mutual friends, but he would reject me every time.  We'd text often.  

Now it's the holidays and I try to keep in contact with him and keep it friendly because I do consider him to be one of my closest friends, but he is still just so... not there.

My girl friend of 6 months (lets call her Marry) and her best friend (lets call him Seth), have been in a rough patch for about a month or two and I've been watching their relationship fall apart. Naturally I'm the one caught in the middle of it. I live in South Dakota (insert massive grumble fest about lack of nerds and fast internet) and they both live in Indiana so I can't sit them down and talk to them both face to face. 

Now Seth is one of my closest and dearest friends and I actually met Mary through him, but last year he went into a relationship that both I and Mary advised against separately (we didn't even know about each other at that point), but it basically turned him into a self pitying monster who can't get over his ex even a year later. He only seems to talk about himself and he's basically a shell of the guy we both grew to love. Over the past two months he's been getting really sensitive to anything we say (Mary and I are both smartass gingers with extremely strong opinions. Also worth noting, both of us lack the brain-mouth filter so things tend to just come out). He is refusing to admit that he's being overly sensitive and keeps saying that what we say and do are hurtful, even though it's a known fact that we're smartasses who tend to speak then think. 

He's actively refusing to accept that his ex left him and move on, and when both of us approach him about it he gets very defensive when we talk about how both of us were engaged to people who left us. He keeps saying that it's different and that our arguments are invalid.

She needed something large picked up from elsewhere and since I drive a big car she asked if we could use my car then carpool back to work. I said sure, left work to pick her up, she graciously bought me lunch as a thank you, and we brought it back. She took the parking pass from her car and put it into mine (we park in different areas and it's not free here) and we went back to work.    
    
    
Flash forward to yesterday, and I get a message from her asking to put the parking pass on the dining room table. We had both forgotten about the pass and she had continued parking in her structure only to get some parking tickets.

For starters, we're all in college in an apartment complex that is typically seen as a party area, but none of us really 'go out.' She is always mad if something is not clean, or if we're being too loud. Her room is next to our kitchen and always comes out yelling at us to 'stop yelling,' when we are just having a conversation in the kitchen while eating dinner. 

I will admit I was not the cleanest roommate but have since tried to be much tidier so as to not annoy her. I also was not the quietest but have always asked if I was being too loud or if she could hear me. For all of the fall semester, she said I was perfectly fine, even though I was the one that was worried. Spring semester, it's like a flip was switched.

I only have one month left living with her but the following arguments have made it ridiculous to even encounter her:

She refuses to speak to me. She will not make eye contact. She will not open her door to say, Hey stringbean, could you quiet down? She will not even text me that. She will text my friend roommate, because she knows that said friend roommate will then tell me. 

She talks down to both of us for not being as 'smart' as her as an MCB major. Any time I make a logical argument simply asking her to text me, hey please be quiet, she starts citing her mental issues as if it trumps everything, as if I am to 'bow down' to her rules as an MCB major that needs 100% quiet time starting at 8PM every school night. She also starts self-bashing on herself during any argument we have, which causes me to start complimenting her and trying to make her feel better. Any time we have this argument (no matter how logical or quiet it is) she starts crying and sobbing. After the 10th time this happened, I called her out, and she stopped crying immediately... She refuses to go to the library, coffee shop, apartment complex's study lounge, etc. 

My boyfriend and best friend have seen the text conversations between me and my roommate, and agree that she is completely irrational and does not ever respond logically to any argument.

Friend roommate and I have already started avoiding coming home, having people over, etc. Basically tip-toeing around our roommate. We have never had a party at the apartment, or more than two people over at one time. 

Should we be doing this? On one hand, I want to be courteous, but on the other hand, I pay my rent and deserve to sit in the kitchen and have a conversation, use the living room, etc. 

I know this is a really long rant, but it's been 4-5 months in the making. After working really hard with her to try to actually be friends, make everyone come together after 2-3 'falling-outs', etc... I'm just so fed up nothing I do fixes anything!

Basically I have a weak bladder and I'm prone to urinating myself and not not being able to make the toilet in time on rare occasions. (I know I have weak pelvic muscles after recently going to see the doctor about it.)

I was out with my boyfriend and his friends house having dinner, after I finished my meal (it was coconut curry for those of you who are foodies) I had a really powerful urge to pee and when my bladder warns me I have to dash to the toilet. I ran upstairs and I didn't make it to the toilet and peed on myself, soaking my clothes. I told my boyfriend about this issue, he was understanding and we left pretty soon. I went back to his house to have a quick shower, change of clothes and borrow some of his boxers as I had none to wear. I had a change of jeans left at his from another time. 

So this is where it gets a bit silly. I washed a load of my clothes this morning, including the boxers. Once the washing cycle was done, my mother on the off chance took out the clothes and folded them for me whilst I was out. She told my sister about what she found and didn't speak to me first. All I got was a text off my sister saying 'you're in trouble' and another text from a whatsapp group with me, sister and mum saying 'I found a strange item in your washing'. I was quite miffed that she decided to let me know through that way and not talk to me personally. My mother is a very traditional Christian, so her views are very different to mine, different generations etc. 

I spoke to her through text about why I had my boyfriends boxers in my wash and I told her the what happened about my weak bladder. She was far more concerned about why I was wearing boxers and if that was her in the situation, she would go naked. I guess she expected me to just stay in my soiled clothes and not freshen up or something?! She then told me she wasn't happy with me and I told her I didn't do anything wrong and I can't keep living to make her happy. She then proceeded to tell me I'm not being careful and that's how I'll get infections and diseases if I borrow my boyfriend's underwear. At this point I just ended the conversation because of it's riduclousness.

I don't know where to go with this relationship I have with my mother. I'm not in the wrong am I? Also, yes this is a legit situation I'm in. I'm off to traveling in 6 weeks time and she doesn't treat me my age or just expects me to follow her way of living.

Since I was ten, I had the habit of always being clean, and organized. At first I thought I was crazy for having the uncontrollable habit, but my older sister (20F) clarified that it was normal to shower regularly, brush my teeth, and do other sorts of washing.

**Here's the problem**.

My dad simply thinks that I am really picky about being hygienic all the time. I got into an argument awhile ago about cleaning my coat because it smelled bad and I wore it for two weeks,  most at school. My dad claims that he hasn't washed his coat for a year or two, and that I didn't need to either. 

It expanded even more with cleaning my room every week. I clean things that are lying around and organize any mess has accumulated over a week. 

There's so many examples I could list. I know I smell sweaty + my odor stinks up, I'm aware that no one wants to shake my hand if I take a shit and not wash it, and I'm definitely aware that no one wants to walk in to a pile of mess (especially my mom). My dad says that my standards are too high, and we are both getting pissed off at each other.

**tl;dr**: I like to smell and be clean + organized. Dad thinks I'm over the top when it comes to standards. I acquire assistance. Am I doing anything wrong!?

28240,Non-Romantic,2pocvf,"My relationship with my mother is not the greatest, nor has it ever been. Growing up, she was off and on using various drugs. By the time I was eight, she had become heavily addicted to something (I've never known what, because she won't tell me when I ask about this part). She abandoned my little sister and me at her uncles house, where I lived until 13 - after she decided to clean up her act. I had never met him before that day I was abandoned, but thankfully he turned out to be an amazing, kind-hearted person. 

I lived with my mother for only a few years after she cleaned up then moved out at 18. At this point, she stole one of my federal aid checks I was awarded for college, amongst various other terrible things. I cut her out of my life for a couple years, but agreed to reinvolve her in my life again. I talk to her once or twice a month and I see her once a year. 

About 13 years ago, she injured her back and began taking pain killers. This has led to another severe addiction problem. She takes more than her prescribed dose, and typically over-medicates for any reason (note: she over-medicates to the point of drooling, and stumbles around like a heroin addict). She's been to rehab five times that I can recall, and has seen various different therapists. For some fucking reason, her doctors keep prescribing her way too many opiates and her therapists have never been able to persuade her that she needs serious help. 

My mother is diagnosed bipolar, though I have recently begun to suspect that there may be more going on. She has a tendency to allude to things like the end of times (she's a doomsdayer), random holistic businesses she is going to open (she's never owned a business), and all kinds of other shit that make her seem batshit crazy. I usually just let her talk about whatever bullshit she believes because the few times I have tried to gently argue with her, she became irrationally angry and called me names for not agreeing with her. 

My stepfather has been with her through most of this, but seems to have had enough of her shit. She texted me this morning and said this:

First, [stepfather] told me he had to move to [his home state]. He wouldn't tell me why, no doubt has to do with another woman. But he doesn't have the balls to tell me the real truth.

I have been really sick last few days - throwing up, bad headache, etc. Now he says going hunting tomorrow, won't be back until Saturday. He moved in to back bedroom. I need to leave but have no where to go, realized I don't have anyone. You are the only person i really have,. Are you there for me? What should I do?

I'm at a complete loss as to what to say to her or how to lead her in the right direction toward help. I don't feel as though it is my responsibility to figure out her life for her; frankly, I kind of just don't give a shit. I want her to get REAL help, but real help has never worked in the past. I don't want to completely abandon her like she did to me, but I don't have any intentions on being her crutch or another person she just uses and abuses.

28261,Non-Romantic,1xv3sd,"Six months ago, I started working as a secretary in an office building. 

The job itself is great- It's full-time, pays well, is a 10 min walk from my home, etc. Most of the people I work with are awesome and have been super friendly and helpful. However, there is one woman (I'll call her Sheryl) who I've had difficulties with since the beginning. 

I work closely with Sheryl and another girl (Margot 25 F). A few of our tasks overlap, and so I have to talk to them frequently. Sheryl has been nothing but rude to me since I started, and I have no idea why. I am well-liked by everyone else in the office. I am always polite and friendly and I don't give anyone a reason to dislike me. 

Sheryl's behaviours include talking down to me, raising her voice, whispering about me to Margot, and snapping when I ask her questions. She is extremely abrupt and abrasive. She is very argumentative and opinionated, and loves to contradict others (she will literally argue about anything, and loves to prove others wrong). She is supposed to cover the phones/front for me when I take my breaks, but acts like it's a huge chore/inconvenience to her. (Often she will ignore the phones and Margot has to answer them.)


She is a bully to both Margot and I, but Margot tells me that Sheryl is especially mean to me. Sheryl can be rude to others in the office, but mostly picks on Margot and I (we are the two youngest in the office, everyone else is 50 plus). 

Whenever Sheryl snaps at me, I just walk away. She has reduced me to tears multiple times, and Margot told me that she used to go home crying every day because of the way she was treated by Sheryl.

Sheryl is a cold person and a bully. She completely lacks empathy, constantly whispers complaints about coworkers and is always calling people stupid. One girl came in when I was on break, and later told me that the lady who came to the counter was really mean to me! I was afraid of her! 


I've tried killing her with kindness, and it hasn't worked. I've tried to ignore her, but it is pretty difficult because our desks are within 12 feet of each other. I spoke to HR, who told me to confront her. (I don't want to do this, because I know she will not be receptive to a conversation and it will probably make things worse.) The HR lady also told me that another secretarial position is going to be available soon, in another building. (I do not want to leave my current job- We only have one vehicle, and I would have no way of getting to the other one.) 

I'm frustrated because I like my job, but I find it extremely difficult to be around Sheryl. She instantly brings down my mood, and makes me feel like I'm bad at my job. She completely disrespects me, and I feel like there is no way to earn her respect (I am half her age, which might be a part of it?) I am starting to hate a job which I was initially so excited about. On top of it all, I think HR is looking the other way, rather than dealing with the issue.

However he had been an atheist for the past few years, so it was a little offputting. He also never, ever shut up about it. Every time he came around to visit he wouldn't shut up about the after life and this Echo Bodine chick and how it's all so great, but me and my parents listened to him anyhow.

Then he starts going on about how the end of the world is coming as predicted in the Bible, and how he'd really like it if I converted to Christianity so I'd be saved too. Previously, he'd been very staunch against Christianity because he considered it corrupt. Not anymore I guess.

28287,Non-Romantic,3bl1bc,"My daughter is 18, going to college in August.  She took a job which requires her to work summer holidays as a waitress, which means she sacrificed her family graduation party for work. (because two other family members also graduated, there's four birthdays and a major holiday and our spread-out family only gathers twice a year in entirety.)

This job should net her enough spending money for the rest of the year.

Her very close friend, teammate, etc., of 110 people in her class also got same job but worked there last year and is in charge of scheduling.

This friend has herself working almost three times more than my daughter, along with everyone else (6 girls).  So basically, out of six shifts, everyone works all six and my daughter works 2.5 shifts per week.

My daughter asked politely to be put on more shifts.  The girl in charge said no.  My daughter is working double shifts during major holiday to cover for the others who are going out of town while my daughter misses her family party.

They already had their family graduations which we attended and gave money to the graduate.  My daughters party is a ten hour drive away.  No one from here is going nor invited to go to far-away party.

Here's some more back ground:

My daughter has made the mistake of offering our life-style perks to her friends since she moved here in 3rd grade.  Meaning, we are the rich family.  Puke, but what I mean is, we generously (her dad, really, not me because we are divorced) hosted weekends on our lake, boating, wave runners, parties, etc., all of which were grossly taken advantage of by all.  Fine, my ex and my daughter set themselves up for that.

Also, my daughter must've opened up her mouth about her college savings we have for her.  Her college is paid for.  Even before she goes.  But it's reserved JUST for tuition.  She has to pay for everything else, basically.  We parents no longer have hardly any income.

To add to it, this friend of hers are co-validictorians.  Scholarship night offers over $250,000 from local small businesses to the top ten students.

My daughter got $2500 in scholarships.  This friend got $25,000.

One last thing, on a personal level for just me, I have a part time hobby job.  I used to run this business but quit because it became more than hobby and i didnt have time so i went part time.  It changed owners and I saw my 20 hours a week turn into 9.  When I inquired, the answer was because you don't need the money like xyz does.

This totally pissed me off because xyz is a horrible worker with zero credentials and her presence hurts business.  Plus, she is kid-free, and as far as anyone knows, I have four college-bound kids.  This daughter is the first and in five years the last will go.  Who the heck even knows I don't need it?!

I never spoke of my savings to anyone, but small town, gossip runs rampant and that isn't exactly wrong.

Anyway, my daughter deserves to not be discriminated against because of others perception of her financial background.

She is fine at her job, just like any other teen they always hire every summer.

To add a tiny complication, this fall, I will be getting married and moving in directly next to the friend's house.

So when she told me her other friend said that this scheduling girl said derrogatory remarks about how my daughter doesn't need the money as much as she does, I recommended first, that she hear that from the horse's mouth.

My daughter texted her.  The response was yes, she did intentionally schedual her for less hours because she didn't need the money.

This is really the only time that works, as I can't take time off of work, and if I wait any longer I won't be eligible for the pill and would have to have a surgical abortion.

I have been in abusive relationships in the past, and I was single for 2 years before meeting him. In that time I got very accustomed to being alone and independant. Due to our unique situation my partner and I have moved quite quickly in traditional terms, although to us it seemed very normal. He moved in with me in our first week of dating.

Adding a new person, whom I care for very very much, into the picture has just shot my stress through the roof and it is starting to manifest in late-night fights and random crying fits. I don't know why they happen, and even when I try to stop them I can't. Last week I had a very bad break, where I went completely numb for 2 days and he didn't know what to do. It breaks my heart when I can't return his well-deserved affection - which makes my stress worse. 

At first my partner handled my episodes very well. He wouldn't get angry or raise his voice, he would remain calm and talk me down. He wouldn't try and make me feel guilty. I've always told him to just give me time and reassurance. The last few weeks I noticed he's started to snap bitter replies, he's getting frustrated and the reassurance is gone. I feel like he's trying to make me feel as bad as I make him feel. We both feel like we have to win. I also noticed that when I'm trying to explain whats wrong to him, I usually can't get his attention unless I'm already past the point of crying (which will just train me to cry to get his attention which is the last thing I want). 

I'm afraid that my worst fear is coming true - that I'm pushing him away. And no matter how much I want to travel back in time and go back to when I didn't have these episodes, I don't know how to make them stop.

To curb the time apart, I came to England with him for 6 weeks. So this whirlwind romance of spending every day (and basically every second) together since we met is about to abruptly shift into a long distance relationship. And I don't know how I'm going to handle that. We won't be seeing each other face-to-face for 4 months after tomorrow so I don't want to leave him on bad terms and with bad memories of me. 

Edit: another little extra info note - the sexual chemistry is amazing. Or, at least, it was. Still the best sex I've ever had but my libido has just plummetted within the last 3 weeks. A lot of factors could be contributing, whether it's my depression or the new birth control implant I had put in 6 weeks ago or the fact that I've gained a few pounds. But I'm sure thats another reason he's getting frustrated towards me. We both feel unwanted right now - and it sucks.

Okay Reddit, I'm in a bit of a pickle and need some help.



I have an amazing boyfriend.   Let's call him Boyfriend.  He is absolutely lovely in every way and I am beyond enamored with him.   He is very patient and kind and accepting without being a doormat.  He makes me laugh and makes me feel safe and respects my opinions and challenges me intellectually.  All and all, he is great.  We've been together and monogamous since fall and things have, in the last month or so, started to get more serious.  I love yous are flying and out relationship is a priority in my life.



I am also blessed with a best friend.  Let's call him Bestfriend.  He is amazing.  We have SO much fun together.  Our relationship is very close as we've shared some tough experiences together.  He is my confidant and my comedic relief and I don't know what I'd do without him.  Consider him like a brother to me.  Now before you all ask: yes, we have had sex (the brother comment in the last paragraph is now super awkward... oops).  We used to occasionally hook up, but as I started seriously dating others, we talked and decided that it wasn't good for our dating lives or our friendship so we stopped.  No big deal.



Boyfriend and Bestfriend haven't spent much time together (mostly due to schedules, travel, and geography) but generally seem to like each other.  Boyfriend has expressed no qualms with my relationship with Bestfriend when we've discussed it.  He is okay with me staying at Bestfriend's house (he moved about an hour away last year) and says he trusts me. Great.



The problem:  Last year, before I met Boyfriend, Bestfriend and I took a wild vacation together.  We went to an all adult's resort and spent a week getting hammered and partying and generally being slutty (we were both single at the time).  It was a BLAST. We are both very open and the fact that we went together but not as a couple was never an issue or awkward.  So, we did what anyone would do and planned Part II for this Spring.



Then I met and fell in love with Boyfriend.



I have no idea what to do.  I have NO problem with remaining faithful to Boyfriend on vacation, with Bestfriend or anyone else.  That isn't an issue on my side, but understandably, Boyfriend has some reservations about the whole trip.  I have talked to both parties about it.  Bestfriend is amazing as per usual.  He wants to go and wants me to come (in some capacity) and to uphold my agreement to pay for half of our room, whether I stay in the room or not.  Totally fair.  He also understands that my relationship with Boyfriend is so important to me and says it is consequently important to him so we have to find a resolution.



One day in the car, during a frustrating conversation, Boyfriend blurted out Well, you could just invite me.   BINGO!  I'm not sure why that hadn't crossed my mind... I guess because we were fairly new in the relationship.  Now we have a solution, kind of.



The issue is that this place isn't cheap.  I'm already locked in for my airfare and half of one room.  Boyfriend is attempting to get vacation time, but we need to book a second room that we would share.  The cost of the trip is much more a strain on Boyfriend and Bestfriend's finances than mine... but it surely isn't nothing.  Is it a terrible move to ask Boyfriend to pick up his airfare and half of the second room?  Should I suck it up and pay for the second room entirely since this is arguably my fault?  How to I approach the money issue with him without throwing it in his face that I know this is more affordable for me than for him?  I'm worried he feels pressured to spend money he doesn't really want to just for peace of mind.   What if he can't afford it at all-- is this big enough that I need to just pay for all his expenses? Or if he can't get vacation time... do I cancel?



Reddit, HELP.  I feel like I need some outside perspective.  I realize my bestfriendship is kinda abnormal and I don't necessarily understand how Boyfriend is feeling.

28320,Non-Romantic,2ljkz3,"Hi all,

Sorry, but this is rather long, TL;DR at the bottom. 

I'm the oldest of three girls, my sisters are A, (18F) and B (17F). 

A is...challenging. Super competitive, always thinks she's right, usually irritable and difficult. She sees the world in a very black/white way.  And totally convinced she is none of those things. She's doesn't have any psychological issues or anything, just has a difficult personality. 

We've never really gotten along.  A likes structure and respects authority like a soldier. I'm more of a goofball who only pays enough attention to authority to not get in trouble. But in our mid-teens we seemed to reach a happy medium. 

Once I went to college though, the happy medium shattered. Every time I went home, A would be angry at me the entire time. I asked her why a couple of times, and she just said I disrupted the rhythm of the house. Basically my mere presence annoyed her.

Last summer A, and I tried to talk out the issues in our relationship.

Some background: during my freshman and sophomore years of college my family went through some rough times- my aunt died suddenly as the result of alcoholism, my dad was unemployed, and I struggled academically. Now my dad is working at a good job, and I've come home to study at a local university and even landed an entry-level job related to my major.

Turns out A is mad at me because she thinks I should have confided in her while I struggled, and that her being perpetually pissed at me for the last two years is no reason for me not to, since we're family. In addition to that anger, B has also told me A thinks I don't deserve my job, SO or anything positive that's happened to me since high school. 

So my question is this: how can I repair my relationship with A without just giving in to her demands that I apologize and confess all my inner thoughts? She really doesn't understand why I'm uncomfortable being emotionally vulnerable with her and insists this is why we aren't closer.

28331,Non-Romantic,23zl7f,"Breif history: 
My mother has had to put up with a lot with my step-father. She was married to him for 24 years and he was the closest thing I had to a father. They had two children togather (half siblings to me) over the course of this 24 years, he was physically and mentally abusive towards me and until recently, my mother finally realized the kind of man she married. He is a controlling alcoholic that tries to control every aspect of everyones life. My half-brother is also an alcoholic and very verbally abusive to my mother. He is a recovering addict that can't hold a job for more than a month. He is 26 and both parents enable him by supporting his bad habits. I was smart enough to move out at 18. My mother finally had enough and they divorced 2 years ago. 

After the Divorce: Recently since the divorce, she has been making some questionable decisions that I just can's support. Out of her three children , I was the only one that supported the divorce. The other two were/are on his side saying that my mother is going through a midlife crisis. 

The Problem: I'm pretty sure at this point my mother is taking advantage of me. She has made some pretty strange decisions and she tries to guilt me into supporting them. Here are a few of her choices she has made recently. 

Choice 1: About a month after the divorce, she met a guy from India online and started to financially support him by sending him money. The guy took advantage of her but I also feel it was a very idiotic thing to do. He got about $5k out of her before she found out he was a crook. I didn't find out about this until recently. 

Choice 2:About 6 months after the divorce (year and a half ago), she met another guy online, this one out of Turkey. She came to me about a month into their online relationship and asked if I would support her in going and meeting him. I Simply told he she is an adult and I support her right to make that decisions but I was not comfortable with it. She ended up going for about 3 months. When she got back I found out probably one of the worst things that could happen....happened. 

They got married. Yes, after a few months of knowing each other, they decided even though she couldn't live there and it would be next to impossible for him to get a Visa here in the U.S. because they married in Turkey, it would be a fantastic idea to marry. So of course I was confused and angry by this and I did tell her how I felt. This is when the attempted manipulation and lies really started. 

When I told her I could no longer support this life style (and by support, I mean I couldn't just be all gung ho about it and put on the smile she wanted me to have constantly for her), she would cry and tell me I was the only person that could understand. She told me that her other two kids wouldn't talk to her and told her they hated her.

I fell for it and tried to be there for her again. So last year in October, she told me she was going back again. In the year they had been apart, she would call me a few times a month crying about how he missed her husband or about how they had broken up. They broke up in that year about 6-7 times. At one point, my mom told me that she had found out he had another online girlfriend. It was basically a teenage relationship type deal. At least that is how I veiw it. 

She went back in November and was there until about febuary of this year. When she was gone, I decided to reconnect with my sister after about two years of not talking. She wouldn't talk to me because I chose my moms side. But at the same time, my half-siblings were never abused by my step-father. When we got together, I found out that in that year between the trips my mom made to Turkey, she had started to sleep with my step-dad again. So not only is she married to some guy who she breaks up with frequently, she is also committing adultery and expecting me to support it. 

Help: Now this where I need some advice. When she got back, I called her out on this (she confirmed what my sister had said) and told her I was no longer going to discuss her love life or anything related to it with her. I told her I do not want anything to do with her husband (who is still in Turkey). She keeps asking me and my wife to make a trip to Turkey with her, so at this time I told her that also wasn't going to happen anytime soon. I told her she needs to start acting like an adult and grow up. She took offense and hasn't talked to me since. 

Am I being unreasonable with this? Various people I have asked about this tell me I should support her no matter what, but I think there is a limit and I feel she is taking advantage of me.

28345,Non-Romantic,32njhi,"I can already see this turning into a rant, but I need to get it off my chest and see if anyone has feedback or can relate.

I'll start by saying this:
She is my roommate. We have been friends for about three years now. I am a quiet person and she is outgoing, but we have very similar senses of humor and a lot of the same values. She is not the type of friend who takes advantage of me; If I do something nice for her, she is always very grateful and wants to do something nice for me in return. We have great conversations together. She has told me that I'm the first best friend she's ever had. 


However, I have begun to resent her. It's hard to explain, but the things she does are subtle, so that's why I have a hard time figuring out if I'm just being overly sensitive to the whole thing.


For example: 
She copies me. It irritates the shit out of me. The clothes I wear. The food I order at a restaurant. My showering habits. The way I decorate my room. The last time I cut my hair, she cut her hair to the exact length a week later. The other day, she came into my room, saw that I was wearing a semi-nice shirt, silently went to her room, and changed into a nicer shirt. She will even change her opinions to agree with my opinions. She will repeat my words to other people as if they were her own thoughts. 


She makes subtle, negative comments about me. Example: The other day, she walked into my room, noticed a new bag I had bought, and said, Your new bag is smaller than your old one. Stuff like that. All the time. Irritating things that aren't big enough to confront her about.


She is overly-critical of everyone. I have always wondered why she enjoys seeing the negative side to every situation and every person, to the point of being cynical. She complains about people all the time. If someone so much as looks at her weird, she acts like she hates them forevermore; complete strangers! It's like she makes snap-judgements about people based on one small situation. And when I point out her animosity, she acts like she harbors no ill-feelings for them! 


She is competitive with me, academically and socially. This is the worst. We are both the same major at the same university. We both consider ourselves to be intelligent and good at our field. We have all the same classes and professors. She always wants to know my grades, which I don't tell her. The thing is, though, I'm a really quiet person, but I can make friends pretty easily when left to my own devices. Ever since I became friends with this girl, however, it's like I'm a different person in public. Whenever I'm with her (and that's pretty much all the time since we live together and have all the same classes), she has to be the center of attention. She literally pays attention to everyone but me. If I try to add to the conversation, she acts like I said nothing at all. If I try to have a side conversation with someone else, she will hear us, jump in, take over, and push me to the side. In this case, I don't know if she is aware that she does this, but it really pisses me off. I'm not outgoing enough to attempt to yell over her; it's just not worth it. So I just sit there in silence. She also pretends to know things just so people will like her. For example, if someone asks her if she likes motocross, she will go on and on about how much she loves motocross, even if she has no idea what motocross even IS. 


Lastly, she tries to get reactions out of me. I really hate this. It's like she pokes me with a stick to get me to react in the way she wants. I really resent emotional manipulation of any kind. This is like an hourly basis sort of thing. Sometimes, she will even just come in my room and stand there, staring at me, waiting for me to notice a new bracelet she's wearing. Maybe to some people, that would not seem bothersome, but to me, it's just the least humble way to go about getting approval. 


All of these things add up to one big stifling relationship. It's suffocating to be around her sometimes. I'm no longer as worried about hurting her feelings as I used to be, since now I've seen with what ease she is able to criticize others. 


I know I definitely have problems with her, but I want to know if this sounds like a toxic friend? Or am I the toxic friend without realizing it? I admit, I'm a bit stubborn sometimes and am not the most reactive person, but I do value my friends. And I've never had this problem with my other friends; we all get along almost perfectly. 

Or is this simply a personality clash? an introvert vs extrovert kind of deal?

My sister lives with me, my hubby, and our 2.5 kids. It’s a big house and she wanted to stay in the area when our parents and other younger siblings moved away, so she’s our housemate. It’s pretty awesome from both views— we get the occasional babysitter (that we can bribe in terms of favorite food or drink or dessert because I’m a decent cook) and other adult living in this house of crazy toddlers, and she gets freedom from our parents’ watchful eyes. She wants to get a tattoo? Hey, bring your bro-in-law and bond over it. Dye your hair awesome colors? That’s amazing why didn’t I do that in my teen years? Gonna stay out ’til three AM hanging with your lady friends watching movies? Dude you are an adult and as long as you get home safe idgaf.

She and my husband work at a small town grocery store. He’s one of a few managers, while she’s in the middle ranks.

Last year, she revealed (after the scumbag left for work in another state) that a coworker almost twice her age had been hitting on her and making increasingly COMPLETELY gross and inappropriate advances toward her. When we, both appalled, asked why the everliving fuck she hadn’t TOLD us or the owner or SOMEBODY about it, she deflected and shrugged.

She has diagnosed severe anxiety and does take meds for it. Since getting the meds, she’s been more outgoing (though that’s around the time that she moved in with us so maybe it was a combo of that and freedom?) and putting herself out there and confident. She’s been HAPPY. However, one thing that hasn’t changed is that when she has a real issue in front of her, she will not talk about it to someone who can actually do something about it and will do nothing even as the situation escalates. Usually it’s just money or in hindsight silly family problems. But this?!

This past week she came home from work in a super pissy mood, and revealed to both of us that two new sexual harassers had been at it and were only growing worse:

* The meat manager. He’s been there for over a decade and is old and crusty. She’s one of the few people trained in meat (it’s a really small store) so she frequently has to work with him. He often propositions her and corners her and ‘compliments’ her in ways that she is so uncomfortable with.

* A random regular customer. She suspects he’s homeless, always smells like shit, and he will corner her when she’s just stocking things and DEMAND she take him out to the movies. He evidently goes on about how sexy she is and how he’d love to undress her with more than just her eyes.

WHAT THE EVERLOVING FUCK.

We managed to hash out a few definite things in the blow up conversation that followed her confession:

* My husband is not allowed by policy to do anything about the customer unless he witnesses it. Evidently the CAMERA EVIDENCE isn’t enough to convince the owner. He also doesn’t work with my sister often but promised to keep an eye out for the guy. He can't do anything about the other manager because he has seniority and will deny it.

* A couple of coworkers have noticed that the meat manager is super creepy and tried to tell the owner not to schedule my sister in the meat room anymore(with vague reasoning; not “he’s fucking sexually harassing her”), but he brushed it off and said “if there’s a problem she will come and tell me.”

* My sister does not have any confidence with regards to telling them to fuck the hell off and just freezes or smiles and tries to laugh it off.

I am not going to let her get raped in the parking lot after closing one night. I gave her an ultimatum, which I really really hope I don’t have to follow through on: Tell the boss about the sexual harassment on both fronts when she next works on Wednesday, or I’ll call our parents on Thursday. She’s an adult, and an adult in this situation NEEDS to stand up for herself, or I’m going to straight up have to put her safety first.

My parents will raise holy hell, and my sister will hate me so much for it. If it were harmless light flirting it’d still be gross, but she’s been cornered several times and dreads going to work because she thinks they may force themselves on her when there’s nobody else around— and the camera’s aren’t *everywhere* in the employee-only areas. My husband confirms there are none in the meat room.

28394,Non-Romantic,3bjl4a,"In April, I got an email about an interesting job opportunity. I interviewed for the position in May, and after several weeks of back and forth, I was offered the job. I accepted immediately. What followed was several weeks of discussion about my start date. 

First they said it would probably be June 15th, then they told me not to give notice of resignation to my then-employer until they had a firm start date. 

Then they were deciding between June 22nd and June 29th as my start date because they had to let someone go and weren't sure when they were going to do it. 

I finally received a firm start date of June 29th and I gave notice to my then-employer that my last day would be June 19th (I planned it so that I would have a week off in between jobs). 

On June 23rd, they called me asked if I could start on July 6th instead. They told me the person they were letting go had to cover someone's vacation and they didn't want me to hit the ground running. I was peeved, as I hadn't expected going that long without a paycheck. I asked if there was anything I could in the interim to start the week of June 29th (setting up my office, training) and they scheduled some remote training for which I would be paid. I was told that because they hadn't fired the person who I'm replacing, they didn't want me in the office until she was gone. 

Fine. I was able to move some finances around, and seeing as I had an unexpected extra week off, my sister and I made plans for her to come visit me (she lives 3,000 miles away and I haven't seen her since Christmas).

28405,Non-Romantic,3gancv,"alright reddit, I screwed up big time. last week my best friend calls me as I'm with my girlfriend to tell me that him and his girlfriend broke up. that sucks I thought, told him I'm sorry and that if he wants to grab a beer later to talk we can. we hang up, my girlfriend is of course curious about the conversation so I tell her. she's friends with his now ex girlfriend. She immediately texts here apologizing asking if she's okay.

this is where the fuck up happened. he didn't break up with her. for some reason he just told me he did, didn't actually do it and his girlfriend had no idea it was going to happen. so that causes a huge fight between them and then the actual break up takes place. he no longer speaks to me, wants nothing to do with me. 

He also didn't tell me he was pissed. so the following day me and him make plans to grab dinner then head out for drinks. he seemed off but I assumed it was just because of the breakup. I find out that he's upset with me via 3rd party. he didn't tell me he was upset with me, just made a few snide remarks when we went out for drinks, then his other friend who meets us there basically tells me I'm a huge piece of shit for causing the breakup. 

so now I feel like a complete asshole, I've texted him a few times and gave him a few calls. he hasn't answered anything.

---

My aunt died suddenly when she was in her early 30s.  She left behind three very young girls, and my grandparents moved across the country to be closer to them.

My uncle remarried several years later, and this triggered something of a family schism.  My grandparents had actively participated in raising the children for several years, and they felt that my uncle and his new wife were a bad influence.  For example, they criticized them for moderately consuming alcohol in front of the children (my grandparents are socially conservative in that way) and other things like that.  I was very young at the time (12 or 13), but I identified with him and said several times to all parties over the years that I felt my family was being mean to him and that these were his children to raise.  (I was a very opinionated child, and arguments like this were common in my household.) He once expressed to me years ago that he appreciated me standing up and speaking in his corner, and as far as I know I was the only person in the extended family who ever did.

The situation escalated.  I am a little hazy on the details but I believe my uncle cut off contact with the rest of the family for a period of about 10 years.  It sounds harsh, but I honestly think he just didn't want to hear their constant criticism at every family gathering and having experienced some of that myself growing up, I don't really blame him.  As I have grown older I have placed some distance between me and my family over similar criticism about my life, although I haven't cut contact or anything like that.

*The present situation*
---

Years later I am getting married and I invite the entire extended family, including him.  To everyone's surprise, he and his kids both come.  You can tell that relations are strained but everybody is polite about it and glad to see each other after so long. 

I cannot be sure, but I wonder if he came because he didn't want to hold my parents' and grandparents actions against me, or out of respect for me speaking on his behalf all those years ago.  I feel like coming to my wedding was his way of testing the waters a bit and I want to make sure I respond positively.

Now I am writing the thankyou notes, and I am looking for the right thing to write in his.  I want to in some way acknowledge that his attendance breaking a 10-year silence meant a lot to me, and that I'm still in his corner like I was all those years ago, and that I am not aligned with the forces of criticism even though I was raised by people who were.

However, I don't want to make overt references to the whole argument and subsequent estrangement as it may reopen old wounds and it's not really appropriate material for a thankyou note.  At the same time, phrases like I appreciated celebrating this important milestone with you sound cliche and like they could apply to anyone.

28434,Non-Romantic,1xpyxq,"I am trying to keep it simple.

My friend S, who I met about 10 years ago, got married four years ago and I was invited to her wedding.

I also befriended her younger sister L as we found we had many things in common.

When I had returned home, L and I talked on the phone several times; actually, L was usually the one to call me, because while I was working, she was still in college (she did two degrees, one after the other, at the time this happened, L was 25) and had more things to do in the evening, like being a bartender at her college's studen bar, study groups etc. She also had/has a large group of friends, so was usually out at night and on weekends. Yet still she always told me that those friends were not real friends, and that she had to pretend in front of them, and that I was one of three people in the world whom she could be herself with.


Anyway, usually when she called me we spent hours talking, sometimes even up to seven hours(!!) and ending at about 3 am. At first, she would casually flirt with me and tell me about all the exciting things she was doing, picknicks with friends in the middle of the night, organizing her college's game nights, singing in bands and all the people she met, yet, she would always complain about the direction her life was taking, her family, how S was so perfect to her parents and how L could never live up to their expectations etcetera. It usually ended with L being in tears and hanging up in the middle of the conversation because no matter what I suggested, how much I sympathized or agreed, everything always seemed to get worse the longer she would talk about it.

I decided not to talk to her much any more, because a) she was keeping me awake during the week while I had to be at work at 7 am, b) any comment or suggestion I made to help her would be teared to shreds or I just don't understand and c) when I finally contacted her parents, who I am also friends with, because I was so worried she would harm herself, she accused me of backstabbing, yelled at me on the phone for being a traitor and did not pick up when I tried to call her back. It made me lose sleep and I just could not deal with this any longer.


It all came to a head when I visited S and S's husband for their 30th birthday party. I stayed the night at S place and the next day, I drove L home because I figured things might have changed and also because during that birthday party things seemed to have gone back to normal.

Since I also was/am friends with her parents, I spent the night there. During that time, we got talking, and once again she started complaining about her parents and how they must hate her, and never understand her.
I finally asked her what she expected of me, and that I found it hard to deal with this because I liked her parents as well. Big mistake!!

She lay into me until I was reduced to tears, and almost driving into a bridge on the way home because I was so shocked and hurt, and that was the day I finally concluded that I was better off without her. We have not had contact since.


Fast forward to yesterday (two years later):
S is pregnant and expecting her baby in April. I am really happy for her and her husband, because they've always loved children. Over the years, the contact has dwindled to almost nothing, which I regret, so I was glad she was calling me up again.
S informed me that L was planning a baby shower for her, and that I should expect an invitation from L any time soon.

Now, as I said, L is not one of my favourite people any more, but S is not aware of this. I carefully mentioned that L might not, after all, be all too happy to see me, to which S replied you know how she is, just don't think about it.
Again I said that I would love to come, but did not know how to approach L, and since she was also sending the invites and preparing the shower, it might lead to complications.

This is where the issue lies, because S said in no uncertain terms if you want to come, fine, but if you want to be my friend, you have to get along with L.

I undstand that S does not want to exclude L, especially if she is planning the baby shower and whatnot, but how do I keep S as a friend without letting L back into my life?

**tl;dr**: M friend S is having a baby shower organized by her sister L. L and I used to be friends, but for several reasons, we fell out and have not been talking for years and I don't want any contact with her.

My parents divorced in 2010, I was 11 at the time. Both of my parents said that I never really showed that I was too affected by it, compared to my brother who is 4 years older than me. When my brother and I were told they were getting a divorce I vividly remember my brother crying, while I asked questions, what is going to happen, what does it mean? Etc.. But both my mom and dad say that I never really showed too much emotion then, and even after. Just recently my mom told me she was always concerned about my lack of emotion on the subject, in fact, apparently my extended family was as well, they all thought it was so odd that I was more or less neutral about the whole thing.

After the initial break up I lived with my mom as I didn't really know I had a say. Then, one day at school, I was talking to a friend whose parents also happened to be divorced, and some how it came up that at the age of 12 I could have a say in where I wanted to live. After hearing that, I asked my mom about it and she said that she assumed I had known, even though she had never told me about, so I think she was lying about that. Since I was only seeing my dad once a week and every other weekend I jumped at the opportunity to live with him, so I did exactly that. On a side note, my dad and I always used to fight when my parents were together. I had a really bad temper(which I no longer have) and so did he. The fights would often result in me climbing out my window to the roof out of fear. Once on the roof I would call my mom at work while crying uncontrollably. This would happen often. 

My mom is also a nurse practitioner, and my dad is an electrician. My mom has a wealthy brother who bought her current town home for her which she absolutely could not afford on her own, and she pays him minimal rent, something like 550$ I month I believe. Where as my dad at this point in time was living in not the best of places. All of which will come into play later. So, back to me moving in with my dad. Once I moved in it was going well, no more big fights like we used to have or anything of the sort. So I would see mom 1 time a week and every other weekend, with flexibility, so sometimes it was more days with mom during a week, but usually just 1. One night me and my dad were driving home and we got into an argument about me going to the doctors. I had originally wanted an appointment, but no longer felt ill, so I asked him to cancel it. To which he freaked out about and after throwing my shoes and back and forth pushing, he hit me. I called my mom from outside to pick me up from my dads as I didn't want to go inside out of what was maybe fear. After I told her what had happened, police were involved and just like that there was a child abuse case against my dad. I was not allowed to see him, or speak to him until it was over. After my mom saw how hard I was taking it she dropped the case after 10 months and I could see him. I felt really guilty for the whole thing by the way, and I think I still do today, which is what is causing part of my problem I think, but I'm not sure. 

After going back to live with my dad I remember constantly hearing from him that the only reason my mom kept me there and pressed charges in the first place is because it would force him to pay child support for me.(which was more than he had to pay for my brother who was living with mom full time and barely saw my dad. I think that he had to pay 800$ for me, and 150$ for my brother, but don't hold me to those numbers). 

My mom and her mom both used to talk a lot of shit about my dad, which would infuriate me and cause me to say something back, but it is better now though the odd thing is still said. This next part is what my dad had told me, I don't know if it is true or just what he is telling me. Apparently he couldn't afford to pay my mom the child support, so his license was suspended(that part is true). And he was giving half of his salary to my mom each month(he showed me a pay stub and it looked to be true). So he is basically making barely enough money to live off of, let alone pay child support, alimony and support me. 

At this point I feel horrible for him, I never ask for anything now, as I feel that it is a bother, even for school supplies. So my brother basically never sees my dad anymore and my brother is feeling neglected, like he doesn't have a dad. But I mean, my dad tried for a long time to get him to come over on his scheduled days, which was once a week. But after my brother put friends and other things before my dad (my mom has told him a lot of stuff my dad has supposedly done, again, I never know what to believe, which had made my brother basically hate him) he has basically given up and they barely even talk unless my brother needs money. The last time he came over for dinner was 3 or so months ago I believe, or even longer. I also feel bad for my dad about this, he basically lost a son. After hearing court related stuff from both mom and dad I never know what to believe. 1-2 years ago my dad moved about 30 minutes away from were my mom lives(my home town, since I was born) which has created even more problems. That just adds to my brother not visiting. 

My dad also lives with his girlfriend and her daughter who is 11 years old. My dads girlfriend, Jill, also has a tendency to to say rude things about my mom, stuff relating to the court related stuff and what kind of stuff she should be doing for me(example, when my mom and dad meet my mom doesn't meet half way, and her reasoning is that it wasn't her choice to move 30 minutes away) and Jill comments on things like that. My moms boyfriend, Dave, has made a few comments about my dad, but nothing too big and not often at all. 

Now that we are up to speed, about 2 weeks ago I overdosed and was sent to the hospital. My mom, grandma, and Dave were very supporting, not joking, and very open to talking to me about what went on and trying to help me. After I avoided telling my dad about my OD, my mom finally told him. I then kind of avoiding going there, fearing what was to come. Sure enough, when I get to my dads house, the jokes begin. (by the way, one of the pills I took was Valium that was prescribed to my dog for thunderstorms) Some comments were made about how I took pills and it was stupid as was I for doing it. Jill who by the way used to be a social worker(don't ask me how in the fuck she was one) was making a lot more comments than my dad was. One common comment between them which was said a few time was the fact that I took dog medicine, after trying to explain that it was valium, which is actually often prescribed to humans, they just laughed and made jokes about how I took dog medicine. They were talking about going out that night aswell, then Jill made a joke if they were allowed to go out or of they'd have to hide all of the pills in the house. Are we going to have to hide Hudson's(her dog) meds? Can't have you taking those(Hudson takes them for seizures) The fact that they were making so many jokes about it and saying I'm never gonna live it down because it was so stupid just angers me. I tried to not go there for a while to avoid whatever was coming next. 

After going back a few times, they seem to have left It alone, for now anyways. No jokes were made on my moms side by the way, none. As another side note, my dad has always been saying that my mom wants me over there so he has to pay child support for me, that she doesn't really care about me. Although I believe that she actually she does, the things she does, the way she acts, it seems like she does really care. I think that maybe my dad is projecting his insecurities because that's what he is doing? When I stayed at his place last weekend and I left on Sunday as opposed to Sunday morning he got kind of angry it seemed, and he makes jokes about how he never sees me, well I think if he really did he wouldn't treat me the way he often does. I have spent most of September at my moms house, although when I do visit my dad there is ALWAYS, and I can't stews this enough, comments about how my mom is trying to scam him for more money, one way which includes having me at her house house a lot. 

So I now have a child lawyer who I've talked to 2 times and she basically speaks for me in court, after collecting information from me she tries to figure out what I want and what is best. I have to talk to her 2 more times I believe and I am sometimes afraid of what to say as I don't want my dad disappointed in me or upset, but I obviously can't say that. If he loses me, who does he have? He lost my brother, him and his brother are in a fight right now I believe, and his other family lives out east. He will have Jill, that is it. Which I don't really want to happen, but when I go there I usually feel like shit quite often and have gone to bed crying, that NEVER happens at my moms. 

My girlfriend tells me to live with my mom because she thinks it's what I really want and it's best for me. But for the life of me I can't stop feeling guilty, shitty, and responsible, my girlfriend says that I need to stop feeling bad for my dad because he makes me feel bad often(which is true, but he can be really good and nice sometimes, he really can. He isn't terrible all the time, he's usually nice, but at my moms it's like always niceness from everyone around me). My mom depicts my dad as the bad guy, my brother believes that. My dad depicts my mom as the bad guy and I don't know who to believe. I don't want to take sides, I don't want to hear all of this bad shit about them, I'm 15, yes I'm not a kid, but that doesn't mean I want to or need to hear all of this bullshit and constant complaining and how much of a cunt money sucker my mom is, or how my dad doesn't pay attention to his kid, or pay for anything. I DONT CARE. Sort it out yourselves like adults, Christ. I am tired of this shit.

Using a throwaway because friends know my real account and I'm actually really embarassed to be in this situation.


I'm going to use real names because, why not?


TL;DR: BF prioritised his dream girl over me and I'm ready to walk away from the relationship.


So I've been seeing this guy, his name is Bob. We've been togehter for about three months now. He's pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a guy. Kind, sweet, thoughtful, gentle, open and honest with pretty much everything. The problem starts here. Sometimes he's just too honest. Bob doesn't have a lot of relationship experience, as I'm only his second girlfriend and I've dated quite a bit in my teenage years.


Bob has told me almost daily in the first two months about this friend of his, her name is Sam. There was another girl as well, but my story isn't about her. He had been head over heels in love with Sam for over six years - they met in high school. To the point he admitted to me that his only regret in his life was upsetting Sam when they went together to prom. He says that in the past year he's noticed how horrible of a person she is, and it's true. He made a few moves on her over the years and she rejected him over him not having a six pack. She will readily admit that she finds him attractive though, and flirts with him constantly. She's vain, selfish and all of his friends hate her. Even his mother told him she hopes he never dates her because it's obvious that she's just using him. He has also admitted that he cannot talk about his relationships with her beucase she says mean things about the girls he dates, including myself. Needless to say, I do not trust this girl.



Now you may be asking, Why did you agree to date him then?!, which is fair. Well, about a month before he asked me to be his girlfriend, he had stopped talking about this girl pretty much completely. We did have some other issues with him being overprotective over his ex girlfriends (even the casual ones) over something I had said in passing, again another story. I told him how uncomfortable it made me and even suggested breaking up so he could sort out his feelings. He refused the offer, insisting he was over her.



This brings us to yesterday. Bob has an active case of mono, and has been sick for weeks. He told me casually that he was having Sam over for lunch at his house, for an hour tops. Bob and I had actually made plans for that afternoon, which he ended up blowing me off so he could have lunch with her. He knew very well how uncomfortable I was with the situation and he decided to have her over anyway. Red flag number ten about this girl. He left me saying that he would be in touch soon.



Over five hours goes by. Nothing. I texted him about how disappointed I was that he was continuing to blow me off for this girl. He replied saying that she was just leaving and that he was sorry for stressing me. I ended up in the ER last night. I have a history of stress-induced seizures and what he did yesterday on top of other issues in the relationship (long story with his mom not liking me and Bob constantly taking her side, and lack of communication on his end) just pushed me over the edge.



So Reddit. Am I well within my rights to break things off with him? Last night I texted him from the hospital (he did ask if he could come visit and I said no) telling him that I thought it would be best for him to take time off and think about his feelings for Sam and get back to me when he is ready. Today he asked me if I could talk tomorrow (I'm working 12 hour shift today and will be exhausted after). Should I even bother? There's about two months time until I'll find out for sure if they messed around (she'll also get sick with mono). I don't think I can handle thinking about the what if's until then.

It started out by her saying she would see them driving slowly by the house, which I practically dismissed because it makes sense to an extent that workers comp would want to make sure she's not faking her injury and living an active lifestyle (which she does not, at all). This then progressed to her being followed when she left the house to go to the store or to pick up her granddaughter from school. Soon after, she began turning off her phone every time she left the house because they were tracking her using GPS (she still does this anytime she leaves...what's the point of having a cell phone?!)
The most recent incident which led me to writing this post completely defies logic. There is a single man that started attending her church a few months back, apparently he fit in quickly and began playing guitar in the church band. She happened to see this man at Cosco, one time and believes that he followed her there and followed her around the store. Also, she believes the reason he began playing in the church band is so that he could video her from on-stage, she says she saw him holding a video camera on her. 
She ended up talking to the pastor and says that the man now avoids her (who wouldn't?!) and she uses this as proof that he was spying on her...he was caught, she says. Mom is upset that the pastor didn't kick the man out of their church. My dad (63M), they are married, tried to talk her out of addressing this with the pastor (he also thinks this is all crap) but she doesn't listen to him and will get LIVID if he questions what she knows to be true and doesn't take her side.  

Am I missing something, does workers comp go through these lengths to force people into paranoia?? It is very clear she is not faking the injury..she stays home all day, every day with the exception of going to a store or to church occasionally. Why would they follow her for almost 2 yrs when she has the same routine, day in and day out. 

I'm concerned that she is going down a path of mental illness that is getting worse but I nor my dad can get her to realize she may need some help. My dad thinks that once the workers comp case is settled this will all go away but I'm not so sure. This is negatively affecting our family and I'm truly concerned that if we don't nip this it will get worse, How can I get my very stubborn mother back down to reality or to seek some help for this? My dad and I have talked about ways to more or less trick her into getting some help but I just don't think that will work. 
Please, need advice!!!

TL;DR; My mom has worrisome paranoia about being spied on by workers comp and refuses to listen to any logic.

28480,Non-Romantic,2m95jl,"I started this band over five years ago with my sometimes jam partner. It was understood that we were going to try and grow as musicians together, and I assumed the role of creative control after going through two bassists (I play guitar/sing/write the music). We've spoken openly about this and he's okay with me writing the songs for many reasons, mostly because he plays the drums and can't write the music. I always ask his opinion and he helps formulate the songs.

He's always been a little crass and, for lack of a better way to describe it, bro-jock like. That's just who he is and I've gotten over it, but he is unable to communicate on the same level as others simply because he's not in the same intellectual level. I don't hold his against him, but he also has a massive ego and isn't very socially appropriate, so I've had to explain to him that he should refrain from impulsively speaking in public, lest he continue to spout off incredibly offensive misogynistic language, etc. I'm offended by this behavior and it still continues, despite my urgings to stop. He doesn't know he's doing it and it just keeps happening inadvertently. 

Because I've maintained creative control (and he's never been able to hold a job for more than a year), I've taken oven most all of the financial burden for our band. This is easy, most of the time. But when we record albums or make merchandise, etc, he promises to help then pays half what he promised and the studio/myself have to wait another 3-4 months for him to pay the rest (we're talking less than $200 here). 

We haven't been able to tour because the first three years we were a band he was on felony probation and couldn't leave the county. Now, I've received promises from other member that we'll save up for a van, and I believe the others are going to do so. However, he is dodgy about whether or not he is going to commit to a $20/mo practice space because he doesn't know if he can handle the financial burden. I wouldn't mind so much if he didn't spend so much money on THC products and other substances popular with EDM culture (our band is NOT associated with EDM). I use recreational substances responsibly from time to time, but I don't have budgeting issues because of it (ie, I don't have a problem paying my phone bill cause I bought weed). 

He has problems paying his phone bill, leading to weeks without communication. Ive talked to him about this multiple times. Each time, the communication improves for a few months before tapering off again. Sometimes we'll try to schedule practice all week, only to have him show up at the house saying Oh, I thought we were gonna practice today. We had tried to schedule, but eventually we just can't plan our lives around when things work for him. 

He refuses to confirm shows, stating he might have something going on that day, let me check with my girlfriend. He uses this as a tactic to deflect not wanting to play certain shows, because his girlfriend doesn't care. He just never answers, and then we have to wait days to hear back. It's very unprofessional to keep a gig offer open that long. 

He's an excellent drummer and a longtime friend. Also, there are  very few people who could take his place in town (we live in a smaller town). There's no way for me to ask him to resign that wouldn't hurt him deeply and lead to an uncomfortable confrontation. I've assertively talked to him about all of these issues before, but they keep arising. In his defense, he is incredibly helpful logistically--he often loads gear by himself, gives rides (and often refuses gas money offered) and hosted band practice (albeit at his girlfriend's house).

My band is planning on buying a van soon and hopefully doing a sizeable tour in the summer, but I highly doubt he'll commit to it financially, and I often wonder if he'll be able to commit to it timewise. It's strange, because he says he wants to really bad. I just don't know what to do. 

**TL:DR**

My drummer is very irresponsible with money, hard to get a hold of, socially inappropriate and unreliable in scheduling, but he's a good friend, I don't want to hurt his feelings and end our relationship and very hard to replace in this town

28483,Non-Romantic,2gmorl,"Hey guys,

I've been part of this community for a while and I respect a lot of people's advice in this sub. Thank you in advance for your help on this.

So my friend Jess is a really smart and gentle man. Honestly, any girl would be lucky to have him. He has a PhD, he's fit, and funny. He's chill too, smokes weed and can chat about anything for hours. We have been friends for 10 years and I cherish our friendship a lot. His family is awesome too. They're generous, kind people.

Here's where it gets tricky. He has always had a hard time not getting friendzoned by girls. I do not mean to be harsh since I like him a lot as a person, but he has no.. sex appeal. So naturally, girls, me, others, just see him as a friend. And it's pretty much been the story of his life. Every crush he ever had just did not reciprocate.

Then, there are the chicks that crush on him... He attracts the desperate and the crazies, which he usually keeps at a distance easily, being the smart guy he is. The problem I'm facing now is that he met a woman I have known for a long time, and is now in a very serious relationship with her.

This woman, sadly, is very unstable. She's attractive and very educated, much like my friend Jess, but she is needy. And very emotionally unstable. She has dated 4 different men in my network ( she likes a certain type of music so we belong to the same community ).

Every on of these men she has dated, she has grown WAY over attached extremely fast, would talk forever and kids and marriage within a few weeks of dating, and overall be very VERY clingy. Always calling, constant texting, tagging these men in pointless facebook posts to showcase the new relationship daily. The tales of her over attachment still haunt these men. She's very intense, to say the least.

She and Jess have been together for a month now and she posts daily about him, how he is her reason to live. Constant over attached posts where her mother and other relatives comment on how handsome Jess is, how they're a wonderful couple, etc. All Jess does is click '' like ''.

I'm uncomfortable with the whole thing. I know my friend has been getting desperate to find a girlfriend for a while. And I understand she's educated, sweet, has good intentions, and is cute. I understand he's in his 30s now, and he wants to get serious with a girl, have kids, so on.

I'm just uncomfortable with her level of attachment to my friend already, and embarrassed with the amount of social media pictures she posts ( their first movie together, first bike ride, first kiss, first dinner, second dinner, you get the idea.. ). I'm uneasy with the fact she got dumped by yet another one of her exes 2 months ago for being so clingy, and is now 1 month into this thing with Jess.

Should I say something? I'm sure deep down he knows she has issues. I just don't understand what he's doing right now :x

Please help me. I do not want to hurt his feelings but I want him to be careful with this girl.

28491,Non-Romantic,2qj2bf,"We’ve known Betsy for about 4 years now. She worked with a close friend of my husband, Sam, and I. When they began dating he brought her around quite a bit. Things didn’t work out with them, but we still invited her to events because her and I had grown close.  Occasionally Betsy and I would hang out independently, but the majority of our interaction happened at social events that Sam and I would host for our group of friends, things like Christmas and Birthday parties, movie marathons, Game of Thrones viewing parties. 

Sam and I are one of the only married couples in our group, and we bought a large house four years ago because we love to entertain, and thought that we could probably help some of our friends out by renting a room if need be. We’re fortunate in that we have the financial stability to do such things. We had a different friend live with us rent-free for the first two years we owned our home. It was sometimes a strained situation, but our previous roommate was really considerate and helpful and also very easy to talk to. We could smooth things out when the going got rough, though it should be said that he stayed with us much longer than we had thought he would. 

Last year, the first roommate had finally gotten back on his feet and was looking to move out. At the same time this was happening, Betsy was looking for a place to live. She had made comments in passing when I had met her for dinner that she wished she could live with us. I didn’t really think she was looking for the kind of situation we were offering, in that I mean I thought she would rather have a whole apartment to herself. Eventually this turned to a more serious conversation in which she was having a hard time finding an apartment in the price range she wanted, and said to me that she really would love to rent a room from us, and that she was more than happy to pay. I told her I would talk to Sam about it, and he and I agreed that it would be a boon to have someone paying rent. I had taken a severe pay cut in switching career paths, and had gone back to school at the same time so the extra money would be most welcome. Betsy was in a tough spot financially, paying a mortgage on a house she bought with her ex husband that is also currently upside-down, and having taken a pay cut when she was fired from her last job. We get money from her, and she pays about 1/3 of what it would cost to rent a mediocre apartment in our city with all the utilities and things like cable and wifi. It’s mutually beneficial.

We sat down to dinner with Betsy and worked out a verbal agreement about how much she would be paying, how long her lease would be, and setting ground rules for basic concerns that Sam, Betsy and I may have. It was all agreed upon, and we told her that she just needed to wait until the other roommate had left. In the meantime, we agreed to allow her to use one of the bedrooms to slowly start moving things into our house. She said explicitly that she wouldn’t “move in” until she brought her bed over. I asked that she just warn me a day or two in advance so that I could make sure the room was ready for her. 

I bet you can see where this is going. She just showed up one day with her bed, and without even the day or two of warning moved in. Our previous roommate hadn’t secured an apartment yet; he hadn’t even packed a box. We were running on the assumption that she wouldn’t be here for about 3 more weeks. She was leaving a stressful living arrangement though, so we shrugged it off and made room. It was uncomfortable, and we found out recently that she was pestering the old roommate to light a fire under his ass and get him out. Things settled down though, and the old roommate was out in a week. 

The three of us participate in a meal planning service, and so we will cook and eat dinner together most days of the week. Our house is large enough that we could be in our respective bedrooms and separate floors of the house and not be in each other’s way. It’s been a good situation up until the last 2 months.

It has become apparent of late that Betsy has some serious issues happening in her life. She suffers from chronic depression, something she revealed to me in the first month or so of living with Sam and I. She is supposed to be on medication, though I don’t know what or if she’s actually currently taking it. Betsy also seems to have a pretty big drinking problem. When she drinks, she becomes a crazy, obnoxious person. She can either be a giggling, manic, babbling lady, or a sullen, mean and mouthy grouch. You never really know what you are going to get. If you don’t agree to engage in endless conversation about her and her problems then she becomes rude and mean. She’ll often exclaim “Ugh! Get a room!” when Sam and I are affectionate in front of her, or comment on how she hates us for being so happy and in love. She does this almost daily.

 I’m sure you can imagine how awkward our nightly dinner ritual has become. She’ll drink throughout the entire preparation of the meal, and by the time we sit down to eat, She. Is. Drunk. Sometimes we can’t even understand what she is trying to talk to us about and Sam and I are at our wit’s end. 

I have tried talking to her about this on my own. From the angle that she is my friend, and I am deeply concerned for her well being. She acknowledges that she’s got a problem in terms of her attitude towards life in general. She’s in a funk, she says, she’s unhappy with how she looks, how she feels, where her career is at, that she is single. She stops short of admitting she has a drinking problem, and says, “I think I have a habit, but it’s not a problem”. She’ll spend all of her money on impulse shopping sprees and pay rent late. I’ll talk to her about what’s going on, tell her to turn it around, and she’ll straighten out for a couple of weeks and then it starts all over again. It’s like banging my head against a wall, for all the good my talks seem to be doing. Sam is at his breaking point and he wants to take it from a different angle. 

Now, don’t get me wrong, Sam and I like to have a good time. I said that we host parties often, and there are much drunken shenanigans afoot. I worry that much of Betsy’s impression of how Sam and I live came from the idea that she was often only at our house for parties. We live in the “Party House” and therefore she thought it might be fun to live here too. But the thing is, that during the week when we have to go to work, and school, and be responsible adults we put the beer away and plan the next get-together. I think she was probably hiding her drinking in the first months of her residency but has become comfortable with us witnessing her downing 2 bottles of wine all by herself. We are not drinking with her on Tuesday night when we have things to do the next day. 

Sam wants to give her 60 days to clean up her act. If after the first 30, things have not markedly improved, he wants to give her 30 more to find another situation. He’s angry and on the war path. I am much more forgiving, and really I don’t want to stir the pot. I’m afraid that it will just mean that I am going to be living with a monster for 2 months as she down spirals after being told her life is falling even more apart. But, I do recognize something needs to change. 

So /r/relationships, what would you do? What would you say to your friend in this situation? Am I being too nice? Is Sam’s plan too harsh? I’m feeling muddled and I want to do what is best for Sam and I and be supportive for her because she needs that too, but I’m sick of hiding in my bedroom to avoid her in my own house.

28503,Non-Romantic,234qah,"Backstory: My sister is my dad's child from his first marriage. I am the only child of his second (current) marriage. He has not lived in the same state as her or seen her more than a few times a year since she was a kid.


So my sister and our dad obviously have some serious troubles in their relationship, which I can't do much to address myself. However, she and I have also never had a good relationship and now that we are adults, it's really getting to me.


For the entirety of my life, I have seen her about once or twice in a year for a week or two at a time, and when she is around, it really takes its toll on me and the rest of the family. She has a highly addictive personality and struggles with addiction to just about everything starting with food and going up through hard drugs. She has been in and out of rehab and jail and struggles to keep work. I don't actually know how she pays her bills these days, honestly. When she isn't around, we never ever hear from her unless she needs something.


I'm no stranger to addictive behavior myself, but I have worked very very hard to control my problems with a lot of success, and so I get very upset at her seeming unwillingness to change or really want to get better. On top of that, she has a lot of other behaviors that bother me: she can be very needy and may have some narcissistic disorder, I don't really know. She only ever wants to talk about herself, and has never expressed any interest in getting to know me at all, and as the younger sister, I sort of feel like the ball was in her courtyard when I was young, but she has never wanted to know me, even when I was very young, and knowing how little interest she has expressed even since then makes me not want to put forth a lot of effort now. Like an addict, she tries to take advantage of every situation for an opportunity or money, especially where my mother is concerned, who is very giving but can be overly trusting. She has been diagnosed with lots of things (depression, bipolar, adhd, seems like everything) to the point where I have no way of knowing what she may actually have. I honestly think if someone could explaint to me exactly what her diagnosis is and what it means, I could be a lot more accepting of her bad behaviors, but no one really seems to understand.


It's also clear to me that I have inherited a lot of the bad feelings she and her mom have for my dad because he was around as I was growing up and was more emotionally there for me. Like most teenagers, I had a bad period where I didn't get along with him as well, and I would be happy to talk to my sister about how he and I overcame that if she were willing to talk to me. He has always supported her financially, but for some reason she seems to begrudge me the physical things he has given me: tuition help, my piano, etc. Because I know about all of the things he has bought for her and that in that regard there hasn't been a big difference between us, I'm sure that what she's really complaining about is the difference in emotional support. But I have no control over that, and I think it's between my dad and her, and shouldn't involve me. It's obvious to me, too, that her mom complains about what I get from our dad, and that really bothers me, and makes me feel like a scapegoat.


It's gotten to the point where I know that my behavior is bad around her. I am basically closed off to her at this point, and even though I always try to start her visits off on my best behavior, I quickly get my fill and totally lose patience, and explode at her really easily.


I haven't seen her or spoken to her in something like two years now, and I just get the occasional update from my parents who occasionally find out what is going on with her. We've got some major family events on the horizon, and it's got me wondering about how to proceed. How much can I or should I do at this point? How do I overcome my own hardfeelings about the relationship?

28511,Non-Romantic,2soodj,"My roommate was one of my best friends since starting college. We would try and help each other through classes, he'd give me hookups to his fraternity events, I'd drive us to grab groceries, etc. I'd say it was a pretty even friendship. I always thought he was arrogant, but it didn't really effect me. Especially since I thought it was just him acting Turkish. My parents are both Turks, however I grew up stateside while he is an international student. And a dick. 

Here is why I think he's entitled. I think I'm giving all the info accurately. This may be rant-y and if it's too much, just skip the rest of the list:
-After the lease was signed, he said his mother would be visiting us for a month. He offered to tell her to stay at a hotel, but it's not like she wouldn't be home with us all the time anyway and I didn't want to be a dick so I said whatever go ahead. I have to be considerate, as a result of my stupid decision to not assert how annoying this situation is, so I can't hit my bong, listen to loud music, or really do anything social at the house. For my FIRST MONTH back at school.  
-Maybe this is a little personal, but he slut shames like no other even though he tries getting his dick wet all the time. Especially towards the girls he's slept with.
-I have a turntable and he decides he'd like to use it to. I'm fine letting him get his own vinyls and listen to mine if he wants to. So the first time he goes to try it, without me, he says it doesn't work and I see the arm thrown into some random position with the needle completely snapped off. He says it's broken and we need to get a new one. Cue him bothering ME to get a needle for MY turntable, and getting very defensive about him possibly breaking it without any regard to it working before he touched it. I let us split the cost 50/50 and he continues to treat it like shit. Holds the records by their surfaces, not put them back into their sleeves, and sometimes puts TWO RECORDS INTO THE SAME SLEEVE.  LIKE RUBBING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. We're engineering majors, and he can't seem to reason why a system with a microscopic needle running on a vinyl track would need a little more care. Thank goodness he's gotten bored of using it. 
-I don't let him smoke my expensive dispensary weed WHILE letting him have the regular stuff and he whines about it. Free weed, dude. 
-He drank all but one or two bottles of the six bottle liquor collection I had. He gifted one, so his reasoning for one bottle was such. Not the others.
-The xbox, tv, ps4 is all mine because I'm an avid gamer. He often thought locking the doors at night was being too careful until I got it into his head that it wasn't. It's a safe city but even college communities have cocksuckers and thefts are a thing.
-Always forgets to turn off the lights and tv when he's done with them. 
-I made none of the dirty dishes last quarter because my diet consisted of take out food or no food while struggling with a tough class. When the sink piled up he had the nerve to ask me to help him clean them. Then the food disposal broke because a glass fell in and he said one of us has to clean it. Yeah. Not me, bitch. He got all defensive when I said it was DEFINITELY him. All my shot and espresso glasses were accounted for and nothing else could fit. 
-He sends me a ? if I don't respond to one of his texts for a bit. Like, who does that???
-He says I'm always quiet to be around and, while it may be true, I just explain I'm an introvert (which I am) or that I'm tired. It's actually because having a conversation with him means him hating on your jokes, being dismissive of other opinions, and getting super defensive of any sort of criticism. 
-He gets really weird about me sometimes locking my door. I like my privacy. He knocks, but barges right in without waiting. 
-I don't talk about money, but whenever I get something new he asks how much it costs. I tell him I don't talk about it and ask him to stop asking but he tells me I'm being ridiculous and he keeps doing it. This he won't improve on but I think it's a cultural thing. 
-Says he'll get a license. Promised, even. He has the time. But nope. Uses me for his groceries and asks me to get shit for the house because I have a car. I've started making sure to only let this happen if I feel like getting groceries or am in a good mood. 
-He hooked me up with adderall twice for finals and a project before I got my prescription. Welp, now he's asking me for it all the time and I'll give in during finals but otherwise won't. Gets upset and explains his tough situation but if he thinks he needs it all the time he should go to the doctor. 

I can't really be too verbal about his bullshit because he refuses to acknowledge his faults at first and I don't like arguing until he sees it. I will say that he gradually gets better if you tell him and just not give a fuck about what he has to say afterwards and end the conversation. But I can't consider him as more than a roommate anymore. Thing is, he's actually really LOYAL to me as a friend. My only problem with him is how he acts, and it's made me talk shit about him behind his back. That's out of character for me so I've stopped it, but it has happened. 

Can I change how he acts? I think it would be of benefit to him. I don't want to look for a new place now or for next year because I love the location and price so much and I enjoy the challenge/life lessons I'm getting from his actions (AKA How To Not Be A Pushover). But I'd rather have my friend back.

28522,Non-Romantic,20mtgd,"My niece ran away from her home (My brother's house) in Hanover PA on March 10, at about 5:00am, and has not been seen since.
She left a note saying she was going to stay with a friend in Maryland and that she would be back in a week or two.

My brother notified the Hanover PD, but they can't do anything because she left willingly, and because she's 16 in PA she can legally make her own choices and they cannot force her to go anywhere.
They are assuming that she is traveling with a boyfriend a 20 year old male. 

Some how, according to my brother, who is a less than reliable source, the police have traced her as of Tuesday to somewhere in the Pittsburgh area. I don't know how they got this information as she does not have a phone on her with GPS capabilities, all she has on her is an iPod, which she has been using to keep in contact with myself, and myself alone.

My brother claims that this boy's ex girlfriend called and said that the boy has slapped her around in the past. And my brother doesn't have a squeaky clean record either. The reason this is being brought up, is obviously her safety is of utmost concern to me, but also, 2 days ago when I was trying to get any information out of her she dropped a bombshell on me. She said she had stitches in her face, and that she was getting them out Monday, today. I asked her to send a picture of  herself, and she sent me one, but it was only from just under her nose down. She claims it's a dog bite, and it's of 2 contusions on her upper lip, it doesn't look like a dog bite to me.

I've called every hospital in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the Maryland areas I knew she might go, and her hometown in Hanover considering stitches have to stay in for roughly a week meaning she might have had them before she left, and asked for security to keep a eye out for her and to call the cops and myself and detain her until she was turned over tot he custody of family or police should she walk in. Most places were cooperative, but I don't know how it works, or how effective it will be and that's IF we're looking in the right place at all.

Once again I don't know where Pittsburgh came from it's all second hand information and the Police refuse to tell me anything because I'm not her parents, even though I'm the one doing the most work, and the only one who is in contact with her. I have her contacting me through an IM service called kik, and she is sending me at least one message every day to let me know she's at least alive.

The police are being less than helpful and cooperative, and the man I spoke with on the phone today got shitty with me and hung up on me when I asked him to call her mother so she could give them permission to reveal details of her case to me. 
Her mother wants me to be able to help because I am the one with the most pertinent information even if it isn't much.

So far my attempts to try to convince my niece to come home have been fruitless.
My attempts to gain police cooperation have been fruitless, and it is my understanding that between her age and circumstances of her running away they can't do anything which translates to they don't care.

Her father literally could not care less, and is being incredibly vague on everything whenever I speak to him, and he's lying about trivial things. When she sent me the photo of her lip, he told the police that she called him and sent it to him herself. Instead of her contacting me and sending to to me, and then him requesting it from me.

Her mother is doing what she can I suppose, but she's not sure what all to do either, and she's not having much luck either with getting the police to work with her.

At this point I'm not sure what to do, any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm feeling incredibly alone in the search for my baby girl, and I don't know what to do, I'm getting no where fast, and I feel she may be in danger. Any advice would be appreciated.

28527,Non-Romantic,1s0bng,"I've been a lurker on this site for a while and I've decided to join. Mostly to post around and gather knowledge and wisdom from the members of this community.

First of all, hi everyone!

So, I'd like to share my story because, mostly, I want input from you guys. Things are ok in my life, but I want to improve it, and perhaps you are the best ones for this.

I'm a 21 years old guy, currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Engineering. I'm glad to be where I'm at, because if I see the positive side, I have lots of things to be grateful for. But like I said, there's room for improvement. And I want to pursue that.

I was born as a product from an extramarital relationship. My parents were lovers for 16 years. He was married with someone else until my father's wife passed away from cancer back in '93. After that, well, my parents broke up and he remarried someone else.

He is a successful man. He owns businesses (Which he built alongside my grandfather. Such companies are now 80 years old and still expanding) and he's pretty smart when it comes to money. I admire him. I want to follow his steps and replicate his success in the tech and software industry, which is the reason why I decided to study EE. 

My father and I haven't gotten along too well. He supports me and my mother financially, although he doesn't lives with us. We're pretty well off thanks to him, but he's not exactly a soft man. He's tough. A lot. That's how he was raised. He's also a demanding person and because of that, I've had to show him that I'm capable. Which I'm thankful for that, because it made me a stronger man. Still, we've had our differences in the past, which made us be separate from each other. 

Those differences include let downs from him and not living up to his promises. However, when it came down to supporting me financially, he never said no.

I don't have a job, per se. But I have done gigs here and there while studying. Mostly related to computer repair, networks and IT stuff ever since junior high. Sometimes I got lucky and got hired by a small company to set up a wireless network, clean their PC's from viruses and rescue data. Those gigs left me with some good experience and money which I reinvested in equipment and even my own custom PC. I've also done other things like bakery and sales (I had a small gig with my ex-GF. We cooked different type of desserts and sold them at our colleges. We were doing fine with that and I learned a lot about sales doing this I was able to sell about 30 or more desserts a day between lectures and I did enjoy it). I've acquired some experience thanks to that.

I don't consider myself lazy, because I've worked my ass off to have what I've got today. However, I've had certain reckless behavior a couple of years ago, which caused me a lot of problem with him. To the point that I had to drop out of college and I was this close to be disowned by him. Back then I was studying civil engineering. Thankfully, I've learned from that experienced and became more mature. I'm back in college studying what I like, with a good GPA and feeling like I have potential to achieve something great in this area.

What I do want, though, is to follow my father's steps. I don't want to be stuck all of my life working a job for someone else while he becomes rich out of my effort. I want to be a businessman, like my father. All of my half-brothers (His children he had with his first wife) also followed his steps and they're business people like him. I want to follow his steps, too, but I don't know how.

I haven't talked with him for more than a year. And last time I saw him in person was back in 2010. We had a huge fight back in the day and things got rough (It was back when I was being reckless). Like I said, he still supports me financially to go to college, which helps a lot so I can focus in learning the skills to do something useful for society and profit on that.

What I'd like your help with, guys, is: How can I rebuild my relationship with my father so he can see I've become more mature? Be advised: I do NOT want him to hand me money, as he already does enough by providing me higher education and I try to be frugal about the money and support he provides me. What I want from him is to let me be close to him and let me learn from HIM his life experiences and how to generate wealth. I've always wanted that knowledge from him, but for some reason there were always problems. Be it because of my immaturity or him having his own demons to deal with.

Perhaps you guys are in situations like my father's. If you are, I'd love your advice.

I love my father. I am grateful for what he has given me and I admire him despite the tough situations we've had and the origins of my relationship with him. What is done is done, and I have no reason to feel resentful towards him since it doesn't makes ANY sense to live in the past. Sometimes he scares me, though. I won't lie to you. Is it because he represents a figure of power? I don't know. 

What I do know is that he still supports me even if he's not present physically. Hell, he even helped my ex-gf to get an extra scholarship so she could stay in college and get her degree in Environmental Engineering. All that tells me he does care. I just want to figure out how can I tell him I want to be next to him and have a father-son relationship where I can learn from him? It doesn't help that my brothers sometimes fight between them about money and what my father might inherit them. So it's a kinda touchy situation.

So, how can I approach?

TL;DR Relationship with father is fucked up, he doesn't trust me and neither do I that much, but I've matured and I want to rebuild my relationship with him. How?",Me [21 M/F] with my Father [68 M] had a rocky relationship with him. How do I rebuild it?,0.0,False,1.0,5.0,1386094435.0,/r/relationships/comments/1s0bng/me_21_mf_with_my_father_68_m_had_a_rocky/,NonRomantic
28535,Non-Romantic,1tuu4s,"So this requires a little bit of background before I actually get into the story. I am very strongly atheist, and I am absolutly unwavering in my beliefs. I've been an atheist since I was a child. However, I am not the type of person to shove this in anyone's face. I don't have a problem with other people being religious, other than the fact that I don't understand it. 

Now, my fiance's family is moderately religious. They don't go to church every Sunday, but they apparently do go fairly often. Since meeting me almost 5 years ago, my fiance has turned from being an agnostic to being an atheist. We have gotten around the issue so far by just not talking about it. 

We normally spend Christmas day with the to-be-inlaws, which usually is a stressful day for me as I have never felt very welcomed by them. They don't try to include me like they do with their other DIL, who happens to be deeply religious. 

This Christmas, we spent some time with them in the morning, opened presents, did the throwing around of wrapping paper and all that, and then the four brothers (fiance included) went to go shooting together. All seemed well at this point, and they realized that they didn't have enough ear protection to go and borrowed some from my father. Fiance dropped me off at my parents house so that I could spend time with my family and then go home as I wasn't feeling well. 

After they all got back from shooting, finace and his family sat down and had a few beers together. They ended up asking him what he wanted to do with his life, and he replied that he is very interested in space and cosmology. His father asked him what he meant and fiance started to talk about the big bang and black holes as these are the particular fields he is most interested in. His father, sister, and brother's SO then proceded to mock him for believeing in science and not that God created the universe. They mocked him all night, even after the conversation turned to other things. 

My finace came home upset about the way he was treated, especially because he has never gotten along well with his father. The straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. 

After all of this happened, I, unthinkingly posted this image to my facebook the next morning:

http://i.imgur.com/zol3f9x.png

Which resulted in a message from the deeply religious brother about how I was disrespectful to their family and how they treat us with respect and how we don't return that, and a message from SIL (deeply religious brother's deeply religious wife) about how she thinks the same thing about atheists celebrating christian holidays. 

After hearing about all of this and becoming incredibly upset (to the point of crying for a half hour), fiance called his mother to explain why he was upset about the night before, and how we no longer feel welcome and how I have always felt ostrasized. All she had to say was that she saw nothing and that no one laughed at him, then brought up my post and how in the wrong I am for posting it, and how she wishes we would just be christians so that she can see us in heaven. She pretty much told him that she doesn't see any of this and therefore won't say anything to anyone but us. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I know I need to apologize for offending them and let them know I didn't mean any insult by it, that it wasn't directed at them. I'm just having a hard time doing it because of the uncomfortable feelings I always get from them. My fiance is extremely hurt by his father's treatment of him to the point that he cried himself to sleep last night. I am really angry on his behalf. I am also angry at religious SIL for being condescending about the fact that we came to celebrate a holiday that is important to his family with them. 

I could really use some advise here because swallowing my pride is very hard to do for me. 

tl:dr: religious inlaws attack fiance over what he is passionate about because it isn't God, and then go crazy after I post atheist propoganda

Edit: since a lot of you seem to be confused: I have done no crying. All crying was done by my upset fiancé. I actually don't feel bad about posting what I posted. Thanks for the reminder, but I do know I'm in the wrong here. I already feel bad enough without reddit making me feel worse.

28549,Non-Romantic,3abfua,"So my bf has been best friends with Gary and Mary for about 8 years. They talk almost every day and they've helped him through really hard times. I've been with my bf for almost 3 years and, due to a recent move, I just met Gary and Mary for the first time about 2 weeks ago.

I was getting along with both of them really well and could even see becoming really close with them. Mary even asked for girl time recently, which was really nice. Basically since I moved I don't know anyone here except them and they were a lifeline for me to not feel so alone.

Well I think I royally fucked that up. 

Cue us going to dinner last night. A mutual acquaintance of ours was brought up while dinner was winding down. My experience with the guy, Richard, was me meeting him once and him being just plain awful. Publicly making fun of people, cursing at people, not caring if kids were around when doing all this, just being a full asshole. 

Well come to find out after I rant about his awful behavior, he's more than just an acquaintance to Gary and Mary. They're all best friends. Like, I'm gonna send you flowers if you're feeling down.-kind of best friends. 

They started defending him, saying that he's an asshole but that he's a good person. I personally can't look at a guy that does all that shit and see him as a good person. Just because he treats a certain group of people with adoration and respect, while treating everyone else like they're shit, doesn't mean he gets the stamp that he's a good person. 

So now I think I officially alienated the only two people I've been able to connect with in this new place (not to mention my bf's best friends). I texted Gary an apology last night and he made it seem like all was well, but I'm not so sure. 

I won't apologize for how I feel about Richard, but I need them to know that I wasn't bashing them for being friends with him and that it's important to me that we all continue growing our friendship. How do I go about doing that?

On Monday, she sent me a text that said that I was just as lazy as our mentally handicapped uncle tow which I responded to sarcastically. She then sent texts saying how I was an ungrateful son and a failure. I responded with that is not true as I do very well in school. It escalated from there to the point were she turned off my phone's service and made herself admin of the computer. When I got home I was quite mad about this and told her that it was not fair and we got into a yelling fit. After a bit, it did settle down and I said I was sorry for what I had done. However, this morning I was late to school due to my phone being turned off and I tried to call her to explain the situation, but noticed that my phone no longer had service. Again, when I got home, I confronted her on this and said that it was not fair, because what if I had an emergency, needed to contact someone, or they needed to contact me. Again we got into a yelling fit, but this time she shouted things like I am a shit human being, she wasted 17 years of her life, and that I can find a place to stay this summer as she will not support me. Now she is refusing to talk to and I am really scared about whats going to happen to my future. What should I do?

TL;DR: Mom punished me for not raking the leaves, I told her that not having my phone service to contact teachers is unfair and is hurting me, she called me a shit human being and is refusing to talk to me now.

Best friend - Dave

Best friend's gf - Claire

I have known Dave for about 10 years and for nearly all of those 10 years he has been probably the only person who I felt like I could speak to about anything and everything and confide whatever I wanted in. I know he thinks similarly about me given that he has told me things that he really shouldn't have told anyone. 

He secured a good job(for an unskilled student) at about 19. 2 years later he used savings and a loan from his grandparents to get a very good mortgage on an nice house at a good price. With help from myself, his dad, my dad and his grandfather he renovated it and added a loft conversion. He could rent out the other two rooms, live in the attic and the rent would pay the mortgage payments and then some. 

Before he got that job he had previously gotten another good job at the age of 17 which about 8 months later he lost for being an idiot and decided to carry on this streak of stupidity by taking up a new career of growing weed. Long story short he ended up having $10,000 worth of weed stolen from him by some junkies after a year of living like a complete no-hoper, missing a year of university that he had to lie to get a repeat of. He ended up having to move back in with his parents until he found the good job at age 19.

My point of telling you these two stories is to tell you that my friend has very positive qualities and very negative ones, he can be very enterprising, intelligent and forward thinking or can be completely stupid and self-destructive. 

Claire enters originally as a tenant of my friends new house. She goes to some weird dancing/acting/singing school and apparently hates everyone there. At this point I don't really see him much, talk to him every now and again but I am really busy and most of the time I spend socialising are with my girlfriend and her friends. This was about a year and a half ago and lasted for about a year of us not spending as much time as we would like with each other. 

Since about 6 months ago though I have had a lot more time to offer him, I broke up with my girlfriend, moved back in with my parents(walking distance from his house(2 minute drive) and started a business which was initially a part time income earner on the side but is now full time.  

Dave had recently quit his job(i am actually not too sure if he quit or he was fired) and came up with his own business, this was about 8 months ago that I first noticed that his Facebook status said 'CEO and founder of X', which to this day has no customers, no revenue - more on that soon.

Claire doesn't do anything any more, she quit the dancing school and now wants to go back to a real school to become a nurse, but colleges won't take anyone on for another 8 months and she doesn't have a job and I don't think has ever had one. She and him generally just sit in their converted attic watching TV shows, procrastinating on facebook, smoking weed or fucking. Somehow, some way, with two people not working and spending all day in that room, the room is still impossible to walk through with all kinds of garbage and unwashed clothes lying everywhere.

This is mainly why I can't stand her, she is a complete bum and that effects her attitude. For example whenever I go round to talk to him, it is never just him, it is always her, whenever he comes round or we both go out, she always has to come with him, why? because she has nothing else to do. Why is that a bad thing? well because she doesn't really do anything or know what she wants to do so all she does is talk about obnoxious stupid things - most often and particularly, bitching about, and in my mind quite perniciously, about people who were/are close friends of his and often mutual friends. 

The most teeth gritting example of this was on a Sunday I spent about 2 months ago at his place, from the afternoon till the evening. On the previous Friday she had gone out to a club with an old ex of mine. I had actually been with her for 3 years, 2 in high-school and 1 year after, she was my first serious relationship and though she had flaws I certainly still had a lot more nice things to say about her than bad. She had recently come back from abroad and was still a very close friend of Dave, I only spoke to her occasionally. 

My ex had been spending some time with Claire prior to the Friday night, but on that Friday my ex had supposedly said something which Claire claimed was encouraging her to cheat on Dave. She had said 'what happens in (the clubs name) stays in (the clubs name)'. Now to say that this was a 'wink, wink, fuck who you want he won't know' innuendo is to me spurious at best. I have since spoken to my ex about the allegation and she was like 'are you kidding me?', which was my thoughts exactly. She was obviously just trying to be humorous. However that Sunday I had to spend the whole day listening to this and a long litany of offences that were either half-truths or wilfully misinterpreted social slights all amped up and repeated to make my ex look like some evil manipulative slutty witch. Naturally my ex no longer visits or really even talks to Dave, every time her name is mentioned around Claire, even in my presence, it is immediately slandered by her. I would hate to imagine what she must say about her when they are in private.

My ex is only one of a few of what were once very close friends of Dave who now seemingly are too busy to spend time with him, coincidentally their names are also degraded by a swamping of cruel judgements whenever they are raised in Claire's presence.  The ratio of nasty things she has said about people I and Dave like relative to the nice things must be, honestly, 10-1. The only time I can get to talk with him one to one is either messaging him on Facebook or phoning but those conservations rarely last longer than 20 minutes because 'Claire wants to watch some TV show with me, will talk to you in a bit'.

Now to the real point that I want to get across, because my friends have had bad partners before and I have usually just weathered the storm until they see the light. Dave after what is at least 6 months is now actually starting his business, Monday he is going to try and find customers. Now the business itself is interesting and I am sure there is success to be had in the field in which he has chosen to adventure but his attitude to it is really pathetic. 6 months on, does he have a website, leaflets, logos, an office? nope, nope, nope, nope, he has registered the company, written some legal contracts(he actually plans to write some crucial ones himself today) and bought a raincoat. 

What I am about to write about happened last night and is why I am writing this. He asked that in the circumstance of his business going belly up if it would be al-right if he can join mine and we can work together. Ofc I immediately said 'yes that would be great'. We then talked about it, how I can take it out of my parents garage, let them use it again and run it from his house which would be far more convenient. Truth be told, we use to always talk about starting businesses together and how amazing it would be and I do still in many respects believe that, Dave is a talented guy with skills that he could bring to the business. BUT. The way he is living like a complete loser, failing to pay proper attention to his interests, not eating properly, sleeping during the day, smoking weed, and living with someone who does all those things and probably has done little else for all her adult life + a really bad personality is just something that I don't want to gamble my business and possibly my future on. I am also fairly confident that if he gets involved so will she by default.

What the hell do I do? I don't know how much he rates his relationship with me relative to hers and I am really terrible at telling friends blunt truths, I would hate to tell him what I really think about her and have it backfire on me, destroying one of my closest relationships. Should I just tell him straight and hope he adapts or just tell him that I am doing my business solo and keep both of them at arms length or just go into business with him regardless and hope it isn't turned to shit?

So I (20F) live in a four bedroom apartment with three other women (all around my age), let's call them Rebecca, Marie, and Lisa.

Rebecca and I get along really well. My relationship with Marie is...fine. We're just kind of...roommates. We say hi and make small talk in the kitchen before class, but not much else. Lisa and I...don't really get along at all. I find her standoffish, inconsiderate, and her standards for what constitutes clean to be unreasonable. Rebecca doesn't really get along with her either, but Marie and Lisa get along really well, it seems.

There have been times when things have been really, really tense in our apartment. But right now, things seem fairly peaceful.

Last Saturday, I got a knock on my bedroom door. It's Lisa and Marie, and they hand me a piece of paper. They tell me that me, my boyfriend, and a few of my other friends are invited to a BBQ they're hosting this Sunday. Oh! Awesome! That sounds like fun! Lisa asks that I RSVP by Thursday, just so they can get an idea of how much food they need to get.

So Lisa leaves and I'm looking over the invitation, and I notice a little note at the bottom that says that all invitees and each of their guests are asked to bring $7 to attend the party, to help pay for food and drinks.

OK, so...this is weird, right? This just seems sort of...tacky. If I were to throw a party, I wouldn't expect my friends to foot the bill. And like...$7 a *person?* If I were to go to this party, and invite everyone they name-dropped when we were chatting at my bedroom door, we'd be giving them $35. That just seems like a lot of money. I mean, I would be happy to bring drinks, cups, something for dessert, but just straight money? I dunno, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and now I'm not quite so interested in attending the party.

So...yeah. What do you think, r/relationships? Is this weird? Is it bad if I tell them I don't want to go? If they ask why, what should I say? Do you think I could say something like, Hey, instead of money, how about my friends and I bring drinks/snacks/dessert? Or should I just bite the bullet and attend the party? I'm getting nervous about saying no. Things have been fairly amicable between all four of us and I'm worried if I reject the invitation, things will get tense around here again.

My buddy, who I'm in a band with, he got married in 2011 to his wife. The wedding was amazing, everyone had a great time.

Because I was an idiot, and I don't go to many weddings, I didn't get him a gift. I used to be pretty damn oblivious to etiquette, and of course, I ate his food, drank his free liquor, and didn't get him a gift. 

So like 2 years later, it dawned on me - holy shit - what a dick move, right? 

He has **never** brought it up, but I'm sure that while writing the thank you notes, they realized that they weren't writing me one, and it was probably clear to them why they weren't. 

So - to make matters worse, despite being a poor grad student at the time, I made a large purchase that one might consider frivolous about 2 months before the wedding (I should buy a boat). It was a project boat, and while I got it for a steal, it definitely exceeded the cost of your traditional wedding gift. 

I want to make it right, even if it's almost 3 years after the fact (June). 

What should I do? My thought is to figure out their favorite place to eat and give them a gift card for their next anniversary. I really want it to say I'm sorry I was a dick and I believe in you as a couple (obviously with the gesture, not with the words).

28631,Non-Romantic,3aujhb,"First off, apologies if anything here isn't clear or jumps around a lot. There is a lot of back story (basically my entire childhood) that factor into this entire situation but I'm trying to stick to the necessary details, so this doesn't turn into me writing my life story. Please let me know if you need any clarification or need anything further explained.

--------

**Basics:**

My relationship with my mother isn't the best. She's a single-parent who raised me, and my three older siblings. She's an alcoholic, and has been for as long as I can remember. It really negatively affected me growing up. I was depressed my entire teens, and was a hermit who never went out because in my mind, if I stayed home, then mom wouldn't feel the need to drink. I eventually realized I needed to get away from that environment, and ended up going to school out of state, about 500 miles away. I graduated last month, and I'm staying in this state for the time being. But I'm going home next month, and have decided that I do not want to stay with my mother (I'll be staying with my older sister). 

I need to tell my mom that, but I don't know how. I don't know how to word things, what I should include or exclude, or even if me not staying with her would be a bad thing. I don't want her to think I'm abandoning her, but I need to see some progress, some indication that she wants to get better.

**More detailed:**

My mom started going to AA during my senior year of high school, and it seemed to be sticking this time. She was doing a lot better, and was the happiest I have ever seen her. But then, through AA, she started a friendship with a woman [50's/f] who turned out to be a manipulative leech. The consensus of the rest of the family is that this woman is a psychopath. This woman eventually moved in with my mom, rent free, and just took advantage of my mom any chance she could. They are both still drinking, and lying about it.

We (my siblings, and my mom's sister) have spent the last three years trying to get my mom to see that this woman is no good. Now, this summer, my mom is moving. The woman jumped shipped recently, when she saw that the rest of the family was really starting to close in. So that solved the problem of her moving with my mom, in my mom's new house.

Now, I'm sure my mom thinks everything will be hunky-dory. But there is still a lot of trust-issues because she still picked this random woman she met in AA, over her own children and over her own sister. I don't want things to go back to the way things were when I was in high school. I think this move will be very stressful for my mom, and, once again, she'll have an empty house. I don't want her drinking to get worse, and I don't want her to pick up another stray from AA to fill her empty nest.

I want my mom to know that I'm not okay with the current situation, and haven't been okay with things for the past three years. My family isn't very good at talking about things, and I don't want things to go back to how they used to be. My older sister (the one I'll be staying with) isn't speaking with my mom right now, until she shows progress and shows she is serious about getting help and getting better, and understands why we are all upset.

So I need to tell my mom I won't be staying with her when I go home next month. I want to tell her that I won't be staying with her at all, until she starts trying to repair herself and repair the relationships with her children. I still want to see her when I go home. But the only way I will stay with her in the future, is if she goes back to AA, and starts going to therapy to deal with her issues.

I just don't know how to say things, or if I should say anything. I don't want to hurt my mom, but there is no trust left in this relationship. She chose the psychopathic woman/roommate over her own children, because the roommate was enabling her. I don't things to go back to the way they were when I was in high school, where her drinking was just the open family secret that we all knew about, but couldn't do anything about. 

I can't let things go back. I feel the same way my older sister does: mom needs to show progress and acknowledge the issues in the relationships and in our family history.

I just don't know what to say, what I should include, or even if I should say anything. My mom is in a vulnerable place right now. I don't want me saying I won't stay with her, to cause her to start drinking more or make her feel unloved or unwanted. I'm staying with her because I love her, and I feel she needs to know that her family still isn't okay and that there needs to be effort from both sides to fix our relationship.

   
**tl;dr**: Through all this rambling mess, my mom's an alcoholic who picked and listened to a random enabling woman, over her own children. I'm going home next month, and need to tell my mom I won't be staying with her.

28632,Non-Romantic,2yr4o1,"I'll try to make this quick; mostly I just need some validation. 

My best friend (we'll call her Betsy) and I have been friends for almost a decade. 

Friday night Betsy wanted me to go out to the bar with her. I live about half an hour away from town, so she offered to drive us both and be the designated driver. 

Once we got to the bar, she started drinking and eventually got far, far too drunk to even contemplate driving. Her plan for getting us home was to have a guy from the bar drive us. I had been drinking as well but wasn't buying this, so I went ahead and called my boyfriend to come get us since neither of us could drive. Frankly we were both pretty tanked.

This is where things get hairy. Betsy flat out refused to go with us, instead getting in her car and trying to leave, almost running my (completely sober) boyfriend over in the process. I finally got her keys from her and the entire ordeal turned into a crying, drunken mess. She said a lot of hurtful things to me, like that if she had known I was going to be like this (about her driving), she never would have brought me and also getting upset that guys were flirting with me and not her. Eventually she calmed down enough to call one of her other friends to come get her, saying that she didn't want my boyfriend and I to judge her for needing to be taken home.

Relevant: Betsy still lives at home with her super-Christian mom, who probably would have asked questions if Betsy had come home without her car. This is not at all what Betsy said in the moment, though, and could have been worked around (she could have stayed the night with me, for instance) if she had been rational at all.

I went home that night incredibly upset and prepared myself to have a longer talk with Betsy. That happened last night.

Last night we had dinner together. Her first words to me were Go ahead, yell at me, I know you're going to. After I explained to her that her actions made me feel like she had broken my trust, she started crying and got super defensive, saying that I'll take most of the blame for what happened, but not all of it. She basically said that I shouldn't have tried to make her leave, because I should know what kind of person she is and that she just felt attacked. Her solution was that I should have, instead, given her keys to the bartender and left her there to sober up. She didn't even remember most of what she said to me and her halfhearted apologies (that she only gave after I got angry) made it clear that while she didn't want to lose my friendship, she didn't really think she'd done anything wrong. Basically she said everything she could to put as much blame on me as possible so she didn't have to take any accountability for her actions.

At this point, I'm considering cutting her off completely. I don't want to lose this long of a friendship over one night, but I also feel like you should be able to trust your friends. I'm at a loss for how to approach this. Am I completely misjudging what's normal bar behavior? Or am I right in thinking that this situation is already a lost cause?

 TL;DR: Best friend of 10 years gets completely tanked while she was supposed to be DD, putting me and my boyfriend in danger and generally being an ass.

I have a friend named Janice. Janice and I have known each other for about 7 years now, and used to be extremely close, practically sisters. About 2 years ago, we moved into our new school dorm together, and got along fine sharing a room. However, living with her changed our entire relationship dynamic, and when a third mutual friend got involved, we tried to have an intervention with Janice about what was upsetting both of us. That backfired completely as Janice has a tendency to blame everything and everyone else for her problems instead of taking responsibility for things she does that upsets people. She only takes responsibility when she gets tired of arguing in order to get everyone to stop attacking her. Afterwards, this led to her extreme depression, thoughts of giving up on her life, and overall general concern for her on my end. (all the result of just trying to talk to her about my feelings!)

Flashforward to now, 2 years later. Janice and I have somewhat repaired the relationship, but things are sliding backwards again. Last year, she introduced me to another girl, Lisa, whom she was better friends with than I at the time. The three of us began hanging out, and Lisa and I have become pretty close. Over the last few months though, Janice has been making me crazy again, and Lisa revealed to me that Janice is making her crazy as well. I feel extremely guilty sharing my opinions on Janice to Lisa without directly confronting her on what annoys me, but I can't directly tell her because I know that she won't take responsibility and will just end up sinking back into her depression. However, it's getting extremely frustrating that Lisa and I keep talking about the things she does that make us upset and don't do anything about it. 

Janice doesn't really have any other friends besides Lisa and I. (Friends of mine that have met Janice have all said how annoying they find her, and don't know why I'm still her friend)

I'm really lost as to what Lisa and I should do, short of trying another intervention. We have also tried telling her (in as polite a way as possible) when she does things to annoy us, but it's like it shoots right over her head. She also laughs whenever we say things like that, as if she thinks we are joking.

Anna has, for the longest time, assumed she was straight. She however, about 1 year ago, started having feelings for B, but only confessed to me about 3 months ago.

She also hates herself because she's overweight, but she now goes running twice a week and is slowly losing it.

Anna is terrified that if Betty rejects her, all of the larger group of friends and Betty will no longer be friends with her, despite the fact that Betty loves being her friend. Anna also believes that because Betty is so confident about her sexuality, she who is very unsure of hers is somehow unworthy of her.

I am not sure how to tell my sister I will take Lisa but not Eva. Lisa wants to stay because she is in a really good school and is very college oriented. She is in one after school activity, where she can get a ride home from, and wants to continue next year. She wouldn't be a huge change to my life, as she is with us a lot of the time already.

Eva on the other hand, is not welcome. How do I phrase this in a way that is not accusatory of my sister? 

I would like constructive advice on how to do this. Thank you for your time.



   
**tl;dr**: My sister wants me to watch her two daughters. I would be happy watching one, but not the other, due to criminal and personality issues. How do I phrase this nicely to my sister? ",Me [34F] with my sister [40F] [my whole life...] My sister is moving out of state temp for work wants me to keep her kids for the next 1.5 years so they can finish out the next school year.

28691,Non-Romantic,3gvtpw,"For a little background on our family (relevant to the story, I promise), my parents were married until I was 2, I was the only child until I was 6, then my dad had a one night stand and got twin boys out of it. A few years later he got remarried and had another girl. My dad took several years to truly accept that my brothers were his children. And he obviously resented them because their mother was a real piece of work. 

He was mildly physically abusive to my brothers and I (think NCIS Gibbs head smack kind of thing) until I stood up to him when I was 13. He was being especially bad to my brothers for not cleaning their room. He was screaming at them and repeatedly smacking the back of their heads and they were sobbing and I couldn't let that continue. After I told him that he was out of control and he needed to stop, he never hit us again. He still yelled, a lot. But never hit us. 

Later that year, we moved to a new house and I continued to be pretty protective over my brothers. By then my sister was about 3 or 4 and she was the perfect little angel. She could do no wrong. Even when she did, it was somehow mine, or my brother's fault. 
Minor things happened, like yelling when one of us didn't clean our room or do our chores or anything like that. Then there was one night during dinner, I got up to get a second helping of corn on the cob and my dad told me to sit back down and said With kankles like that, you don't need a second helping of anything. I was 13 and weighed maybe 110lbs. I was FAR from overweight. My stepmom yelled at him for speaking to me that way and I just hid in my room for the rest of the night. There was also some comment about my acne, but its been so long that I don't remember specifically. But I was still a daddy's girl and would do anything for his approval. 

After those comments, I started to get depressed and really anxious when I had to go to his house for the weekend. I would cry every time he picked me up and I counted the hours until I could go back to my mom's. 

The yelling continued occasionally for the next couple years, but when I turned 16 and got my own car, I was in control of when I went to see him. I considered my self a daddy's girl again at this point and I loved going to see him, until I was there. I would spend the night at his house and I would leave immediately after breakfast the next day. 

My dad had issues with infidelity apparently, and my stepmom left him when I was 17.

Then I got pregnant at 18 and my mom kicked me out. I was lucky that my dad immediately offered to take in my boyfriend and I. I did all of the chores and housework because he wasn't charging us rent, but I still couldn't seem to do anything right. My dad started to get angry with my boyfriend because he would play an hour of video games after coming home from work. And after I had my son (who was nearly 10lbs) my dad went back to making subtle comments about my weight and appearance. Things were tense, to say the least. 

My boyfriend and I lived with him for a year before we bought our own place this past March. Now my dad will call me to come work for him, or mow his lawn or just so he can see my son. But he never seems happy to see me, and he criticizes everything that I do when I go over there. 

Then today, I went over to get my birth certificate and he handed me a large envelope of my baby pictures. After coming back home and looking through them, I realized those were the only baby pictures he ever had of me. They were never displayed, not even in a box with my brother's stack of baby pictures and my sister's HUNDREDS of baby pictures. He has 3 picture of me displayed in his house, and at least 10 of each of my other siblings. The pictures he handed me had never left that envelope. 

I've kind of reached the end of my rope here. I've tried for years to get him to appreciate me. But it seems like the only thing I did right was have a cute baby. Now he's moving to Colorado and he doesn't seem to care about any of his children's opinion on it. I'm thinking that when he leaves, I'm just going to cut off all contact. I don't think I can handle this situation anymore. 

TL;DR: my dad's been an ass since I was about 12-13 and after years of verbal and some physical abuse, I'm thinking of completely cutting off contact.","I (19F) am having a hard time deciding how to handle my dads (46M) treatment of me.

28694,Non-Romantic,3d33v4,"Sorry for the length; I promise a good tldr at the end. I feel like the background is important to contextualize the issue, though.

So...family is *the* most important thing to my mother. I know that sounds like something most people would say, but seriously, the only people she really seems to love (or even like) are family members - by blood and by marriage - and she'll do quite literally anything for them. This actually leads to her generosity being taken advantage of a lot, but that's a whole nother post in and of itself. 

Suffice it to say that she was the oldest child in a family of borderline-neglected kids, so she's used to 100% being the leader in good times and bad. She's probably the most stubborn person I've met in my life, which is how she's gotten through a lot of tough things, but also meant that she and I had a terrible relationship when I was a kid because she was so controlling and allowed me zero privacy. 

Things have improved a lot since, to the point where we now have a fairly normal mother-daughter relationship. I'm really the only person in the family who tries to look out for her a bit, instead of just asking her for things all the time.

Here's the thing, though. If you tell my mom something, there's a 90% chance the whole family will know about it by the end of the week. Even if you ask her to keep it to herself, she either cannot or will not. 

And she always has what she considers a great reason for having told people, too - usually some variation of for your own good or so you can get support - except that her kind of 'support' usually comes off as super rude and patronizing (and again, she refuses to believe it). And when I ask her to *please* not tell anyone about something - and cite previous times when she's blabbed - she always pitches a fit and says something to the effect of, FINE, I'LL NEVER TELL ANYONE A SINGLE THING YOU SAY EVER AGAIN! (yeah, right).

Anyway, today was probably the most egregious example of this I've seen. My dad passed away several years ago, but my mom still keeps in touch with some of his family members who live in another country (mainly Natalie, his aunt, and Elly, his cousin). My dad's sister, Mary, also lives in the same country as Natalie and Elly, but had basically cut that whole side of the family out of her life years ago. My mom has heard from Mary probably twice since then, but Mary hasn't spoken to Natalie or Elly since probably 2007.

Well, mom got an email from Elly saying that she'd heard through the grapevine (apparently they go to the same nail salon?) that Mary had recently undergone surgery for breast cancer. None of us had even heard that Mary had been diagnosed, so this was a total shock. When she told me about this, my mom also mentioned that she'd immediately emailed Mary to ask if there was anything she should do.

On the one hand, I think it's wonderful of my mother to reach out to Mary even though Mary has made no effort to keep in contact with us. On the other hand, she didn't even consider how her doing this would affect Elly (who Mary hates for some unknown reason), or Mary (who obviously wanted some privacy with this). When I asked her if she'd cleared contacting Mary with Elly first, my mom was angry because, Of course not! Mary obviously needs help, why wouldn't I contact her immediately?! I tried to point out that people don't usually cut out their entire family for no reason, and that it wasn't our business because we're an ocean away and distant relatives besides, but she wouldn't hear any of it.

In the end, I gave up after she insisted she was right and that I was too introverted and would understand when I'm older. I guess it made me realize that, if I were facing some kind of health issue I didn't want the whole family to know about, I would genuinely just have to not tell my own mother. Which is kind of a frightening thought.

Guys, I'm not sure what to do about this. Especially because I'm not totally sure that I'm in the right here; maybe I *am* being crazy about this. I dunno. Any/all perspective would be great here.

28696,Non-Romantic,3bwxkb,"I've been thinking about this fairly regularly for the last year or so but yesterday, another friend asked me to be her newborn's godmother (so I now have two godchildren - yay!) and it's really hit home. 

My best friend Kate and I have been friends since we were 11. In 2011 she had a son and immediately named me as godmother. I didn't take the decision lightly when I agreed. Neither of us are particularly religious but we're both Catholic and if she'd wanted to baptise him, I'd have been there. This isn't about that though. My understanding of the godparent role, religious or not, is to be a friend to that child, someone they know and can enjoy time with. On a deeper level, if the child ever needed me for anything, I feel I should be there for him and that's what I envisaged when I said yes. That leads me on to my next point. 

More or less concurrently, she was having a lot of issues with her partner John. To summarise, he was an arse in a variety of ways. They'd not been together for long at that point and things were going from bad to worse. It was hard for all the people who cared about her seeing her go back to him each and every time. I admit though, it got even harder being part of their drama. Kate and I worked together for a while and sometimes, things would get so bad she'd be crying in the office. It didn't help that John also worked in our building for a while and some of their problems stemmed from that. Their relationship was so painfully public. She'd tell everyone she was leaving him because of x wrongdoing, then a couple of months later be sneaking around with him. Eventually, she'd try to break it to her family and friends gently, then we'd feel bad about trying to avoid him because of the obvious pressure it was putting Kate under. 

One day, I had to tell her she had a choice. If she really wanted her relationship to work, she needed to stop telling all in sundry when things went bad between the two of them and just work it out as a couple - 99% of people in our office were only after some gossip and didn't give a shit about her. I also said that while I understood why she didn't get why nobody liked him, she'd only ever told us the bad stuff about him, and never the good. I know she can be quite reactionary and that this no doubt contributed to their confrontations, so i told her the next time she rings any of her loved ones out of the blue to help her deal with drama, make sure it actually is real drama and not just a heated row between the two of them. We talked about a whole load of other stuff as well but the gist of it was me just being frank with her and telling her to grow up. 

Now, here's the thing. Their relationship was so up and down that a) I grew to despise John and b) I saw a lot of their son without having to deal with John. John annoyed me anyway but I'd probably have found a way around it if it hadn't been for the endless onslaught of problems and tears from Kate. Nobody liked him, not her parents, her brother and his wife, her other friends. We all tried to avoid him. John obviously knows this, partly because during rows Kate would rub that fact in his face. However, since my frank talk with her, they actually did make a genuine effort. From the sounds of things he's stepped up in both their relationship and parenting his son. 

It was easier for her parents to give him a second chance because Kate and her boy live with them so John is around them all the time. However, because Kate's last knowledge was that I hated John, I think she's trying to avoid things being awkward. We see each other from time to time and speak a lot still, but she and John are also the type of couple that spend almost all day every day with each other. As a result, my fledgling relationship with their son has suffered. I've seen him once this year. I don't hate John, I don't have much feelings about him either way now particularly as I've not seen Kate miserable because of him. It's quite a strange statement to make though hey Kate, guess what, I don't hate your man any more! *thumbs up* so I guess she still has no idea. 

I see my godson a couple of days after Christmas and around his birthday in July. This year we also went to a farm randomly, which was my idea and was really nice. I don't want to be *that* type of godparent, I want to do more but I have no idea how to get through the awkwardness of the dynamic with John and putting Kate's mind at ease.

28700,Non-Romantic,2yracp,"I am fortunate to have an awesome grandma with a heart of gold. She has always loved helping others. However as she has gotten older, she hasn't been able to do as much as she would like (physically and financially) so she has started passing things onto others, including me.

When she comes to an opportunity to help someone and it's something I could do, she tends to volunteer me for it without talking to me first. 

For one example, I recently got a new (to me) car because my old one was in rough shape.  I had someone who wanted to buy the old one for $1000.  But grandma knew a family whose car broke down and they had no way to get to work / get their kids to school, so she told them they could probably have my car, knowing I got a new one and my old one wasn't worth much - but she didn't tell me first.  That put me in a tough position as I was counting on the $1000 as part of budgeting to get a new car, but now I had a father leaving me a voicemail telling me I'm a gift from God and now that he knows he has a way to get to work, he doesn't have to be afraid of whether he can put food on the table.  I ended up giving them the car and made it work financially but she should have asked me first.

For another example she has some friends who needed help moving and she volunteered me to help because I am physically fit, I just got a truck and they're only half an hour away. The thing is she is two hours from me, so they are 2.5 hours away, and they are moving an hour and think it will take 4 trips. So it would cost me about $150 in gas for the weekend which I cannot afford right now.  

When I told my grandma that she became upset because she knows I am also going on a trip with my girlfriend in a month (which we have been saving for, for a year and a half).  She basically said So you can afford to go to the beach with your girlfriend but you can't afford a family in need?

This kind of thing puts me in a tough position.  I realistically know that I need to grow a backbone and set boundaries when it comes to volunteering me for stuff, but that's easier said than done because she is now telling me how disappointed she is in me, she thought I was raised better than this, it's disgusting that I would choose not to help people simply because it's inconvenient for me, etc.  Some family members threw a little celebration for her last week (she won a volunteering award) and she asked me not to come because she wants the day to be positive and she's too disappointed in me right now.

28716,Non-Romantic,2xi3ow,"TL:DR - My religious coworker is removing all materials related to helping LGBT teens from our shared office space in a high school. What should I do?

---------

Thowaway for obvious reasons. Details changed here and there but nothing incredibly relevant.

About me - I do not want to give many specifics because I want to keep my job. I have been in my current role as a clinician in a high school for the past 5 years, have worked with teens in one way or another since graduating university.

I have a small office in our public school of about 1000 students. There is shared office space (I guess you could call it a waiting room) where we leave out resources for students - pamphlets and the like. One other counseling office opens onto this waiting room, and this other office is where my [40f] colleague works. About a month ago I attended a seminar on helping LGBT students and came away with a small stack of resources. Things like pamphlets on defining terms, what to do when you think you might be gay/bi/trans, etc. I read through them and there's nothing especially explicit in them, no descriptions of sex acts or anything like that (although it does discuss safe sex practices). 

Now, the community our school is in is known to be pretty conservative and religious. I have nothing against religion myself, several friends of mine go to church, I'm not an atheist but also not very religious myself. But over the years I've had a couple of students come out of the closet to me, which I can tell is not easy for them in this community. I have been honored by their trust and impressed by their bravery, and often wished I could do more to help them out. These resources were something I was very excited about, and I got enough (for free at the seminar) that I hoped they were going to last me a couple years. I displayed them next to the pamphlets on depression/anxiety/etc - this wasn't something that anybody walking through the school could find, but if you came into our area and started browsing you'd definitely see it. The idea is that any student would be able to come by and grab one when one or both guidance counselors were busy or away - it could be very confidential. For an LGBT student in a community like ours that could be essential.

Enter my colleague - Bess. She is nice enough, has been working at the school about 7 or 8 years longer than I have. We've never clashed before. I know the students like talking to her, though I've heard through the grapevine that she is a strong proponent of abstinence only sex-ed and has actively discouraged students from sexual activity or from investigating birth control options. One or two kids have chosen to come to me for assistance after speaking to her. But I don't want to make it sound like she is incompetent at her job - I've seen her help a lot of kids who were dealing with depression or anxiety, and she has a way with kids who have been abused that is really gentle and supportive. I feel like I've learned a lot from her, to be honest; there have been situations where we were both trying to help a student in a complicated situation and I have been very impressed by her work. That being said she does often speak to me (during breaks or in casual conversation) about her involvement in her church or various religions organizations. Once in a while she has recommended books to me on Christian counseling, but I have always (graciously I hope) turned them down.

When I was putting out the materials Bess was walking through the office and stopped to see what I'd brought back. She was noticeably perturbed by the subject matter and kept asking questions like, But what perspective is it from? Are they supportive of those lifestyle choices? Are they appropriate for impressionable teens? She never came right out and said it but it was obvious that she was uncomfortable.

I noticed after a couple weeks that there were less pamphlets than before. At first I was pretty pumped - hey, kids taking them mean that kids are reading them, right? - but when 3 weeks went by and over half the pamphlets were gone I was getting suspicious. As of yesterday some of them are completely out  and others have only one or two left. I had serious doubts that they were all being taken by students, but tried to give Bess the benefit of the doubt.

Friday morning I was using our shredder and noticed the wastebasket beneath needed to be emptied. When I pulled it out my heart sank - while there was a lot of normal paper in there, some of it was definitely the pamphlets. Bess has been shredding them, probably ever since I brought them in.

What do I do, Reddit? Our direct supervisor is a pretty fair guy but, like most staff at our school, is a religious man and very active in the local church. I also don't know if I should start by going over her head - she is otherwise a very professional woman and I don't know if this is something that I need to bring up with the supervisor yet. I think most staff in the building would object to the materials for religious or political reasons, but it isn't against policy for them to be here. I could just move the materials into my office and make them available on request, but that eliminates the possibility of teens picking them up confidentially.

If I do talk to her about it, how should I bring it up? I respect her right to disagree on these issues but don't think she is acting appropriately.

**Edit:** Wow, did not expect this to blow up. Thanks everyone for weighing in! I am spending the afternoon with my partner so I don't have time to reply individually, but I will read all the comments.

The prevailing attitude seems to be speak to my coworker before going over her head. There's also been some suggestions of websites and other strategies (including the rainbow safe space sticker) that I will use.

More pamphlets and materials are on the way. My plan is to approach Bess early this week and discuss what I found in the shredder, let her know I'll be keeping the stock of the pamphlets up, and see how the conversation goes.

If the conversation goes poorly (i.e. she denies it or won't commit to stopping) then I'll go to the supervisor. I'll draft an email to the supervisor but won't send it until after I speak to Bess, that way it will come from me first to the supervisor and not from Bess.

I'm very sad, I've always had a good working relationship with this woman. But I think you folks are right - the LGBT teens and the issues they are going through are more important, and someone needs to speak on their behalf.

This may get lengthy: 
We've been friends for about 8 years. She's the only best friend I've ever had, and being an only child, she's like the sister I never had. 

We were close in high school and now college. However, she's grown increasingly distant this past year. She started hanging out with some of our classmates (all guys) more often, and I came when I could, which wasn't often because I work at night, which is when they generally hang out. Also, I didn't much care for this group because I was often referred to as the slut of the group because I'm the only one who has had sex with more than one other person. I didn't like the whore jokes, which I definitely understood as jokes, they just went too far sometimes. 

At one point, I asked my best friend for her help in getting them to lay off a little bit while I was around. She definitely had my back for about a month, then she was the one making the jokes again. I had no idea until a few of the guys pointed it out to me. I confronted her, and she kind of said she was sorry. The jokes became less frequent, but I also started hanging out with my boyfriend and his friends more often instead. 

Fast forward a few months, and she and I have an apartment with another girl. The guys are always over, hanging out, and I try to join into the group. One of the guys (Guy 1) develops a crush on me, and of course it's the person my best friend has a thing for. So I started backing off and staying with my boyfriend more often. I thought that maybe if I wasn't around so much, he would just lose interest.

I came home one night to an empty apartment, went to bed, and woke up a few hours later to my best friend and roommate stumbling in. They proceeded to talk, rather loudly, about how Guy 1 only likes me because I'm skinny and pretty. On and on about how he would prefer her if she was thinner. All of this wouldn't bother me so much if this was the only time she's mentioned how he only likes me for the way I look, that anyone ever likes me just because of the way I look. 

I've talked to her about it, We do talk about a lot of stuff too, Why would you want a guy that likes you only for your looks anyway?, Why does it matter?, but she always sticks to her guns. Also, because I've been trying to back out of that situation and have been spending more time with my SO, she and I haven't been hanging out much. And when we do, I often feel like I have to force the conversation. 

I plan on going to grad school this upcoming May. Years ago, we planned to go together; I would go to school, and she would find a job in that city. She often referred to us as a package deal. Within the past three months, she has decided to stay here, get a job, and be roommates with two of the guys (and one of their girlfriends) instead. Granted, she does have a large family that it would be difficult to move away from. I completely understand. But she never talked to me about it, just told me one day that she'd changed her mind. 

I'm at the point where I don't know if trying to make this friendship work is reasonable. Without her, and the guys, I have my boyfriend and his friends. But I still feel very alone and confused as to how to handle this.

I met her (lets call her Emma) in middle school and we became best friends freshmen year. We were super close freshmen and sophomore year, never had any fights, talked on the phone constantly, and hang out like all the time. I'm a very shy and calm person. Emma is loud and outgoing. We're both very opposite people to begin with.

Emma hit a few bumps sophomore year when she started hanging out with an older crowd who drank and smoke. She fell into those habits and got drunk a lot. I don't mind people who smoke/drink, but personally I'm not into that kind of stuff. Our only problem that we had this year was that she didn't talk to me much at school. She was super into her older friends with cars. Her neglecting our friendship at school is how I met my boyfriend. Junior year she got really weird. She complained that school wasn't as fun without her older friends who graduated which made me and my boyfriend (let's call him Jason) feel like we weren't good enough for her. Suddenly, our friendship began to feel on the edge. I feel like I'm walking on thin ice and occasionally I'm making it crack.


Emma's always been jealous about my weight and grades. She's also a very negative person. When Jason and I started dating she became jealous of that too. She saw how good our relationship was (for a high school relationship that is) and how long it's lasted. She dates a guy for maybe a few days and then it's done. This summer I have spent a lot of time with Jason (he had a tragic life changing event and he still struggles with it so I try to focus on him). She complains I never invite her to do anything but she never asks me to do anything either. One point in the school year we had gotten into a fight. She said we were drifting and I didn't need her anymore, that I only needed Jason. It was such a random fight that came out of no where. It sounds weird, but honestly Jason and I don't act like a couple at school, especially when friends are around. We think it's rude to be all over each other so we only hug/kiss when friends aren't around and hold hands occasionally.


I give Emma and Jason the same attention that I have since I met them. I try to balance out being with them. I've only spent so much more time with Jason this summer because of what happened. Besides she's always hanging out with her other friends everyday so I didn't think it was that much of an issue.


Lately though, it feels like nothing I say is what she wants to hear. I give her advice about something and she brushes it off, but someone else gives her the same advice and she takes it. One day when we were hanging out at her house she was talking about her boyfriend (we think he might be cheating). I told her how I saw the relationship and maybe it'd be best if she dated another guy who's really interested in her. Her response was Maybe. I want to see what -her friend- says about all of this before I actually make a decision. That really hurt. Anything I say seems to make her mad. Whenever I vent to my mom about it, I always start off with Emma's mad at me again to which my mom replies sarcastically What else is new?


Emma is constantly trying to guilt trip me about things as well. Jason and my therapist have told me she knows how manipulate me. She doesn't listen to me when I talk either. When we're together she's always staring at her phone. I'll say something and a minute later she'll let out the most fake sounding laugh and say yeah.

Her only focus in life is boys. I understand she's a teen girl and obviously she's going to be into boys, but they're seriously her only focus. The only conversation she knows how to make is about all the boys that text her, want to date/sleep with her, want to hang out, etc. Drinking and boys are the only things she's interested in. She's very sexual too and will give in to any guy. Whenever anyone in our group of friends hangs out with her they always say She only talks about boys and drinking which always makes everyone reply with Typical Emma or Emma's an Emma


Emma and I haven't been getting along right now and actually haven't talked to each other in a few days. Senior year is starting in a few weeks and I'm sick to my stomach about what to do. We signed up to share a locker so I almost feel stuck with her. We don't have any classes together though.


I honestly feel like I could make it through this school year without her. I'd probably feel happier. My friend told me that it's time to stand on my own two feet and fight back. He also said that I should focus more on me, whether that's school or work or Jason, and that whoever wants to join me will and if Emma doesn't want to then so be it. I've been daydreaming of telling her that I'm tired of these childish games if we were to fight again. My old best friend (who is similar to my personality) from freshmen year has been talking to me a lot more. I'm hoping my friendship with her builds up and we can make the school year a good year.


I can't wait to go to college and leave this friendship behind. I feel like she drags me down. What should I do? My plan now is to just go along with the friendship until school ends or until she lets go first. I know this seems like such silly high school drama but it's leaving weight on my shoulders and I don't know what to do.


Has anyone else gone through this? Can anyone offer an advice on how to get through this year?


I'm sorry this is so long:/ I just wanted to make sure everyone knew the background information. Feel free to ask questions if you need anymore clarification.


TL;DR: My best friend has become very distant towards me lately. She feels I spend too much time with my boyfriend (who is dealing with a very troubling issue and needs me right now).

The problem relates to my mother and her weight gain over the last year or so. It started sometime last spring/summer a few months after she had started dating her current boyfriend, Mike. Prior to that point, she was in decent shape. My mom was always a bit overweight during my childhood and teenage years, but after my parents split up, which was about two and a half years ago, she started taking better care of herself. We became running/diet partners, and she eventually reached the 130s, although her weight still fluctuated some.   

Sometime around late January of last year she met Mike. He seemed like a nice enough guy when I met him, and they soon became serious. I think it is important to note that Mike is the first serious relationship my mom has had since she split with my dad. In any event, things were fine heading into the summer of last year. Then sometime around my high school graduation in June she told me that she needed to have an important conversation with me. When we talked, she told me that she was going to be seriously cutting back on our runs. She said that it was because she wanted to put on some weight and become curvier again. Mike had told her that he preferred women who were more curvy, and she wanted to please him. She also said that she wanted to relax for a little while and not worry so much about her weight.

I didn’t really think that much about it at the time. I assumed that my mom knew what she was doing, so I just left it at that and didn’t really try to discourage her. She seemed content with her decision, and I was happy to see her relationship with Mike going so well. After our conversation, my mom cut her runs with me from 4-5 days a week to just 1-2 days a week, and she started walking instead of running or jogging. She also stopped being so strict with her diet. She had cut out things like sodas and junk food in order to lose weight, but she started eating and drinking them again. As you can guess, she started to put on some of the weight she had lost. By the time I went to college last fall, she had probably put on about about 15-20 pounds, which put her back around what she weighed when she was still with my dad. I  wasn’t that worried, though. My mom carried the weight well and seemed happy with her decision and her relationship with Mike.

I didn’t see or speak to my mom that much for the next month or so until I came home for fall break. That was the first time I had seen her since move in weekend, and she had put on even more weight. I didn’t ask her how much (didn’t really think it was any of my business at that point), but I thought it would be okay if I tried to subtly encourage her to be a little healthier, especially since she had stopped exercising altogether by this point. I tried to get her to go on a run with me over break, but she would just give me an excuse each time (e.g. too cold, too tired, etc.) or Mike would discourage her. I also couldn’t help but notice that her diet had become even worse. It seemed like almost everything she ate now was fast food or some kind of junk food. I suspected that this was mostly Mike’s doing since he was always bringing home unhealthy food and avoiding things like fruits and vegetables. Still, I didn’t really feel like it was my place to say anything yet, so I left it be. I did ask her if things with Mike were okay or if something was bothering her. She said that everything was fine, so I just said okay.

I went back to school and didn’t come back home again until Thanksgiving break, but it was more of the same--my mom had gained more weight. I am not sure exactly what she weighed at this point, but I know she was larger.  I hadn’t planned to say anything, but I got worried after watching her eat over break. Even though I knew it was normal for people to indulge over Thanksgiving, it seemed like she was always eating. I would see Mike constantly bringing her snacks or something and mom would eat it. Even if she said she was full or not hungry, he would make a big fuss until she gave in and ate whatever it was he brought her. I made a point to speak to my mom and told her that I noticed she had still been gaining weight and it was starting to worry me. I told my mom that if she continued to gain weight it would have a negative impact on her health. She told me that she had just been enjoying herself and the freedom of not having to worry about her weight and what she was eating. She said that Mike told her that he didn’t care if she gained more weight after the first 20 pounds and had actually encouraged her to get bigger and curvier. I asked her why she had decided to stop caring about herself and her weight, and my mom told me that Mike had helped her see that she was always meant to be an overweight woman. She now believed that she looked better if she was larger and said that she planned to gain some more weight. I asked her when she planned to stop, and she said when she got to around 200 pounds. I sort of lost it there. I told her that she was eating herself to death and that she needed to eat healthier, be more active, and lose some weight. We had a huge fight, and I wound up leaving early to go back to school. 

After the Thanksgiving incident, she messaged me and told me that she was an adult and would not be lectured to or controlled by her child. My mom also told me that if I wanted to live in her house I needed to respect her choices and not interfere with them or her relationship with Mike. I also got an email from Mike. It said basically the same thing--respect my relationship with your mother and her choices or don’t come home. (He had moved into my mom’s house by this point.) I decided to spend X-mas and New Year’s with my dad and his family, and I didn’t come home during the spring semester.

I just recently finished school and moved back into my mom’s house for the summer. I had kept up with her through Facebook and knew she had still been gaining weight, but I didn’t realize how big she had gotten until I got home. I would guess she is somewhere around, if not over, 200 pounds now. Everything about her is bigger; she doesn’t even look like my mom anymore because of how much weight she has gained in her face. She is mostly sedentary now other than what she does at her office during the day. After she gets home she sits on the couch and gorges herself. I am shocked at how much she eats now. Mike is always bringing her food and encouraging her to eat, and she is happy to stuff herself each night until she has a belly ache. My mom will also wake up each night and go into the kitchen to fix herself a “snack,” which is really just another large meal. They don’t even hide the fact that my mom is actively trying to get fatter! Mike has encouraged my mom to buy larger sizes of clothing for my mom so that she has “room to grow,” and she agreed. I have also heard Mike and my mom talk about her trading in her car to get something that will be more comfortable for her as she gets bigger. It is crazy! 

I know this is what they both want, but the extra weight is starting to impact her health. She gets out of breath very easily now and complains if she has to do a moderate amount of physical activity (e.g. walk a long distance from a parking lot to a store, etc.). She also has developed minor knee and back problems and is always tired, and I know that this will only get worse if she continues to gain weight. However, she blames these problems on age and on her asthma rather than her weight. It is breaking my heart to see her doing this to herself. I am so afraid that she is going to die young and leave me without my mother if she continues down this path. I tried bringing up the subject again the other night even though I knew that Mike and my mom would get upset. I asked her at dinner if we could maybe try to eat less fast food and junk food and if she could stop trying to actively gain weight, and she got mad. She told me that I was a vain person, and that not everyone wanted to be a shapeless rail--some women want to have curves. After that, Mike came into my room and told me that if I said anything else, my mom had agreed with him that I would have to find another place to live for the summer. He also told me that I just needed to accept that my mom is a larger woman and that she will be getting larger. I asked him what he meant and mentioned that she said she would stop at around 200, and he told me that they both had decided that she should keep gaining past that. I got angry with him, but was afraid to say more. I don’t doubt that he would kick me out of my mom’s house, and I am not sure if my mom would try to stop him.

I tried contacting my sister about this, but seeing as she lives in another state and doesn’t get along with our mom, she didn’t really have anything to say. My dad doesn’t want to get involved either, since he has a fiancee and his own life. I would speak to some of my mom’s friends, but I don’t know if that would work. She hasn’t had much to do with them since she started dating Mike, so I don’t know if they would feel comfortable intervening. There isn’t any other close family members on my mom’s side that I could talk to. I really would appreciate any help or advice! I want to say something again, but I know how that will end. I guess I am wondering if it is better to take a (final?) desperate stand or bite my tongue and try to help my mom in a more subtle way. Or should I just accept that my mom is an adult and has to make her own choices and mistakes?

tl;dr: My mom started dating a man named Mike. He likes curvy women and has convinced her to gain weight for him. However, now the weight gain has started to affect my mom’s health and my relationship with her because I am trying to make her live a healthier lifestyle. I have been told that I will be kicked out of my mom’s house if I keep bringing up the subject. What should I do?

So I've been this guys friend for quite a while now, we've always got on well and we've always been on good terms. I needed a place to stay whilst I was going to college so I moved in with him a few years ago and he's a great guy to live with in the sense that he does his share of the house work and doesn't cause any problems. However, he is quite introverted (which is fine, I am too) and doesn't really have many friends that he hangs out with regularly aside from me and a couple of other people. I think it's probably because his self-confidence isn't the best and he probably has a fear of being rejected by new people.

Whenever we hang out, it's quite clear that silence is uncomfortable for him, and he always has to say something to fill the gaps even if what he says is totally irrelevant and contributes nothing to conversation. When he says these things and there is no response because no one is sure how to respond, he becomes aware of that and it just becomes awkward. I think for a group to function well you can't let every silence bother you, a silence only becomes an awkward silence if you make it that way, and its something he does regularly. The other thing that is starting to grate on me is that I feel like he isn't motivated to meet new people, it's like he finds it easier that I make friends and bring them to him. This is fine to an extent but I'm really starting to feel like I'm having to tailor my social life in such a way that fits around him as well me.

These are just a few of the things that bother me and I can clarify any queries and go in to more detail in the comments. He really is a nice guy, and I feel so guilty for resenting him a lot of the time for these reasons. But I feel so drained because it is a difficult situation to try and remedy. The thing is all he really needs is a little more self confidence and a lot of this would go away, but I have no idea how to give him the confidence boost he needs.

28781,Non-Romantic,2r9oad,"One of my roommates has been my best friend throughout college, and though we've gotten through strains in our friendship before, I feel like it's dwindling out and now it just feels awkward to be around her, and I have no idea how do deal with it.

About a year ago, we decided we would move in together, and officially started living together in September with two other girls. The two other girls and I bonded pretty well pretty fast, but my friend (I'll call her L) was always so busy with her new boyfriend and work that she was hardly around. We could tell that L kind of resented that me and roommates always were able to spend time together, but at the same time, L could have made a little more effort, maybe sparing one of the 4 days out of the week that she spends with her SO to spend time with us (or just me).

I feel a little resentment towards L too. I get that in a new relationship you want to spend a lot of time with your SO (and he's a great person), but I feel left in the dust now. Before we moved in together and before this relationship, L and I had all these fun plans, but we haven't spent any time together since moving in, and she is almost never without her SO.

She also just became sour-- she talks down to me and others a lot and in general has a bad attitude, and so I decided to separate myself from her because I have a ton of other stuff going on in my life and I didn't want to deal with her negative energy.

I'm fine with this friendship ending, I've been expecting it and tbh she can be pretty toxic. However, it just feels awkward to be around her and we tend to avoid each other, avoiding the negative energy that's still between us. How can I still live comfortably and also avoid any uncomfortable confrontation?

Person #2 is a higher up [45/m] who used to work on my floor. Used to be very friendly and we had great rapport. I'm not sure what caused it to break down. I asked him about it once and he brushed it off. A short while after that he moved to a different building. Sometimes we pass by each other in the cafeteria but he ignores me. Even the couple of times he turned out to be standing behind me in line he's ignored me. One time I was in line with a couple of my co-workers and he comes up, taps one of them on the shoulder and makes a big deal, saying hi to both of them, haven't seen you girls since I moved, etc. but doesn't even say Hello to me. I don't know if they said anything to him, but they brought it up when we sat down to eat and talked on for a while about how he was so rude. That was maybe three months ago? Anyways on Facebook he shows up on my suggested friends list but I've never added him though some of my co-workers have. I felt like it would be random and kind of unprofessional to do so, especially since we no longer seemed to be on good terms. Yesterday one of his posts showed up on my feed because a co-worker commented on it and I click through to his profile because I was bored and curious and guess what? Another broken thumbs up page.





If it was just one ex from years ago I wouldn't care. Blocking me seems kind of extreme but whatever, we used to date so it's not totally weird. People probably block their exes all the time. But this dude from work too?





It bugs me because when I block people it's only because they really creep me out. For example they won't stop sending me messages or we have mutual friends so my privacy settings mean they can see what I post even though we aren't friends. The last dude I blocked was a guy I met at a party who kept sending me descriptions of the dreams he had about me. I thought that's what most people use the block feature for? I doubt I show up on their feed that often if we aren't friends since I don't post stuff, just like things people invite me to like or accept event invitations. So now I'm wondering if I'm a social pariah or have autism or something and just don't know it.






I don't have any close friends, partly because of life circumstances having to take care of aging parents and druggie brother, partly because I used to have really serious PTSD, partly because I got pregnant at a young age. Most of my socializing is done through work events, or volunteering or if someone from my old church tries to bring me back in the fold and invites me to some function. I made some friends in high school and around the neighborhood but I either fell out of touch with them or did something to mess it up. I got my shit together and moved out here to help my younger sister go to school five years ago and I've been a different person ever since, but ironically its now even harder to make friends. People are friendly to me at work and will sometimes ask me out or something but it usually happens a couple of times and then I invite them somewhere and its a I have plans with no offer to reschedule. Any time I've tried to bring it up I'm made to feel like I'm being needy, delusional, or worse. It bothered me a few years back that I hadn't made friends, especially because I had no one to share birthdays or even weekends with, but now that all three of my kids are in grade school i don't have the energy to party even if I wanted.






Nevertheless, I can't help but wonder if there's something wrong with me and wish I could fix it. I know it seems like I'm blowing this out of proportion but I'm reflecting on a lot of little things like this that when added up are kind of upsetting. The cashiers at the local Trader Joe's say hello and make small talk to every customer in line but me. I've been going to this store for the last five years but have yet to make small talk with a single cashier. I've been working at this place for about that long and a lot of my co-workers have functions to which I'm never invited. I've tried a few times to invite people over and they give me the run around a couple times until I get the hint and we keep it cordial, polite and work-related. I told a couple co-workers about how I felt like I still hadn't fell in with everyone at work and they said to make a facebook, thats how everyone communicates these days, no one invites people to things in person. So I took a leap and made one and...well. The connections I've had that have felt supportive are with guys crushin on me, and these never develop into something more than friends once they find out I have kids.






I think I'm fairly average looking, maybe dress a little different from people around here because I'm originally from LA but I try to keep it simple so as not to stand out too much, I don't think I smell. I don't smoke. I'm a good mom. I'm not great at small talk but its only because its hard for me to relax. I took Xanax for a week and connecting to people was easy...anyways. I lurk this forum from time to time when I have nothing to read before bed, thought I should put it out there since I keep thinking about it.

28794,Non-Romantic,2piw2b,"I had a mutual and pretty cordial break up with my ex boyfriend (let's call him Jim) of 3 years. We wanted to remain friends but decided to go no contact for a while in order to have time to get over everything. 

2 months later I remembered these music festival tickets I had bought to go with my then boyfriend. Jim had been really looking forward to going, more so than me, and I had scheduling conflicts with work so I wanted to give them to him. Together they're worth about $400 and I couldn't think of anyone else that would enjoy them more. To get around the self imposed no contact I enlisted a mutual friend of ours (aka Bob) to give the tickets to him to do as he pleased.

Today I was shooting the shit with Bob and he mentioned how great this one band's live performance was, and when I asked him where he'd seen them he got this sheepish look on his face and said he saw them at the festival. Ok no problem, I never said Jim couldn't take Bob with him. But when I asked him how Jim had enjoyed the festival he told me he never even went, and Bob brought his own friend with him! After some prodding he told me Jim didn't want to go and gifted him the tickets.

I guess his story's reasonable but I'm still suspicious that Bob never told Jim about the tickets and just went himself without consulting either of us for several reasons:

1. It's weird that Bob never mentioned he went to me, or told me that Jim wasn't going. 

2. I know Jim was incredibly excited for this festival, and I don't feel like he'd be so besotted from our breakup that he wouldn't go. Again, it was a very calm breakup.

3. I'm pretty surprised that Jim would take Bob with him. Yes they're friends, but I would have thought off the bat that Jim would have taken his best friend with him, who loves the same type of music as him.

So what now? Jim and I had estimated about a year for the no contact, and I don't really want to violate that to ask him personally (I felt iffy even sending him the tickets through our friend).

They stack their dirty  dishes up and leave them on the sink. It's making me really annoyed everytime I want to use the kitchen, because I actually do my dishes when I'm done with them and I have to work around their dirty shit. 
I don't consider myself to be a clean freak, but this mess is making me angrier and angrier the more I see it grow. I thought it was just plain good manners to clean up after yourself if you share a kitchen (this is my first time living away from home, so I might be wrong). 

The second night I was here, I actually did all the dirty dishes in the sink, because the mess was annoying me. I hoped that all that dirty  shit wasn't a regular thing. 
Lo and behold, the mess accumulated again, and so I just move their crap out of the sink so I can clean my dishes. 

I know the only other girl in my apartment cleans up after herself. It's the dudes that don't. When I met her, she told me that she's tried to make them clean up after themselves but to no avail, and that she was shocked to find the dishes done after I cleaned them on my second night here. They all seem like introverted people, so I don't see them walking around very much. I just see the mess they leave behind in the kitchen. Thank Jesus there's two bathrooms and they're male/female designated. If they're this gross about their kitchen habits, I don't even want to know about the state of their bathroom.

I don't know how to approach them about this, I've only been here just over a week. Any advice?

28797,Non-Romantic,2u9gf9,"I've worked with this guy for 7 years, he is married with 2 great children.  For the past 2.5 years, he has been having an affair with another co-worker.  I noticed that they were spending an inordinate amount of time together and finally just flat out asked him, and he told me.  This was a little over 18 months ago.

The problem is that ever since he told me, he is using me for all of his emotional outlets because I am (according to him) the only one who knows what is going on.  I have tried to tell him in the past that I can't give him support any longer, and he listens for a couple of days and then start in all over again, even if I keep telling him.

Recently, things have escalated a lot because the other woman is basically telling him it's been 2.5 years and he either needs to get a divorce or let her go.  They have this fight about once a month and each time he's mopey for 2-3 days afterwards, takes a lot of coffee breaks, doesn't really get much work done.  My boss  (also his boss) notices, but just assumes he is in a funk and will snap out of it.

Through all of this, I'm starting to feel really stressed out about this whole thing.  I don't condone in the least what he is doing to his family and I don't agree with anything about his relationship with the other woman - at the same time, he is training me in things that I will need to know for the rest of my life/career, so I have to keep him somewhat close.

The other concern I have is that my boss and other co-workers have started to notice that he is doing less work, seems pouty a lot, etc.  I don't want this all to blow up and they find out I knew and hold it against me.  I like the guy, but I really like my job and don't want to jeopardize it.

My thought is that I should tell my boss what is going on, so I can cover myself in the event that something ends up happening.  I am not sure how he will react but I feel it's the right thing to do given how crazy things are getting.  I also think I need to sit him down and tell him that I don't want to deal with this relationship anymore - the problem is I don't really know how he will react either, and I can't lose him as a technical co-worker because he is teaching me a lot.  What do I do?  Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing?

In November of last year I met my bf and after becoming best friends we started officially dating a little while later. So far we have had a very loving relationship, and are both very happy together.  

At the beginning of the relationship we agreed to keep our relationship down low, we are both pretty private people, and would rather that the details of our relationship were not on display for the whole world to see. This included our parents. His parents do not want him to date until he is at least in grad school, and my parents are very over-protective and refuse to talk to me about boys, sex, relationships, etc. As such, we figured that keeping our relationship private for a while, or at least until he left for college (this August), would be a good idea. 

Things went smoothly for a while, no one knew about our relationship except for my best friend, a mutual very close friend and a few mutual friends.

We were/are both very busy with activities and high school, homework, etc. We made sure to not let dating interfere with school,  (I am homeschooled, he went to a nearby public school and just graduated), grades, my music, and family time.

At first our relationship was just more casual, but it quickly became more serious, we are planning to stay together throughout college, (I will be a senior this year, so we would have at least one year of ldr) I lost my virginity to him (which was totally amazing), we have many talks about the future, and while I realize that there is no guarantee of us being together through college, or even anything, I was excited at the mere prospect of having some sort of future together. 

In the end of May, after getting back from a vacation, I fell asleep at my computer while skyping him. My mom came into my room and saw him on the computer screen, and the facebook message thread. She took the computer, shut off skype, and read several weeks worth of messages detailing everything we had done(i.e. sex), many private conversations, and on and on. 

She then showed everything to my father, and had him read all of the conversation as well. After a 4 hour long lecture, they took my computer, car keys, phone, ipod, the ipod shuffle that I have for running (I run long distance), my dvd player, and locked them all in my mom's closet. They put passwords on their computers and phones, took all the home phones off the wall and locked them away, along with the internet modem thngy. 

I was not allowed to go upstairs during the day, (both of my parents are retired), I could not go into another room on the first floor where they could not see me for longer than 5 minutes. Every day was a constant lecture. I was not allowed to leave the house, except for church. I could not see or talk to any of my friends, even ones who knew nothing about the relationship. 

Highlights of lectures: Why would you have sex? I can't believe this. Don't you know he thinks you're just another cheap piece of ass to lay?

How will any man value you now? You've been ruined!

I'm so sorry for you. Making such a mistake like that, throwing your life away. Losing your virginity before marriage gives you all kinds of mental and physical problems. I can only pray that doesn't happen to you.

He didn't ask our permission to date you. He didn't value you. He never bought you any gifts, or came to pick you up when you went to his house. Can't you see he never loved you?? 

I was told so many times about how my friends would hate me. That I was a slut for sending out pictures to every guy I knew. (Totally untrue, I would never, ever, send nudes to anyone that I was not dating, and I still don't know how they got this impression?) That my friends parents would refuse to let me see them again, and that they would hate me. (My best friends parent's actually think my parents are overreacting and feel bad for me.) My mother told me that my boyfriend was dating someone behind my back, because my bf and I had had a conversation about a mutual friend who my bf had liked before we started dating. My mother told me that my boyfriend was sleeping around, that I was going to get an STD because he was always cheating on me. 

My mother has never spoken with him, and has no validation to any of these claims. He and I discussed in detail the consequences of sex, and were always protected, and had a plan in case protection failed. He was always upfront with me about his sexual history, which wasn't much, just one other girl about a year ago. Everything was consensual, which my mother refuses to believe. He waited to have sex, until I initiated, and he even paid for all the condoms, and plan b once. (Back up just in case.)

My parents are sure that he forced me into sex, into lying to them, and into a relationship.

I got told daily for weeks by my mother about how I would regret it, about how he never loved me, because he didn't introduce himself, and because he never bought me any gifts. I was told how various friends would hate me and refuse to talk to me again, how adults that I look up to and respect would hate me. About how we ruined a music group that we both participated in. (We just met there, we never did anything there, it was just where we first met.) About how I was going to fail in life now, about how I threw my life away, about how I would regret this for the rest of my life, how sorry they were that I had disappointed the family this way, how I was a slut, how I now had STD's, about how I was going to get pregnant, they would force me to have the baby, and I would end up living in a car, begging on the side of the road just to survive, and how I had thrown away all that they had worked for. 

My father didn't say any of this at first, because he refused to talk to me for a week, and then he would say the same things.

They forced me to go to a doctor, and get tested for STD's and pregnancy (negative on both counts, which I knew, but they wouldn't believe me). They took me to an attorney, who told us that I was in no legal trouble and that they were over reacting. They want to start family counseling, and to send me to a therapist and a psychologist.

This was about 9 weeks ago. Except for one time that I saw my best friend, (a supervised visit), to my parent's knowledge, I have seen no one,  or talked to no one besides them, and people at church. 

The only reason I have my computer is because of several summer classes I am taking online from Johns Hopkins.

They told me they don't want to ever give me back my phone, or my car, and they will happily drive me wherever I need to go and wait for me. 

However, I've been lasting through this for almost 3ish months now. I am tired. I stay at home all day, everyday, for weeks. I am losing motivation for life. I no longer want to do anything, and feel unmotivated about everything. My parents are banning me from any future contact with all of my friends but one. 

I don't really care about life anymore. They talk about wanting to have a close, Godly family, but my father ignores me, and they yell at each other and are very petty to one another. My mother keeps talking about how they want to go back to our perfect family, and how she couldn't believe she didn't notice the change in me. 

My family didn't notice that for two years I had an eating disorder and lost about ~18 pounds, or that I cut myself for a year and a half. (13 months clean, and proud!) They didn't notice when I was depressed, or suicidal. Or perhaps they did, and didn't want to say something. I would prefer to believe the former, because thinking that your family didn't care about their child cutting themselves or starving themselves, is a rather depressing thought.

The best part is how my parents have decided that they want to hold me back a year in highschool and not let me go to college. They don't have an academic reason (All A's except one B-, 30+ on ACT, 2200+ on SAT, all 5's on AP, 700+ on SAT II's). They have just told me that they can't trust me on a college campus, and don't want to let me go because I don't have a strong moral basis or belief system to keep you from corruption. I am not okay with this. I will go insane if I have to live with them for another year. I just can't take it.

My question is, I guess, what do I do? I can't live with them any more than just the one year I (thought I had) left until college, I am becoming increasingly more apathetic towards life. I don't want to do anything, nothing excites me anymore, I don't want to do anything, I just don't care. I miss my bf more than I can say, we do still talk, but it's limited. I don't want to practice, I don't want to do homework, I just don't care. I don't think they are going to change, I would almost just rather not exist anymore than have to hear another lecture, or another muttered comment. I can't take much more of this, and any attempt to say something to my mom results in, if you're unhappy, just choose to be happy, happiness is a choice, you got yourself into this, deal with it, you think you're sad? think about the disappointment you caused this family!. And more I just can't bring myself to type. 

I really just don't know what to do in regards to the whole situation, can I just have some advice? Maybe from someone whose parents didn't approve of their SO but who continued to date them regardless, or just advice on how to keep on trying to stay positive, what to do when you can't leave the house for weeks, how to stay positive, how to deal with my parents? Time doesn't seem to help at all. Most of all, what do I do about them trying to hold me back a year in highschool? I can't take that. Also, what do I do if in a couple years if I want to introduce my bf to the family?

28811,Non-Romantic,3i4et2,"**tl;dr: Friend is really negative and uses tactics that I'm uncomfortable with to engage me. I called her out on the behavior and now my other friendships seem to be affected because of it.**

Hi. My friend lets call her Steph has been a really good friend looking back. We hadn't known each other for very long about 2 years but we got close really quickly because we lived right next to each other and also because she'd always tell me about her problems usually about her relationship with her boyfriend and I'd listen occasionally giving advice.

She'd always make me cups of coffee or just generally be really nice getting me presents and I really loved having her around. After a while she broke up with her boyfriend which I'd been telling her to do for a while, he seemed quite arrogant and could be quite mean from what she'd tell me. At this point she met a new guy who I had known for a little while at that point and I was really happy for them.

A few months later I noticed that she'd complain about her new boyfriend lets call him Mike just as much. I knew the guy so I thought that doesn't sound like something he'd do but I'd keep pushing it aside and just saying I'm sure it'll be fine or being shocked that he'd act in a negative way towards her. We'd recently made some new friends as well around where we lived one guy lets call him Jacob was already quite close with Mike and me and him became friends too. 

Around this time she told me she'd been treated by a therapist for anxiety and that she took medication. I told her it was fine. One day out of the blue she sends me a message on facebook asking if I'm free to talk. I was out at the time but I replied asking what was up. She told me she'd been feeling quite down and thinking about killing herself. 

I reacted in the only way I knew how by telling her she'd eventually feel better. I know it seems irrational but for a few months I had that incident hanging over me. Was I a bad friend? Did I react badly? Why do I even feel like this? Since that day and for the last half of our relationship she just kept complaining about everything and everyone. She'd ask people to visit and then complain about how much they didn't care about her or used her. Jacob who befriended her boyfriend would always be made out to be awful. Sometimes she'd say the same thing about Mike like how he doesn't care about her feelings. 

Through all this I kept reassuringly telling her everything would be fine, nodding along at her complaint even though I thought it was mainly her anxiety at this point. After a while I began to realize I hadn't had a positive conversation with her in about 6 months but I kept just putting it down to her anxieties.

I was on vacation with my family and she sent me an email saying I'd forgotten about her and that she'd find somebody else to talk to if I couldn't be there for her. I flipped at that point thinking I've barely spoken to my family for the last 6 month, haven't spoken to my boyfriend in a week (vacation) and she's accusing me of not caring about the friendship when I spent so much time with her. I told her that she could be really emotionally manipulative and that it was hard to deal with and that the way she tries to get attention from people isn't healthy.

I told her that we are different people and I can't be friends with her as it's beginning to be stressful, exhausting detrimental to my mental health (btw i'm on vacation). At that point I'd noticed she'd put up a status on facebook not that long after saying effectively that people didn't understand her illness and that they should try more.

I got really defensive at this point because the timings were too perfect and I'm really private. She said I was imagining things and 'what i'm not allowed to write a status?'. She refused to admit responsibility for anything so I told her i'd rather not be friends. At this point Steph would call me and I'd ignore because i was angry, she tried every trick under the sun to make me engage with her. Talking to me via a group chat about something unrelated, asking Mike to message me and see if I'm okay and then eventually I had enough and asked her not to try and contact me. 

We have a lot of the same friends so I knew I'd have to see her around. I had a party to go to which I knew she'd be at so I thought If I don't go people might assume there's something wrong with me  so I decided why not. I got there and because the things I'd said to her were still fresh and I very much felt still felt hurt I spent the whole evening keeping my distance, talking to people I hadn't spoken to before, enjoying myself and stuff.

We went to get food afterwards and I ordered and sat down. We were with a large group of people so there wasn't enough room for all of us to sit together. So I sat at a different table from the main group with  a few other friends while she sat with Mike and a couple others.

The next day I went home and thought great I can actually spend time with people without having to act like her best friend and she seemed to handle it well. We'd usually been super talkative with each other but I thought if I'm mad it would be disingenuous to act like her best friend and besides I didn't feel like I even wanted to. I was still a little butt hurt about my vacation.

I get a message from Jacob saying Steph been talking about me and thinks I'm out to get her. I asked him honestly whether after the time he's known me he believes that to be true. He said no you wouldn't do that. I leave it alone and continue my summer of peaceful solitude.

About 3 weeks later Mike sends me a message telling me to understand her feeling, that this is difficult for her and that i'm being malicious. In the message he also wrote that something along the lines of if you make this about you and her you won't win. I knew at that moment his conflict of interest meant he couldn't be impartial and I told him not to get involved. Repeatedly. He kept pushing me though and after a while I realized that he was just another way for her to vent her feelings at me. 

He told me I was emotionally distant that that night (the one I thought went well) I had scoffed at her, repeatedly ignored her when she tried to talk to me and that when I sat at the table it was maliciously and in order to hurt her by splitting the group up. I did the same thing as with Jacob because I knew I hadn't spoken to anyone about mine and Steph's disagreement unless they came to me first. I asked Mike if he honestly thought that I was maliciously taking the group away or whether I just sitting down. Long story short he accused me of being malicious even though I'm certain I wasn't. Just distant to avoid some of the behaviors I didn't  like.

Basically at the end of this I've been called insensitive, unable to deal with people emotionally and difficult because I don't want Steph to treat me the way she does. 

Any advice would be great before this gets worse. I don't know what I've done or if I've acted in an insensitive way because I feel as though too many people are telling me I have. Maybe its because I've avoided speaking about it to others and she hasn't. HELP PLEASE!

28848,Non-Romantic,27lses,"My boyfriend has several medical issues, and one of his prescribed meds is Ritalin. My friend (I'll call her Jane) has also been on Ritalin for a number of years. The bf (call him Mark) was laid off for a time, then found a position but had no insurance. Due to this, doctors appointments and scripts were whittled down to the necessities. not only were we not wealthy to begin with, but I was pregnant and we knew we had to save up for when I stopped working after having the baby.


Mark was having a tough time keeping focused and having energy to help pick up where I was slacking(I had a high risk pregnancy) and knowing this, since she was our best friend, Jane came to us(this is important) and OFFERED, to sell Mark her script every month. She said that she didn't take it anymore, but always has plenty, and wanted to help him out so we had one less worry or financial burden. I was leery of this arrangement, but told them that if they were ok, it was their choice, I would prefer to be left out of it. 


For a while things went smoothly, although she would never sell the whole refill at once, it was always in parts. Then Jane said she would be taking some of her monthly refill for herself, so she would have less to sell to mark. Ok, no big deal, he would ration and only take them when really necessary. 


Then, about a month ago (2 months after the baby was born) Jane was over helping out, which she often was. She told us that she was again not taking the meds, so mark could have the whole refill. She said she would fill it the next day. He sent her a text a few days later asking if he could just pay her for the whole months worth at once, that way it was just done, only he said can Forgetit2737 and I just buy the months worth instead of a few at a time? 

She responded is forgetit2737 taking these?. He told her no, he just meant we are paying for them. She then told him she's breastfeeding, she can't be taking Ritalin!. He again told her, no, she doesn't take them. Her response was I haven't filled it yet, but I don't feel comfortable now. I talked to a pharmacist and Ritalin will hurt the baby!. All he said was you should know forgetit2737 better after all these years. Then he came home and told me what happened. 


I didn't say anything to her. The next day she sent a message saying that mark took what she said out of context, and was just trying to start a fight. When I told her I had read the messages myself, and was extremely hurt by the accusation that I would intentionally hurt my kid, she tried a different approach. She said that she just wanted an excuse not to sell them anymore, because mark wanted all her pills and wouldn't leave her alone. I told her again that I read the message (one message) about buying them, and it didnt seem to me to be him bullying her. All of a sudden it was that she just couldn't stand mark, and he is annoying, blah blah blah. I only responded that her messages and excuses keep getting more hurtful, and I would be waiting for her apology. 


That was the last direct message. I still have not gotten an apology. Now, she has been leaving comments on facebook about missing me, and the baby, but nothing about Mark. And honestly, I miss her too. However, I still feel hurt and I feel I'm owed at least an apology.  I also feel that she owes Mark one too, since she was so hurtful towards him too.  I am also really confused about why this all happened in the first place. We were all such good friends, I don't know what changed. Am I not seeing something I should?  Is this something I should just let go?

28849,Non-Romantic,2pp7ay,"UPDATE:  apology accepted. Life goes on.

I met her three years ago. She's a little older than me, has a teenage daughter, but is tall and gorgeous. Guarded at work, though when I've seen her socially she's hugged me. This is the first year at the office party we were both single, and talked more than ever before.

When the party wraps, we go to another bar to catch up with a coworker who has already left. We sit and drink several rounds together. I'm paying and she keeps suggesting that she owes me lunch or drinks another time. Every time she suggests that she may need to go, I ask whether I should close out or whether she wants another? She stays. She hints repeatedly at an attraction but expresses professional concern (she's much more career-oriented than I am and though we both have a strong work/life separation, she seems to feel she has much more at stake). She talks about doing cool stuff together but when I say 'hang out' she asks what that means. She calls me awkward as fuck but also cute in a non-patronizing way. At three or four points on the barstools the cues are so strong that I have to force myself not to lean in. It feels like the worst sort of bad idea--the mistake you knowingly make.

And then:  at the end of the night, we walk out together. She hugs me at the waist. I take this as a sign and I kiss her. She doesn't open her mouth, we make short eye contact, and say goodbye hurredly.

She'd given me her number earlier that night. I texted her this morning with a soft apology (Sorry if I overread the situation) and an overture about lunch. I haven't heard anything, and it's making me nervous.

I've been on the receiving end of drunken misreads and unwelcome kisses before. I know how tricky it can be to clarify things again--for a person to completely express fault without making a silly mistake a huge deal.

And... I don't know how to handle this. I don't know how to tell her in the least drama-free way that yes, I think she's beautiful, and I have since we met (I drunkenly admitted that last night). But if we never date, that's fine. Our offices are adjacent but we barely talk at work, and I won't try to change that. I certainly won't tell anybody what happened or let anything happen to undermine her professionally. At some point, her silence will indicate that a more formal apology is needed--but when? My location is her secondary office, it's likely I won't see her til Monday. If she's upset by this, it'd be unfair to wait that long, and though I hope she'd tell me if she were upset, it's self-justifying to rely on that.

This is really bothering me. I hope it's not a big mess, but really want to clean it up if so.

28856,Non-Romantic,27500e,"So I've been volunteering at the nursing home for a couple days (not that long) and on Friday I saw the same person for the third time. I was her first visitor in a very long time and she seemed excited to see me but.. some of her comments about me are making me uncomfortable and I don't want to say anything because I might hurt her feelings but I also don't want to stop visiting her. I feel bad and I feel like I have a really thin skin and she probably...doesn't really know what she's saying because she's like really really really old and is like 'gone' most of the time except when I'm there and even then she seems kind of out of it.

Okay so specifically on Friday I went to see her except this time I brought music. I compiled a list of songs that were popular in the 40's/50's (some from both) and brought them in on my laptop. I played them in the background while talking to her and she seemed to like that a lot. I used the music to open up a conversation about what music she liked when she was younger and she listed a bunch of songs and seemed very lucid.

I went from there to talk about history because she started talking about what she was doing when she listened to the songs etc etc. and how it was back then. I was pretty engulfed in what she was saying. 

And then she started talking about men. She mentioned her late husband when she first met him and what he looked like and how he was so attractive and things he did and then she looked at me and said 

He was really a man....he was like just the opposite of you. She would talk about other people that she remembered that she knew and oftentimes she would take the time to point out (during her very interesting stories they really were it was fascinating I love history)  how unlike I was other people and how...weird I was compared to them. She said very specifically You're a really weird kid you know? that's okay I guess don't worry about it and other odd things like that.

As soon as she said them she seemed to forget she said them and just kept going on. I started to feel bad as it went on but kept up what I was doing (switching songs continuously on my laptop and asking her about what was going on if/when she heard the song) until she had to use the restroom and I decided to leave. I see her every day and I'm not sure what to do about this. She's made comments about me/to me before friday and I just kind of brushed them off but I'm not sure what to do now.

28862,Non-Romantic,2ii1sm,"So guys, basically what is going on: I have an amazing girlfriend whom I love very much, and what I'll call my best friend. 

My friend recently (~2-3 months) got out of a relationship and he told me before my problem happened, that my girlfriend reminds him of his ex, that our pictures remind him of the ones he used to take, made very sexual notions towards me and my gf, and other things like that (his girlfriend dumped him after 1 1/2 years). I thought: ok, kind of unsual, but ok and shrugged it off. That was roughly 2 weeks ago. This friday we had a dance and he had a emotional breakdown when he saw us slow dancing together and being so in love with each other, and at my girlfriend's after party me and my friend were the last people left aside from my girlfriend, he refused to leave her house until I left (him wanting alone time with my girlfriend basically).

Today I'm eating lunch with my girlfriend, and one of our very good friends comes up and after some small talk, and tells us someone *really* wants to break us up and that that person wanted him to do it. We start saying names and eventually it clicks to me, It's my friend (we'll call him T). It's not hard to figure out that he's attracted to her after all I've seen and heard and I wanted to strangle that idiot when I saw him today, (the same day he asked my friend to try and break us up) but that's not a really good idea at the moment. I can tell he knew something was wrong by the way he was talking and acting in front of me.

My girlfriend has been through various situations where guys wanted her to cheat on me but she would refuse and immediately tell me what was going on, so please take that into consideration. My girlfriend definitely doesn't want me to leave this alone, but we've known each other for years now that she doesn't want me to get into a huge conflict with my best friend but I fear this is the only way it will end. From my girlfriend: I think T is an amazing person but I don't know how to keep this friendship going if this continues, so she doesn't approve of this either.

Now you guys, what do? I seriously can't let this go on but I need to end this before it gets worse.

I had been friends with this girl since around 13 years, and we stuck together. We never were looking for a deeper relationship, and we were more brother sister type. She even had a few boyfriends throughout our friendship.

Some of my peers had bullied me earlier on for my race and other thins. (Not important) and started again, but with me and this girl. They spread sexual and just wrong rumors about us and she heard. At first she understood but eventually snapped and swore me out on some text and acts ignorant of my presence. 

I've let her be for around two months now, and I miss her. We were only a week from going on a vacation and hat was ruined. I wen got my phone records and email records to prove I didn't send any texts to the liars. She doesn't care and I know it's probably best to move on, but what should I do? I stay up thinking about her and worry for her. We always kept way other on a good path, correcting mistakes. She makes some bad choices (of course we all do) and I feel upset I can't be there for her.

28871,Non-Romantic,1vpdf1,"This is not about me (f23), but about some very close friend of mine who is very important to me. Let's call her Lucy.


Lucy (F24) is in a relationship with her best friend (f25) from highschool. Let's call her Sam. They've been together for 5 years. Lucy has had 2 boyfriends before falling in love with Sam. And Sam had never dated anyone before Lucy (not boys nor girls).Anyway, they have been living together for 3 years.

They are mad in love with each other and I can't imagine them not being together. They just seem so in sync and made for each other, it's hard to imagine they could have any problems.


But recently, Lucy told me they've being going through some rough patch. They've been having some issue in their sex life. Sam in extremely self conscious and she has being feeling very bad about herself and her body for some time now. But it got worse since last summer. Apparently, they rarely make love anymore, Sam always insists on keeping her clothes on, refuses to be touched on some places and refuses a lot of the things Lucy wants to do (to please her). Lucy told me she's been bored for 6 monts now, she feels like they barely have sex anymore, there is no passion and it is always the same routine. It's not the sex part that Lucy misses the most she told me, it's the connection between them during those times that seems to have disapeared. They don't make love anymore, they just do their business and there no spark or passion during those moments. Lucy asked Sam to see some therapist (Sam doesn't want to talk about it with a stranger), she keeps telling her how beautiful and desirable she is... nothing seems to work.



Anyway, Lucy confessed something to me last night and I wasn't sure what to say about it. I tried to be the least judgmental as I could because she's a very close friend, I love her (in a friendly way obviously), I saw how bad she felt about her relationship with Sam and I didn't want to upset her... But I was really disapointed by what she told me and I want you to help me see/understand better her side of this. Or to tell me what I should have adviced her...

She kissed a man at a night club 2 nights ago. She said she wanted to feel desired, and that she felt so relieved/accomplished when she went home. Apparently she thought about it the moment she saw this man, it was not some drunken mistake. She let him talk to her, didn't flirted heavily, she just smiled, she was friendly and spent 20 minutes talking with him, she just let him flirt with her. And when she was about to leave the club to go home, she grabbed him and kissed him.


She said she didn't see this as a break of trust, that it meant nothing to her on an emotional level and that she would never have slept with him or anyone else than her SO. She doesn't plan on telling Sam at all (who I like very much also, that's also why I am not sure what to do, even though I know I won't tell Sam anything because this is not my place) She said it was like she was masturbating, like she was just using this man to feel good about herself and that apparently it worked.



To me this as nothing to do with some sex issue, to me it is way deeper than what Lucy wants to admit. She crossed a line, and she knew exaclty what she was doing. And she does'nt even feel any remorse about this. I know some people think that a (deep) kiss is not cheating, but I know that SHE knows Sam would consider this cheeting. She blamed it all on Sam and her insecurities. I think they have a real problem to deal and it's not just related to sex, something is wrong and they need to figure out what it is and why they're drifting appart.


I need you to tell me what you think of this. Do you side with Lucy on this? What am I/are they missing? Do you think she should tell Sam? What should I do ? Lucy is one of my closest friend and I care deeply about Sam as well, this is messing with my head and I just want them to be okay...

28886,Non-Romantic,2yy7j8,"I've been going to the gym with my roommate for about a year, but I enjoy going alone by myself. He is a very sensitive guy, and his feelings are extremely delicate.

The reasons I enjoy going by myself is because I enjoy the way I workout, and I feel like I don't make as much progress with the way he does things. He always wants me to follow his routines, and I don't feel they are as effective. In addition to that, he never does legs, which I love to do. 

I've tried telling him that I am going to try to do legs that day at the gym, but he says wait, how about we do legs (this day), and do (this workout) today. At first I would agree, because I thought it would be alright if I waited a few days until I can do legs. But then when the day comes he complains and says that he doesn't want to do legs, and refuses to do them. So then I get really annoyed because he made me wait all this time until I could finally do what I wanted to do, then makes me do the same thing we do every other day. And this happens repetitively. 

I also find it more difficult to find time for the gym. my class schedule is packed, and I only have a few hours where I would be able to make it, but now he makes it difficult for me because I have to wait until he has free time, too. So now, I'm only able to go a few times a week, where I would prefer to go 4 to 5 times a week.

I enjoy just spending time to myself at the gym. I am somewhat of an introvert and I enjoy my alone time. The gym was one place where I could just keep to myself and my thoughts, with my earphones, and I don't enjoy the gym as much when I have to spend the time with someone else. I enjoy hanging out with him outside of the gym, but not while I'm exercising.

I suggest that we do some of the exercises that I want to do when we are at the gym, but he just responds with I hate doing that, meanwhile he forces me to do his own exercises. I have tried telling him that I want to do my own routine when we go to the gym. When I told him that I was going to do something different than him, he became really upset, and held a grudge against me for a few hours. He kept saying that we are supposed to be a team and do things together, and he took it as an attack on his character.

One of these relatives is my 21 year old cousin Francesco, who is born and raised in Italy but speaks perfect English. We talk a lot when I am home in the US and I know him very well. 

I am back this summer because I am a college student spending the semester in Rome. I went over a little earlier to stay with my family for a bit. I had been sleeping in Francesco's bed while he slept in other places, but then one night he wanted his room because he has musical equipment in there and he needed it to study for upcoming exams.His younger brother (19), Lorenzo, has two beds in his room and said I could stay in his room for the night. Everyone else goes to bed and Lorenzo and I have some pretty deep conversations about people in our family. This includes Francesco...we talked about how he has anger and control issues, problems with girls (he has never had a girlfriend) problems being arrogant and narcissistic....and how we worried for him. And then I ask him what is the worst thing Francesco has ever done. Lorenzo doesn't want to tell me so I ask if he'll tell me if I guess correctly. I ask did he do something physical? Something he said? Did he damage someone's property? Lorenzo says no no no....I then ask Is it something sexual? and he hesitates. So now I know I'm warmer. Lorenzo is saying things like You can't know...he would kill himself but after a couple minutes he eventually tells me Francesco was taking pictures of girls and women he knew, including his mother and his 16 year old cousin and his female friends and his friends mothers and basically modifying them so they were naked and stuff (I don't know exactly how he did it) and then one of his friends found the pictures (which had his own mother in it) and he told another friend who told his mother about it. Francesco's parents end up being told. They confront him apparently and he cries and says he needs help. They go to two therapy sessions as a family. I ask Lorenzo if he did one of me, and he says no but who knows if thats the truth. Now he hushes me and is getting texts from Francesco that reveal that he was standing outside the door and heard everything. I can't tell you everything he was saying to Lorenzo because it was in Italian but there were things like I thought you were my brother...you destroyed me...everyday I wake up trying to make things better for everyone and I fail everyday It was the first time I had ever seen him say negative things about himself. Lorenzo assured him everything was alright and we went to bed. The next morning Francesco took me to the train station to return to Rome and acted as though nothing happened. I stayed in contact with Lorenzo that day and he said he was being nice and acting normal. On the train, I sent Francesco a message that said

Hey, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about what happened last night. I pushed Lorenzo into telling me. I just want you to know that even though you make mistakes, you aren't a bad person or a failure and I know how you feel. I don't know how much you heard and I'm sorry we upset you. You know you can't please everyone everyday and that's ok. What you can do is try to respect everyone's feelings more and not say such hurtful things sometimes. Anyway, I love you a lot and I always will. I'm always here for you

He responds that night saying Thank you (my name)...it really means a lot. I love you too and I want you to know that. Hope you have a nice Italian lesson :)

I have my first week of school and all seems well. According to Lorenzo, the whole picture scandal incident happened last Spring. Lorenzo says Francesco is fine and then he drops it. One thing I did learn the night we were talking is that Francesco starting keeping a passcode to enter his iPhone after getting caught. This to me was a red flag that he was hiding something. The following Thursday I am sitting behind him in the car and I see him enter the passcode to his iPhone. Now I normally understand its wrong to hack into someones phone/computer or whatever, but his 16 year old cousin also from the States that he had made photos of in the past had just come and gone for 3 weeks that summer (I'll call her Marie) so I was a bit concerned. 


So during the weekend I am staying with the relatives, Francesco and some friends go outside and he leaves his iPhone in his room. I take it and go to his photos....there were about maybe 15 pictures of Marie, and all of them she was either in a bikini, there were a couple rather risque ones of her with a friend, and photos of her in a bikini top using her arms to make it look like she had big cleavage. Most of these photos I did not recognize from her Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram (I went and checked) so I then checked his Facebook to see his messages to her. She isn't sending them. So I have no idea where he's getting them. She wouldn't send them to him. And what else I also found in his photos were a bunch of his 14 year old cousin Emily (Marie's sister) that he took while she was visiting. These weren't sexual in nature, just of her sort of standing around, they were kinda blurry. It was clear she did not know he was taking these photos. 

I know he is going to take these photos of Marie and Emily and modify them further (essentially making fake child porn) and I know that it would really hurt the family if their parents found out. Marie/Emily's father is close to Francesco and really loves and respects him. Francesco's parents and Lorenzo all I assume think that he isn't still doing this. I didn't say anything to Francesco the day I saw the pictures because of a music exam he was taking today. I decided the timing was bad so I want to tell him this weekend that I know about the pictures. I don't see the need to tell anyone else in the family unless he continues to not stop doing it. Any advice? Am I doing the right thing?

28906,Non-Romantic,276oeh,"Me(18) and this girl Lucy(18) dated when we were both 16, it never really worked out because we both had no idea what we were doing and the fired died out. We both had similliar ambitions and got along really well we were really a good fit for each other it was just awkward timing. It lasted a couple months and we broke up, after that she dated another guy for about a year and half and we never really talked much during that time. Every now and again we would have a witty conversation over facebook but that was it. A little under two years later I messaged her on facebook and we immediately hit if off and had a long hilariously witty conversation. After that we started snapchatting and eventually we started snapping each other almost every day. Sometimes we would get a little flirty but it was nothing serious. It was just for fun, I didn’t think she liked me at all because she had just got out of a relationship and she did little things like call me “man” and try to set me up with a friend early on when we first started talking. She would respond every time and usually within five minutes and they would always be interesting and ellicit further response. So anyways as we started talking a lot we organized a bon fire at her house. When I got there Lucy seemed kind of nervous (On our first date when we were 16 she was so nervous her hands were shaking). Lucy her female friend and another female friend and her boyfriend came and we all got pretty drunk. Eventually me lucy and her female friend started spooning togather and eventually making out. After a while lucy left to go to the bathroom  and me and her female friend basically had sex, Lucy never came back and when we finished up we found her by the fire and started to all kiss and cuddle again Lucy didn’t seem to care and she knew we did something. I groped Lucy pretty much all over, she was at the very least fine with it.

In the morning I hugged them both goodbye and Lucy thanked me for coming and bringing the alcohol. I snapped her the next day and she responed something boring like an hour later, not really anything to carry a conversation. She snapped me first once that week but it died out quick because she didn’t really say anything. I snapped her just a couple times that week but she didn’t respond like she use too if at all. This week Lucy has a graduation party with the same female friend and I commented on the page asking if there would be a bounce house because a mutual friend would only come if there was, something she would find, normally, at least somewhat witty and humorous. But she just responded “tell him to ask me himself”and that was that. I can tell there is something unsaid between us or she is mad at me for some reason or another but im really not sure what? Do I need to expand on anything? Should I just not try to contact her and go to her graduation and see how she is then? I have mutual friends going there so I cold hang with them.

28910,Non-Romantic,2bifhs,"I met the girl in question, Angela, as a friend of one of my good friends, and once we'd started all hanging out together it turned out she and I had lots of friends and acquaintances in common. We actually were laughing just the other day about how odd it was that we'd not met before as we hang out in all the same circles and frequently get seperate invites to the same events. 

Angela is very open about events on her life. She's a sharer, and one of the things she seems to love most is sharing details about her past. I do not exaggerate when I say that anybody from the entire group of friends could recount Angela's employment history, relationship history, family issues and health problems without even thinking about it. She talks about these things frequently and they are a big part of who she is. 

By coincidence, I happen to have a unique mix of personal and professional experience which allows me to see through many of the stories she recounts over and over again as lies. 

I'll try to give some examples without being so specific as to identify anybody:

- She claims to have had a major surgical procedure, the after effects of which still trouble her to this day. I happen to work in that speciality and know that the reason she gives for having had surgery is completely fabricated (she tells that she had a symptom which could have been due to a number of reasons, that nobody could find the cause of it, and so the body part which was hurting was removed), and that the operation she claims to have had doesn't exist (she says the removed body part was replaced by an artificial part, where no such replacement exists). The first time she told me this, I told her that she must be mistaken as this isn't a thing which could have happened. She assured me that yes, it was true, that she could even feel said artificial body part through her flesh and it often caused her pain. At this point I hadn't heard the rest of the lies and felt bad for not believing her about something which obviously still caused her distress, and I discussed it with one of my colleagues to gain some outside perspective.. He is one of our country's top surgeons in this particular field, and he told me categorically that she was lying. He couldn't even think of any similar procedure which she may have been confused with. It just doesn't exist. 

- She claims to have worked in a specialized role alongside some people who are well known for doing that particular job. I happen to know a few of these people and also know some of their clients. None of them has ever met Angela. I asked her about some of the things she would have done in this job and she gave a half-assed vague description before changing the subject. Like if I had asked her what she studied at college and she'd said 'oh, just things out of textbooks, you know the stuff. Let's go get another beer! How was your day?'. She also makes a massive deal about how she excelled at another, very different job- which she did actually do- but I happen to know the people she worked for who say she was no good and they ended up letting her go. 

My problem is this: I now basically don't believe her entire backstory, which because she makes such a massive deal of it means I find it very difficult to speak with her as everything is related back to things which I know to be lies. When we hang out I feel like she's making a mockery of me and of our friends by feeding us this bullshit, but at the same time I am reluctant to call her out on it because it is so much a part of her I feel like it would destroy her to have it taken away. She is in a committed long-term relationship with a lovely guy who hangs on her every word and goes to great lengths to help her out when she has pain due to complications from her operation, and protect her from other imagined evils- to me, she is making him look like a mug, but I wouldn't want to potentially break up their relationship either. Ach, reddit, I don't know what to do! Hold my mouth and try to avoid her and avoid speaking about her, or just tell my side of the story and see what happens?

28926,Non-Romantic,2mnfk7,"My family has always had some dramas, namely caused by a clash between my mum and sister. As young as 8, I can remember being a mediator between their arguments. My sister and I went a number of years without talking due to simply not getting along (typical teenage arguments) when she moved out at 15. Over the last few years we have managed to mend that and become friends.

The last few months, though, she has begun to lash out at me or our mother over disagreements. The first was a month ago, when she decided she would like to go to university. We were supportive but also realistic about it, but she did not take the realistic parts well, such as saying university was difficult. She sent me a long facebook message telling me how family were supposed to support her and how she had done so much for us, etc. I replied but did not get anywhere. My dad talked her down from her saying that we were not being supportive enough.

Today came the second disagreement, where I refused to give some of my hay bale (for my pets) to her. There is a drought at the moment for hay so it is difficult to get. I refused as if I run out, I will have nothing to use for my animals' bedding, and she also did not offer money. This led to her sending me a long facebook message telling me I am selfish and should feel bad about myself, which I did not reply to.

At the moment she owes me around $500, which I have been struggling to get back. I am concerned that with all this drama, I am not going to be able to get the money back.

I am used to it since I was a child, watching the arguments, and have generally felt like my sister wished she was an only child and felt like she should be treated as one. My parents have brought us up well and given us all we needed - it seems to be how we accepted that between me and my siblings (younger brother, 20). My sister often says she is done with my mother and close to not having anything to do with her. I am tired of the drama being blamed on other people. I do feel she needs to solve her own problems rather than blaming other people.

How do I deal with this situation? I like to keep the peace and don't want my family not speaking to each other. I am unsure what to say to my sister when she is looking for a fight, and I often feel like I am walking on eggshells if I disagree (which I have every right to do). Any advice is appreciated.

28952,Non-Romantic,3ccit1,"My buddy has been married to his high school sweetheart since they were old enough to (11 or so years by that math). In the ~4 years we've been friends, I've noticed they live very separate lives. Most noticeably because of social media. She has a Facebook and she does not. Historically, there have been few (if any) pictures of him on her FB and never really a mention of him. I am not friends with her there, but my wife is.

My wife recently came across some posts on her page that were pictures and statuses with another man. Her boss, in fact. The oldest of these posts start out innocently enough, mostly pics of them in work situations, but they progress to being pics of the two of them riding around in his car, and pics of him with inappropriate captions regarding his looks and how he treats her. Even more curious, she has posted to her boss's *mother's* FB page, talking about how she raised a prince. 

My buddy and I get a lot of hang time lately because she's always housesitting for days or even a week at a time, but now that my wife showed me all these posts (some of which happened in the last week while she was housesitting), I am relatively sure that there's much more to this. She even posted some vague caption about it finally being the day under a picture of them last Thursday. No idea what that means, but it's sketchy at best. To top it all off, the comments from *other people* on these pictures are things like cute couple and you look happy together.

This can't be good.

Now, I've picked up that these are major red flags and need to tell him, but in a past experience with trying to expose this sort of stuff to an old friend, I ended up causing upheaval in our friendship by way of being outed as the source of the information. It basically happened because he said Soandso told me you might be cheating on me and of course she just demonized me and caused a huge rift out of her selfishness.

I don't regret giving him the heads up, but I would surely love to avoid getting dragged into any fallout over this current situation. I am a 35 year old man with a family and responsibilities and have left 99.99 percent of drama well behind in my 20s. I was careful to tell aforementioned friend *not* to say anything about his source, but love makes people do stupid things.

So, with all this in mind, what could be some good ways to go about breaking this information to him? I need to tell him before he finds out on his own. My wife made screenshots of all relevant information, but his wife is also a person with no real FB privacy settings so I can actually show him this stuff on her timeline.

He (R) messaged this to me and a few other friends today that he's divorcing his wife (H). They've been married for about 4 years and have 2 kids aged 2 and 4.  
I talked to him about it in person earlier this evening and he said basically that he felt like he was losing more and more of himself every day, that it was tiring him out and that he felt more and more tense whenever he'd be at home together with his wife.

The reasons for this were he said that she's got many issues (not sure if I'm translating this correctly...) She's got Crohn's disease and she's got it pretty badly, so she's not got a lot of energy. In addition she's got some form and amount of autism (I don't know where in the spectrum) and she's a perfectionist.  
This made him feel that despite putting in a ton of effort, working overtime, missing sleep to help take care of the kids etc. and that his effort's aren't appreciated.

All this is making him tired and stressed. 2 weeks ago he went to a LARP weekend where he started talking to a young woman(21). They hit it off wonderfully and they had sex during that event and he's been texting her ever since. He says he's fallen madly in love with her and sees this as a wakeup call because he's now suddenly realizing how terrible he feels in his marriage.

I'm thinking that he's treating his wife incredibly unfairly because A. Cheating on her. B. Blaming his wifefor the problems in the relationship, making the choice of breaking it off without giving her a chance to work out their problems.

It's all very fresh off the press, but I'm trying to push him to go to see a relationship therapist in order to help the two of them to salvage their marriage.

I'd like your thoughts on all this, and any tips or advice you can all give me.

Practically every day after work and all weekend, she goes to her boyfriend's house without her child, leaving her aging mother and my FIL to watch their grandchild, who is quickly becoming a brat. My SIL doesn't ask to borrow the car, or to ask my MIL to watch my niece anymore, just leaves. My FIL had to start work early this morning, but went to sleep angry, because my SIL took the car, and doesn't return home until four or five in the morning, and my FIL doesn't ever know when she'll be back. 

She told me first. Not my husband and not her parents. Awkward 1. I told my husband, because he's my husband, and I don't keep secrets from him. But she still hasn't told my MIL. I think it's because she knows my MIL will refuse to watch her granddaughter anymore because my SIL is acting so irresponsibly--namely not paying attention to her current child, even when she's at home (being on her phone, or telling my FIL to make the child lunch).

My fear is that she's (my SIL) already excluding her daughter from this new family she's building with her BF. 

My husband is very nonconfrontational, and doesn't want to start waves in his family, even after we went to his mom's last night, and the child rules the house with her fake tears, screams, and gestures of hitting people. I wasn't raised that way, so I don't tolerate it from this kid, either. I even told my MIL (who is the loveliest woman ever) that the kid knows she can get away with things because my MIL is trying to compensate for my SIL not being there.

I want to tell my MIL because it's not fair that she's raising my niece because my SIL doesn't want to. She wants to be involved in all the fun stuff, but the everyday stuff, she doesn't care about. My husband says no, but my MIL is tired. My FIL, who CAN retire won't do it because my SIL doesn't work enough to support herself or her daughter, and my FIL feels it's his obligation. Both my parental in-laws have diabetes, and other health problems, they shouldn't have to run around for a child, or be duped while another is on the way.

28978,Non-Romantic,2peeml,"In the fall of 2013 my boyfriend of 1.5 years (X) and his dog (Fluffy) moved in with me. The relationship really should have ended before it ever began and we broke up in the early spring of 2014. The breakup spurred him to leave town for a while and go travel so he could live out of his car and go rock climbing all summer. I hadn't had much contact with him (an occasional Facebook message) until Friday night.

On Friday night I ran into him at a party. He is back in town until the new year. I asked if Fluffy was at the party as well and she was hanging out in the heated garage. I went down to say hello to her and she is SUPER thin looking. She is a boxer, so they can be naturally skinny dogs and remain healthy. But she was very noticeably thinner than when she lived with me. You can see every rib, but her hips aren't awfully protruding (yet). X said that she had suffered from heartworms and tapeworms over the summer when I mentioned how thin she looked, but she has been treated for them. Unfortunately the bad news didn't stop at her appearance. While drinking and talking with X, he revealed the following things:

* Fluffy is no longer house broken (I guess a consequence of living out of a car)

* Fluffy is allowed to roam around the mountains and gorges that X climbs at. No leash, no collar, no microchip.

* X mentioned twice that it's **legal** to hunt dogs in the state that he has been primarily staying in

* X's philosophy is If she gets lost then that's her problem. She'll either take care of herself or she won't

* X mentioned that he hasn't gotten her fixed yet. He said She might be pregnant and if that's the case and no one wants the puppies, then I'll just get rid of them (meaning he would murder puppies)

* X visited my house after I left and didn't bring Fluffy inside. She sat in the car for an hour and a half in 20 degree Fahrenheit weather

Now I might be over-reacting but I was really appalled at his treatment of his dog. If that's not abuse then it's at least very close to neglect. I'm just not sure if I have the justification or the right to do anything about it. Or if there is even a legal avenue to actually take action to get Fluffy out of that situation. Am I over-reacting? Should I step back and stay out of it? Or do I make some sort of effort to get that dog into a warm, caring home?

My brother and I grew up with my mother and step-father, Dean, though our father wasn't absent from our lives. Our father just didn't live with us and it was a bit of a complicated relationship.

Over the years, the relationship between my brother and Dean as well as that between my mother and Dean has become increasingly worse. It is clear to me that my mother and Dean stayed together 'for the kids' (long complicated story about her cheating and having us with my father but she never left Dean) and that they do not really get along at all. They're polite with each other but my mother gets annoyed at everything he does but that isn't the point and their weird relationship needs its own entire thread. 

Dean is getting older and he's had a few medical problems that make him pretty inactive, including him being overweight. He hasn't worked in about 10 years and collects retirement/social security. I know my brother resents him for this because he feels he should just 'push through' and be active and get over himself + stop being lazy. He believes Dean exaggerates feeling bad or tired or sick, which he may be doing, he's a bit of a hypochondriac.

My brother has recently told me that he plans to have a long talk with my stepfather, Dean, telling him about all the ways that Dean has let him down. He feels Dean is lazy, has been a bad father figure, has failed him in many areas, etc. 

Dean loves me and my brother very much and I know that what my brother would tell him would absolutely crush him. Dean absolutely did his best to be a wonderful parent to my brother and I but finances and his health and all of that have definitely begun to deteriorate as of lately. 
I understand my brother's desires to get this off his chest but Dean is older now, my brother is an adult, there's no way to change what has happened and all this would do is make their relationship even more tense, break Dean's heart, and ruin the holidays for everyone. 

How do I handle this situation? I'd ideally like to avoid my brother telling my stepfather all of this stuff because it would be a nightmare for everyone. I understand that my brother is struggling with the realization that he never had a concrete father figure because we grew up in a somewhat weird situation though, and I want to be sympathetic to that. 

Edit: what I am trying to ask here is whether there'd be a better way to unload these issues than all at once on Christmas and how I can try and convince my brother to consider that instead of a huge bombshell. I'm not asking him to keep it bottled up or whatnot.

Linda said she's able to give him a ride after Linda's boyfriend's (21/M) surgery in this exact sentence Tell Seth I will be able to if my boyfriend feels better after the surgery. I nodded and told her that I'm going to tell my friend what Linda told me. 

-------------------------------------------------------
Fast forward to today, Seth came over and asked me about Linda's boyfriend surgery. Linda's boyfriend and Seth was very close during high school so naturally Seth got curious. I told him the surgery will be quick and painless, that was it. We talked about something different immediately after that

-------------------------------------------------------

I got text from Linda freaking out which got on my nerve.
-------
Linda: OMG you told EVERYONE about my bf's surgery? You ran out of your own shit to talk about so you dug into ours? You didn't have common sense to think just maybe just maybe that was private? Not only that, now Seth is telling my bf about everything you said. My bf's mad and so am I. You can't shut up and that's disappointing.
-----
Me: *taken off guard* I didn't tell everyone but Seth
-------
Linda: Seriously. Find your own stuff to talk about with people, leave us out of it. We don't have an interest in being your own gossip subject. He shouldn't have to tell you, he doesn't want people to know, yet you just spewed it at other people with no regard to his privacy. 
---------
Me: It's not a gossip? You guys never mentioned it was private. Anyway, I got to go. (I was putting phone away to spend some time with sick grandma)
---------
Linda: He shouldn't have to! Now we have to label what's private and what's not? You have no common sense to figure that out yourself or even ask? Oh yeah you gotta go so you're leaving your CELL PHONE. Yes I'm not stupid, genius. 
----------------------------------------------

I ignored her texts afterward. I honestly wanted to lose it that moment but I didn't. She's extremely narcissistic, which is why my friends and I don't want her around us during parties or gathering. I wanted to call her out on it but she will always back-up and lie or start rumor later on. I honestly didn't remember they saying it was private, she talked about it with me in open.  
----------------------------


I know I'm not the smartest bulb out there as English isn't my first but third language, and I'm pure stupid sometimes but she know my deepest insecurity is not having lot of common sense. She would usually call me dumb, stupid, retarded, etc during our normal hang out. It hurts sometimes but I try not to take it personal. I usually keep things to myself. My sister suggested to poke at Linda's insecurity in return but I am not the one to hurt people. I honestly feel like I'm losing it. Any advice?

Sometimes when we danced she would get very close to me, but I was very recently broken up so I wasn't in the mood to be pursuing another relationship so quick. 

On the weekend I held a small party at my place, and people got very drunk. By the end most people left, and she lived far so she crashed at my place.

29039,Non-Romantic,2hh9gm,"Hi everyone, longtime lurker but first time poster so excuse any mistakes. I'm using a throwaway for privacy reasons as my friends know my account and at the minute I want to keep this problem a secret. 

So a bit of background. I've [27] been friends with Katy (28) since we were at school together. This girl and I have been through everything together and I would trust her with my life! She's always been my go to person and we've created a lot of good memories. 

When I was around 15 or so I started to identify myself as bisexual. I experimented around and during this time Katy supported me as I told my parents and explored my interest in girls. Never once during this time did she act weird or like she had a crush on me, or at least I never noticed. She just seemed like my typical best friend. When I was 18 and just starting uni I met my current fiancé Adam [28m]. Things got serious pretty quickly and we've been together since! I've never felt like I was missing out with girls or anything. 

Katy and Adam have always been super close and got on brilliantly. She has always been supportive of my relationship with him and he has been supportive of my friendship with her. We all like to hang out a lot and there's no awkwardness or pressure until very recently. This is obviously a big relief for me as I don't have to stress about my best friend and SO not getting along or splitting my time between them. 

Now here's the problem; About a year ago Adam and I got engaged! We had always talked about it but decided to wait until we were older, had a job, money etc. I was over moon, I've always felt sure that Adam was the person who I wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with. I met up with Katy the next day to break the news but she seemed more upset that happy. I repeatedly asked her what was wrong but she insisted that she was so happy for me, it was about time etc. but she could hardly wait to change the subject and seemed less than enthusiastic. I asked her to be my maid of honour and she said sure, I just need to check what I have going on so I'll get back to you. I was pretty upset with her. I talked to Adam and he suggested that she maybe just felt that her friend was going off and getting married leaving her with no one as she has no boyfriend. Fine, no problem, I'll just give her a couple of days to process everything. 

Katy rings me up a few days later agreeing to be my MOH on the condition that I'm really really super sure about marrying Adam. I told her of course I am and laughed at how she was playing the overprotective friend now. She laughed it off and things seemed to go back to normal. However she did seem to make a point of seeing Adam less and less to the point where it really hurt his feelings as they were close before. 

These past few months things have started to come to a head. I've been seeing less and less of her, she's hard to get a hold of and when I ask her opinion on things she's very yeah, whatever you want, I don't mind. I keep reminding her she agreed to be my MOH and if it's too much hassle that's fine but she insists she fine, work is just crazy at the minute. I actually started to wonder if she has fancied Adam this whole time. 

I talked it over with Adam and a couple of friends who all agreed I just need to talk it out with her once and for all. I missed my friend, I needed her help, I had to sort this out. I text Katy saying I need to talk to you and she invited me around to her house last night. I pour my heart out to her, how she's never there anymore, I miss her, I need her help and to know what's going on with her that's making her act so distant. She listens and then finally just breaks down in tears and I'm completely shocked! She won't tell me what's wrong so I give her a hug and suddenly she's kissing me. I immediately pull away and say what the fuck! (Probably not the best reaction but I was so stunned). She starts confessing about how she's always loved me but was too scared to say anything,  how I can't marry Adam without at least giving her a chance, we are already best friends so it would be easy. At this point I can't deal so I tell her I'm going home and leave. 

Since last night she keeps blowing up my phone with texts asking me to talk to her, I've only responded once to say I love Adam, I'm not leaving him and then turned my phone off but I've so many questions. I'm really confused by all of this. Of course I love Adam with all my heart and have no intention of leaving but I really don't know how to handle this. I haven't told Adam or anyone else yet as I'm still trying to process it myself. I'm scared that there's no going back after this and I'm going to lose my best friend. What do I do? :(

29042,Non-Romantic,2gfntg,"BACK STORY: I just recently became friends with Lenny at the start of this year. Its non-romantic because he is gay, people always ask. He just moved to my city so for the first few months I helped him find a job and invited him over a lot and cooked and basically tried to make him feel at home because I knew he had little to no money. 


START OF PROBLEM: He is a very nice guy and and is very grateful for the help I have given him, BUT as time has gone on he has gotten really comfortable in my home to the point where he makes a mess. At first he was a new guest in my home and was really polite as guests are and I didnt mind cleaning up after him, but as time went on he would get more comfortable make more of a mess and I am now feeling like he really needs to clean his own mess because he is not a stranger in my home. 

1. It bothers me that he doesn't clean his plate/ the table when he is done eating. He generally crashes on the couch and does it in the morning. I usually do it since I hate for that stuff to be laying out all night. 


2. It really bothers me that he cant wash a dish or clean a surface properly. The dishes and counters still have crud on them. This is the mess he makes when he cooks, so im not asking him to clean anything else other then his mess. 


3. He doesn't wash or wipe when he eats or cooks with his hands soo the cabinets and handles are all sticky. I told him to stop with the sticky fingers. 


I thought all of this was because he was being lazy and too comfortable in my home. I had given him a stern talk about cleaning things properly and although he seemed a little put off ( like a mom talking to her kid) I felt like I had put the issue to rest. 


MEAT OF THE PROBLEM: I was willing to let this all go until I left for vacation for two weeks and gave him the keys. I cleaned my entire place and left. I came back and at first glance the entire place looked clean and he got me a nice new plant and some snacks since I had to empty the fridge before I left. Then I realized that he had cleaned his way. The floors were sticky, the counter had sauce crust on it, my cabinets had grime all over the handles, and my damn stove top that I spent a good hour cleaning and de-greasing before I left had a nice thick layer of grease splatter on it. OH and all of my clear glasses had a nice fog on them.


He really thinks he did a good job cleaning. I almost wonder if he has bad eye sight. I cant have him over thinking he can have free reign over my place and not clean it properly. I vented to my cousin and she is more relaxed about stuff than I am and was kind of laughing at me. But I explained to her that I had cleaned my place before I left and he essentially trashed it. After a 11hr flight I had to clean my cabinets, counter tops, and floors. How do I teach/ tell him how to clean properly? I want to do this nicely to avoid an issue in our relationship but I have to do it because I will stop having him over if he continues to make a mess and not clean properly.


OK I might be a little over reacting on this but none of my other friends or family would do this.

Last year, he began dating a girl in the year above us, and the two if them have been dating for a year now. At the start of their relationship, I didn't know her very well, but as time went on and it became apparent their relationship wasn't going to last, I made a concerted effort to get to know her better. 

As it turns out, she is a nice, interesting person to whom to speak -- when she is willing to speak at all. About as often as not, she will show up to school and basically refuse to engage. Whensoever this occurs, I do my best to engage her in conversation -- I try to bring up things she does as extracurriculars or outside of school, and my friend does too. However, she only gives small, noncommittal responses and thus conversation shrivels.

29050,Non-Romantic,2xei5b,"Hello /r/relationships.

I attend a life drawing group that runs once a week out of a local art supply store. It's an incredibly affordable thing to go to (only 7$ a week or 20$ a month) compared to art classes (I pay 100+$ for instruction per month) and the experience of being able to draw from a live model is priceless. Additionally, as an unknown artist it is also a fantastic place to network. Our group includes people employed by Marvel and artists who have had their work featured as the cover on popular art magazines.

It's a very casual group. There's no instruction. You show up, find a spot, and draw for three hours (with 10 minute breaks here or there.) Then you leave. There's usually some banter and friendly conversation during breaks, and everyone in the group has the opportunity to announce their own shows and events coming up. There's no contract, no real obligation to show up every week. The same people generally show every time, but the attendance fluctuates a lot. It's a small group, less than 15 people.

Two other important notes: The model is nude unless it is the first session of the month (those are costumed poses). I have done nude modeling for the group before. (Twice. It pays well and I enjoy the experience.)

Now, on to the problem.

There's an older couple at the group who apparently come regularly. I think they may be together. He calls her his 'friend', not wife, though. The male of the half we'll call David because that's his name. I don't know the woman's name, so we'll call her Snow.

At the session three weeks ago, David took a particular interest in me. He and his friend sat next to me and he watched me draw. The group is open to all skill levels and while I am absolutely not the most skilled artist there I'm definitely not bad at what I do. I guess my work impressed him because he began asking all sorts of questions about how I draw and why I did certain things to my piece.

This was fine with me. I was polite- friendly, even. I definitely want to make other artsy-friends and at that time, though some of his questions were odd (how many colors are you using when I was doing a black and white charcoal piece) and admittedly did interrupt my work, I didn't mind answering them. David and Snow ended up leaving the group really early to attend to a family matter. I finished my piece, and all was fine, really.

Then, the following week (the Tuesday before last), David shows up alone. Apparently the family had another emergency. David sat next to me and began striking up conversation. At first, it was little things like Oh, you're painting this time? What paints do you use? but then things got a little weird.

He got *really* close to me. I could feel his breath on me and I could smell some form of liqueur on his breath. I don't drink, but my father was an alcoholic for most of my life. He began to pester me to finish certain parts of my piece and made it incredibly hard to work.

He would constantly go to the bathroom to take calls and it was at about our third break that I noticed he hadn't drawn anything. We were just given hand-outs that day about how people who aren't drawing shouldn't be in the room because the model is nude.

When he emerged from the bathroom he came up and asked me if I'd ever modeled before. I said yes. He got close to me again and asked in the most creepy tone: You do the nude, right?
And then when I answered yes, I've done nude *artistic modeling* before, he started badgering me to sign up to do it again and promised me he would be there to draw once I did it.

At one point I heard what sounded like a phone beeping and I turned around and caught David standing immediately behind me *filming* and taking pictures of both *me* and my art *without my consent.*

After the session was over I noticed he had not drawn a single thing all session. Not one single mark. I didn't notice if he had taken pictures of the model or not as well, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. While my husband and I were packing my stuff up, he legitimately stood right next to me and silently stared at me until we left.

Once we were in the car, I told my husband about David's actions during the session and asked if he thought they were creepy. I have a lot of anxiety and several anxiety disorders, so my creeper alarm can definitely go off for no good reason. However, husband agreed David was being a creep and harassing me. I also told my art *teacher* at the class I take and she (and the students) agreed David was being really creepy.

I missed last week's class due to snow. David told me his friend, Snow, would be modeling last week, but because of the winter storm we didn't make it.

I really want to go this Tuesday, because it truly does help me artistically, but I don't know what to do about David.

Here are some options:

1. Have my husband play bodyguard and come to the sessions with me. This really isn't feasible because not only is my husband not a visual artist, but he works full time and can't make it to every session. Additionally, husband and I are both very conflict avoiding type of people and we want to stop being that.

2. Husband suggested writing a letter to the person in charge of the group. Because the group is so casual, I think it might be better to speak to someone in person in confidence.

3. The current person who puts the group together and collects the money and everything is a young (20s-30s) man by the name of Austin. I'm comfortable talking to him, but I also feel like he might brush me and my complaint off. The second-in-command sort of person is an older woman (40s-50s) named Terry. Terry helps set up the space and occasionally collects the money. I feel more comfortable talking to Terry about it, but not sure if I should involve Austin at all.

4. Someone at my art class said the person who owns the actual store our sessions take place in would want to know. Phil (50sM) is not present for the actual sessions. He's super friendly to all the artists but at the end of the day isn't involved with the actual running of the group. We pay rent to use his space.

So, I want to stand my ground and not let McCreepy ruin what was previously a good experience for me. I just don't know how to go about solving this problem. Help me /r/relationships, you're my only hope!

Let's start from the beginning. I woke up this morning at about half seven and heard my mum crying in her bedroom (my door was open and hers was half open and we have relatively thin walls upstairs) so I went in and asked her what's wrong. She said I wouldn't understand, but I pestered her to tell me. So she did, and I've never felt so angry. It turns out - as said above - that my mum's partner is getting married this Saturday and he hasn't even bothered to tell her, and she only found out by looking on his Facebook and seeing messages between him and the women he is marrying.

My sister, 19, who just the day before had throat surgery to remove a potentially cancerous lump, then walked in and saw the scene and began crying along with my mum. We managed to all get the day off school/work They then called my brother, 25, who turned up with his girlfriend. Together, we all sat in the living room and discussed random things and tried to cheer up my mum. My brother and I went out to make cups of tea and we had a rather short talk about what we should do. My brother said we should find out where my mum's partner is and deal with him when we find him. I said that was silly and would only aggravate the situation. After some trying, I made my brother swear he wouldn't over react. He said something like How could you not be angry? I want to kill him so badly! to which I replied, I am angry, I've never been angry like this in my life, but I don't want to overreact and make the situation worse. This is between my mother and *him*. This isn't our place, we can only support mum through making her feel better and helping her for a bit. 

Begrudgingly, we made the tea and went back in the living room. A few hours later, my brother and his girlfriend left so they could take care of my nephew, 4, who has been a bit ill recently.

Let's give some information about my mum's partner. I've never liked him and always had my suspicions about him. He is a dick. A massive dickhead. He and my mum have had so many arguments over this past year, four of which became a physical fight. I've never fought with him, but he's a black belt in Judo so I've never dared to intervene (He's quite short and me and my brother are both over six foot), but I called the police on the two most recent occasions, to which he left for about two weeks and came back to my mother. I said something along this line, One of these days he's going to hurt you so bad, it won't matter what he says. Don't come crying to me if he breaks your arm or something. Yeah, thinking about that now, that was callous and I apologized after, but you get the gist that I was bloody tired of it. 

He is a violent man and has threatened me, my sister, and my brother as well with violence if we cross him (which we invariably do because whatever we do it seems to annoy him.) We all hate him and have told my mum this. She said, You don't know him, he loves me and I love him! We said something along the lines of, How can he love you if he beats you and you have to call the police on him? End it, or we will. A bit dramatic, but that's the truth. 

I have no idea what to do. I'm not a violent person, but I want to track him down, and for want of a better phrase, beat the shit out of him. He's getting married NEXT SATURDAY and hasn't had the fucking balls to tell my mum. He's been fucking some women for god knows how long and I think he's such a fucking scumbag. What should I do, apart from support my mum emotionally? I feel like such a waste of space and so helpless. Thanks for reading this, I don't think I phrased things that well.

I wasn't super torn up about the breakup (only a 6 month relationship), but it was nice hanging with my friends, drinking, hiking, cooking, etc. 

Over the course of this time, I was becoming more and more attracted to my friend E which culminated in us having sex. We decided to keep it casual and not tell S since we did not think she would take it well. 

We kept hanging out, the three of us, for about a month with me and E also hooking up in secret. Over the course of the hookups, mutual feelings developed, and E and I agreed to be exclusive. Eventually S got wise to me and E making excuses to see each other and asked E if anything was going on. When E admitting to the relationship, S flipped out, yelled at E, and proceeded to ignore both of us. We kept trying to invite her places with our larger friend group and ask if she wanted to talk about it, but she maintained that there was nothing to talk about. 

About two weeks into giving us the cold shoulder, S finally agreed to talk to E. E and I were happy and thought maybe she was willing to be friends with us again.

S claims we were both just lonely and got together because it was easy. S also said we were being selfish and not thinking about her or being there for her. S said she will not hang out with us and accused me of using her to get to E. This is crazy as I considered S and E two of my best friends. When E said the relationship made her happy, S laughed it off. 

E is understandably rattled, and I haven't spoken to S since she spoke to E. E and I are currently very happy together. Neither of us think dating is a mistake. Did we do the right thing or does S have a point albeit taken a little far? Should I talk to S? We want to be friends with S and miss hanging out.

However, her most recent boyfriend is one of the worst she's had. He's 30 and just had a child with his previous girlfriend (they broke up while she was still pregnant) and began dating my sister when the baby was born.

Getting to the why we don't like him: everyone in my family is very outgoing and we spend a lot of time socializing and hanging out together when we're all home. We dance and sing and just have a great time. This guy just sits there. He doesn't talk to anyone, doesn't ask anyone questions, gives one word answers, won't dance with my sister when we go out and have drinks, etc. He's just... boring. It's like he doesn't try to be interested in the family. I've only been around him twice (I live out of state) and both times I've tried asking him questions and such. I told my sister I think it's lame he doesn't talk or anything and she defended him- that's just the way he is.

Should we say something? Or is it really none of anyone's business, sort of a if he makes her happy, so what? thing?

29083,Non-Romantic,396pai,"Ok so I met this woman around November of last year. I have a rocky relationship and a 3 year old son and she is divorced and has 2 boys, 12 and 14.

So we're going to call her Sen. Sen is from Macedonia which she believes is the only good country on the planet. We live in Canada. I am not judgmental about people nor do I take offense when people complain about Canadians while living here, etc. I feel like it's a big difference to where they're from and it must be uncomfortable for people to get used to how we live here. Anyways - she is constantly calling people 'stupid Canadians' and telling me she's going to make my son Macedonian. At first that kind of commentary was kind of funny or cute or whatever but now it's becoming insulting.

She has started seeing this guy we met at a club on my birthday. He made racist jokes all night and made fun of her weight but for whatever reason she decided to see him anyways. She likes to take control of situations and has apparently blown his mind in the bedroom. Except he may be autistic because he -has no friends - only talks about boats -has no social grace, etc. She is constantly asking me to decipher his Canadian ways and tell her what he's REALLY thinking.... even though I've only met the guy one time and I told her I didn't like him.

Now she's talking about her court cases again (She has 3 or 4 going right now). She has chosen to NOT have an interpreter for the majority of the goings on so there has been a lot of miscommunication and I believe she's going to end up being about 100k in debt from court costs - but anyways - she's suing a school board because something fell on her son's head in the school and he has suffered brain damage and will be slow for the rest of his life. She was expecting a 2 million dollar pay out but she got the offer today and it was 40k. So now she's freaking out. 

She ALWAYS wants me over at her house so her parents can take care of my son so she can have me talk to her about everything going on in her life. If I ever bring up something from mine her eyes glaze over and she just changes the subject back to her. I also know she must talk badly about me to her other friends because she speaks badly about her other friends to me. I am just so tired of it being Sen Sen Sen all the time. I don't like talking about men 24/7. I don't like talking about sex 24/7. I don't like leaving my son with her parents so she can indulge in self-importance. My son is only 3 - this is the time I get to spend with him. After he's school age he won't want to hang out with me anymore.

She is a smart woman and I wouldn't mind hanging out with her sometimes but she asks way too much of me and I don't know how to phrase it without offending her. I know you're probably thinking offending her should be the least of my worries but I don't see any reason to hurt her feelings just because she's not my cup of tea.

So.... yeah. Any advice on how to start the conversation? I want to set boundaries and also tell her I don't like when she insults our country.

Okay, so let me start off by saying my older sister has never been very mature, but she's always been fun to be around even if she hasn't been the best role model. 


Last February, she seemed to really be changing for the better. She started working out, seeing a therapist, broke up with her abusive boyfriend, and was all around starting to take better care of herself. We were thrilled. She and I have never been very close because we're polar opposites when it comes to personality (I'm outgoing/outspoken, she's painfully shy/insecure), but we finally began forming an adult relationship and I was so happy to have the kind of older sister I could look up to.


Two months later she meets this guy, Jerry, and things go down hill. FAST. She starts pulling away from the family, claiming she's a black sheep and we don't understand her like he does. She starts picking fights over the tiniest things, stops working out, stops seeing her therapist, and stops putting any effort into anything but him.


One of the things that really set this all into motion (I think) was that my mom had booked a beach house vacation for everyone and asked for just family. My sister threw a huge fit, screaming and crying, asking why our older sister's husband (of 7 years) was allowed to go but not her new boyfriend. My parents tried to be as understanding as possible, and handled it as best they could, but I think she go it into her head that they left him out on purpose. Keep in mind, my younger sister and I also had boyfriends who weren't allowed to come. (Also, my parents had paid for the house *and* her plane ticket, because she had told them she couldn't afford to come otherwise)


In the past year things have only gotten worse. There have been a couple of instances I'd like to highlight specifically:


* The first time we met him, we all went out for a trip to the lake. I tried paddle boarding for the first time, but ended up falling and injuring my hand. I started crying, and he asked to see it. I showed him my hand, which was already swelling and bleeding, which he took into his and proceeded to smack it pretty forcefully. Then he and my sister started cackling, while I began to sob and my dad took me to the ER. He did not apologize even after finding out it had been severely sprained.


* When my mom and little sister stayed with them overnight, he walked into the guest room without knocking while my mom was changing and wearing just a bra and underwear. She was startled and asked him to leave, but he said it wasn't a big deal because she was basically in a bathing suit. He then hugged her, and left the room. 


* While my sister [20] went to stay with them, she witnessed him yelling inappropriate things at women jogging while they were driving to a restaurant, and when they returned to my older sister's apartment, Jerry tried to bully my younger sister into smoking weed with him. 


* When my pregnant older sister met them at a Christmas party, he stood over her and wouldn't move until she got up to give him a hug.


* At the same party, he drank 6-8 beers in about 2 hours and then decided they needed to leave to drive back home. He was adamant that only *he* could drive them home, even with my mom and uncle encouraging my sister to drive instead (my dad wasn't there at the time).


* He met my best friend of 20 years for 30 minutes, and then proceeded to speculate that he was on drugs and a junky because he went to the bathroom twice between us going to lunch and us leaving the restaurant. 


* When my sister had her baby, he *refused* to sit to hold the child, insisting he was fine and accusing us of thinking he was too stupid not to drop him.


* I went to visit my sister, and before I left he insisted on hugging me. I tried to be friendly, and went in for a hug. He then proceeded to squeeze and shake me. I told him over and over that he was making me uncomfortable, but he wouldn't put me down. He took a long, noisy whiff of my hair before I finally shoved myself away from him, and he started laughing at my obvious discomfort. I looked to my sister for support, and instead she told me that his hobby was to go up to strangers and sniff their hair and then challenge them if they acted uncomfortable. 

* He got into a huge row with my aunt about vaccines, and how bad they are and unnecessary. My sister just sat there and twiddled her thumbs. (Keep in mind, my dad used to make vaccines)


* When my sister came to visit us the **one** time this year, he called her in a panic about how his brother was dead from a construction accident. Then it turned into his brother's friend was dead, and his brother was going to lose his legs. Then it was his brother's legs were just broken. Then it was his brother was totally fine and was being discharged from the hospital. This all occurred in the span of 24 hours she was with us.


There's so much more, but I could go on forever and I don't really think it's necessary. He lies about everything, then changes his stories, then when he's caught he gets insanely defensive. 

My sister refuses to talk about it, even when we've tried to approach her about these issues calmly and rationally. She instead sees the fault in us, claiming we're elitist and trying to take away her one true love.

She has made it clear in the last month that if we do not accept him, we do not accept her, and that she is willing to cut all contact with us to preserve her relationship with him.

At this point, I have lost all respect for my sister. She has always been immature, but in the past year she has turned into a manipulative bully. My parents have tried talking to her, they exchanged emails because she refuses to talk on the phone, but she won't hear a single negative word about him. She keeps attacking my parents like it's *their* fault. She refuses to respond to their emails now, but continues to send hurtful, malicious emails to them.

Is there any way to save this relationship without completely ostracizing her?

She instead has opted to cut off any communication between the family and herself.

Just for a little bit of background, both of my Dad's parents died when they were in their mid to late 50's. They both died of cancer (my grandmother died of gullbladder cancer, my grandfather died of colon cancer). It was obviously devastating that they died but I was pretty young when my grandfather died so I only remember the impact of my grandmother on my Dad. 


My Dad is one of those man's man type of fella (honestly, he reminds me exactly of Ron Swanson). Those ones that were born before the health conscious efforts of the world when you could by a pack of smokes at the age of 10 if you said your mom sent you. My dad has been smoking pretty much since that age and smokes about a pack a day. He eats a lot of junk food and likes to make jokes about how pizza has every food group! and bacon and eggers ARE healthy for you. The only time I remember him going to the doctor is a few years ago when he got hit ion the eye with a baseball during a game and the ladies on the team MADE him go get stitches. 


I love my Dad to death, he has been there through everything with me, supported me when my mom abandoned me, and would do anything for myself and my siblings (2 sisters, 1 brother). I thought that I could lead by example and in the past few years I have quit smoking and eating healthy, losing weight, staying active and going for regular checkups. But it is not motivating him at all and I don't know what to do anymore. 


When he turned 50 I had a serious talk with him that basically went like this; *Dad, I love you more than anything, and now that you are getting in to your 50's I really do want you to start keeping an eye on your health a bit more. Both of your parents died at very young ages and I can't stand to see you go that early* He pretty much just shrugged it off and said he was going to be fine... 


I bring up going to the doctor's once in a while and he doesn't listen at all. My younger sister was diagnosed with arthritis in her back and the doctor said that in order for some of the pain to go away she would HAVE to lose weight. I thought that seeing that would have an effect on my Dad to be more aware but I don't see it yet. My Dad is also overweight and constantly complains about sore knees, sore back, etc. 


Is there anything I can do to convince him? I'm starting to get frustrated and scared. I love my Dad to death and I can't stand losing him before he's even retired or before he can even walk me down the aisle.

Well, tonight my own forgetfulness, among other things got me into trouble with one of the few budding friendships I have. I feel this is a stupid conflict (on all sides), and feel equally stupid writing for emotional advice, but here we go.


The friend at the center of this issue, Alex, has spent two weekends in the past in our home, always on her way to visit another friend in town, or to attend an event. She lives four hours away in another city, and while staying with us continually mentions all of her other friends in our area to the point where it is somewhat noticeable. She is otherwise a decent house guest, other than openly commenting upon the swift of dog hair under my coffee table as though it was a dead rat. Other than that, she is usually an unobtrusive guest in our very small home. Last month I canceled on a hastily made plan to visit her, I hazily remember casually rescheduling for sometime next month around the same time. Noting that I was the one who was driving to visit her. On Tuesday, I had received a generic text message consisting of Can we go out on the boat this weekend? Noticing that I had neglected to respond to a number of texts from Alex over the past week, I responded Sure!! and thought nothing of it. I figured she was visiting another friend over the weekend and wanted to stop by for a few hours. I noticed a missed call yesterday, but again, was busy and exhausted and figured I would call her back over the weekend.     
  

That was until I received a call at 10 P.M. tonight in which Alex informed me that she had been on the road since 6 P.M. and was on her way and about an hour out. I was, obviously not expecting her. I have a full weekend, my mother is coming to visit, and my husband is working 14 hour shifts. This is not a good weekend for us to have company at all. At the time, I had just gotten off of work myself and was so very excited to imitate bumps on logs with my husband while watching the final season of Full Metal Alchemist, BH, together before he slaves away for three days. I panicked, and lied, which I rarely do. I told her we were out of town for the night, visiting my husbands ill mother (that part was true, she is ill, and we visit often). She freaked, predictably, and I did feel like a sack of dog doo for it. I apologized for forgetting (I truly don't remember planning this), and told her to call me back if she could not find a place to stay and we would turn around and come home. I thought finding another place to sleep would be no trouble, with all of her other friends in the area, and seeing as how she was in town to visit me, but also to attend another friends birthday party.


I talked to my husband, who was no more enthused at having company than I was, he declared us both ditsy, and we mutually  decided to let her find another place for the night and she would stay with us tomorrow. I felt bad for a few hours, but then I was a bit mad at her. I would never drive to visit a friend (over 200 miles away!) without rock solid conformation that they were prepared for me to begin with, have previously let them know my itinerary, and then I would send a Hey, I'm leaving, see you soon. message, and keep them posted as to my progress on my drive. I had no idea she was even coming until 10:10 P.M.. 


A good friend would have welcomed her and had a great night, I know I was not the best of friends, in all honestly, the need for my own time overrode our friendship at that moment. Then I called her back to make sure she had found a place. She had, with an old roommate. I profusely apologized like a rag, and got the nastiest Ill talk to you in the morning. line and realized that I should not have, this was a mutual mistake and she is the type to run with an admission of guilt. I should have clarified the text message she sent me on Tuesday, and not blindly responded, but she should have made sure I was still up for this weekend and aware that she was planning to stay at my house for three days. I just needed to get this negativity off of my chest, honestly, but I welcome any advice on how to move forward. I have already decided that I will be spending tomorrow with my mother as planned, and that she can wait until afterwards. Being completely honest, I do value her friendship, and would hate to lose what we have, it was simply truly terrible timing.

She started commenting on my sister [14f] and I's weight. We're both pretty slender, but recently she's been telling us that our thighs are getting big. Sometimes she'll mention how thick I am to my sister.

I'm not really worried about my mom fat-shaming me, but more worried about my sister. When I was her age, I was severely depressed and had no one to talk to (Especially not my mom). I was also suicidal, but I got through it. My sister's very sensitive and I worry she'll enter that path of depression and suicidal/tendencies. My sister's a dancer and she can't afford to start worrying about her weight. She's already very skinny, but when the doc said she was 5'2 and 106 pounds, my mom commented on how chubby she had gotten. My mother is very controlling as well, so even if you try to tell her that the things she says aren't nice things to say, she'll automatically call you names and denounce anything you said.

Then there's rationing food. We're only allowed to eat bread and peanut butter. We eat the same shitty meal for dinner. I'm not allowed to cook because my mom thinks I'm a waster. The other day she yelled at us for finishing a case of water she bought in 4 days. It didn't matter that we told her it's hot outside and on top of that, have to walk to the metro to get to work and/or dance. So to teach us a lesson, she stopped buying water and told us we'd just have to boil water on the kettle and drink it. My sister can't take a hint when it comes to rousing up my mom's emotions, so she goes telling her that water is needed for survival and my mom says, So go buy water with your own money if you want it so bad, and since my mom hates me for being like my father, it always comes back to bite me in the ass. Because I get 7 hours of yelling for being a disrespectful child. She was just mad that I drank the last bottle before she could save it for herself.
In other words, what should we say to her whenever she publicly shames someone for being fat and/or fat-shames us? The rationing food thing has been a thing for a decade, that can't change.

Last summer, I was brand new to the whole dating scene. Never even kissed a girl before. Finally, around July last year, I met a girl, J, and we dated for a month. I got attached to her almost immediately, but J was only interested in casual dating. Eventually, she ended things saying that she didn't have the time or ability to maintain a relationship, though she wanted to stay friends. So we did. I asked her every so often if she'd change her mind, but always got turned down. 

Some time in December, she started a relationship with M, another guy she dated over the summer. When I found out, I asked her why she wanted a relationship with M, but not with me. She said that she and M are not serious whereas she and I would be. I actually do believe her because 1) M is leaving in a few months and 2) they don't spend much time together (she would actually spend more time with me). 

I was pissed off and crushed, but I held on to our friendship until last week, when another girl (S) I had been dating since around October left because I refused to be official with her. I thought that maybe if I didn't spend so much time with J, I would have gotten over her and fell for S. After a couple days, I told J that we can't be friends anymore.

*He’s completely self-obsessed.  A conversation with him generally consists of just listening to him talk.  I have brought this up-to him previously so now he will ask me how I am etc. but when I answer I can see he’s not listening or doesn’t care.  He doesn’t ask you anything specific and never follows anything up.  For example, I have told him a few times how I’m not sure about my job and whether I am happy there.  He never follows that up, never asks how I’m finding it. The conversation resets and we end up just going through the motions of him having to ask me how I am and me having to sit through telling someone who doesn’t actually care.  At this stage I’m pretty fed up with it and give him the bare minimum which is something he’s now throwing back in my face.

*He has, for years now, insinuated or acted like his parents died and none of it happened to me.  He acts like because I have my shit together I’ve been totally unaffected by the whole thing.  It doesn’t matter how many times I tell him all the way’s in which it’s affected me; he doesn’t hear it.

*Added to all this he treats me pretty badly, I am always met with anger and hate when he doesn’t get what he wants.  He completely fails to see that I wasn’t put on this earth to serve him.  


**Current situation:**
We had a bit of a fight through text messages recently and we both agreed that we need to meet and discuss some of the issues we both have. On reflection, this might not have been the best idea and I have some concerns about this meeting. 


I have done plenty of reading about narcissism but I am not a professional so it’s possible I’m barking up the wrong tree completely there.  If I am right though, confronting a narcissist about there behaviour is difficult.  He will likely turn everything back on me and make me the problem, which he has done countless times before. I am prepared for this but I’m worried that I am not strong enough but also that confronting him is the wrong thing to do. What if I undo some of the work his therapist is doing?  


It’s been suggested to me that I just cut him off but that’s not an option right now.  We are tied together financially until I reach 30 and receive my half of the inheritance our parents left us.   Aside from that though, I can’t cut him off.  He’s my baby brother and I love him.  I don’t want to lose him too so I need to find a way that we can exist without constant hurt and fighting.


I guess Reddit, I need some outside perspective, what can I do?  Has anyone been through something similar?

29163,Non-Romantic,1uah6g,"I'll try to keep this short, but I want to give enough detail to fully explain the situation. 

I have been living with my boyfriend for a little over a year now, and during nearly the entire time (maybe give a few weeks) his sister has lived with us. My boyfriend and I were in a LDR for 4 years and I was finally able to move to his city last year. 

Now when I moved, I knew his sister wanted to come live with us (she had been staying with him a lot ) and I agreed to it thinking she would benefit from living with some younger folks. She had been living with her mother and although her mom is supportive, she didn't seem to be in a good mental state when she lived with her. 

She has a lot of mental issues. Clinical depression, anxiety, and agoraphobia. Most of it stems from her being overweight, as well as a hormone disorder. She does not have a job, because of these issues.

So naturally I was very sympathetic to her conditions, and willing to let her stay and try to get some help. 

When she first moved in, it wasn't so bad. She was helpful around the house, and helped a little financially. 

She was seeking to find a new therapist in our area, and working on getting any extra health care she needed, so it seemed like she would be able to get the help she needed and become more independent.

Now very rapidly all this started to go downhill. She stopped looking for mental help, stopped cleaning, and relies on me and my boyfriend for everything. She cannot drive because her license expired and every time I mention getting a new one she has some excuse.

She is fully capable of doing many things herself, yet doesn't until I harass her to. 

She pays for some food that is for everyone yet it disappears so fast i have to go grocery shopping basically every week. Even if I buy something for myself, and tell her that it's mine, most or all of it will go missing.

She is incredibly lazy, to the point if one of our cats poops outside her door, she will not see it and waits for me to pick it up. She won't even answer the door to get a pizza (which she orders a lot of) and guilts me into doing it.

Her hygiene is awful, her room is full to the brim with trash and old food. The smell in there is terrible.  At one point she had almost every single one of our dishes in there and I had to tell her to clean them so we could have dishes to use. 

I feel as though instead of being nice, I am being manipulated. If I kick her out, she has somewhere to go but I KNOW her mother is going to call us and beg to take her back because she doesn't know what to do with her. She will be hurt and cry if I do it, but i'm at my wits end. I'm a relatively clean person so seeing someone in my living space be so filthy, and not pick up after themselves drives me crazy. I have some anxiety myself, so I get little fits of rage and crazyness. 

I hate having to take care of her like she is a child. I also slightly resent that she makes money (from the government) by sitting on her ass all day, while I have a full time job that i'm exhausted from, and of course the first thing she says to me when I get home is What's for dinner. Not to mention I have to clean the house when she is home all day long, and uses the excuse that since she hibernates in her room that she shouldn't have to clean anything else (but she doesn't even clean her damn room).

I'm nice because every time I want to be mean I feel guilty for all the issues she has. Yet at the same time I feel like she is using her issues to her advantage so that someone (either us or her mother) will take care of her. 

She says she will do things (go to school, better herself, etc.) yet she will give up after very feeble attempts. 

My boyfriend is on board with kicking her out (he has dealt with her before and says this always happens) yet he wants me to feel okay with it before he does anything like issue an ultimatum. He works like crazy, so basically if I weren't here he thinks she would have went back to her mom's by now. 

So i guess i'm looking for outside opinions, would kicking her out be too harsh? Or does she need it to get her life together?

**TLDR:** I want to kick out my boyfriend's sister who has been living with us for over a year because she is lazy and messy but feel guilty because she has mental and health issues.  

**Edit** Thanks for the replies! I think i've calmed down enough to be willing to give her a second chance, on the conditions she starts cleaning her room, helping with the house, and trying to take steps to be more independent. I think the hardest part for me will be enforcing these demands since I dislike conflict and tend to be a bit of a push over, but luckily my boyfriend is on my side 100% so he can help me stick to it.

My one-bedroom 700sqft apartment happens to be close to their house, and I live on my own. (Marginally relevant: my girlfriend spends quite a bit of time with me there.)

I’m not sure of the details, but it sounds like they’ve been strained for many years. He says they’ve sought marriage counseling a few times but it was fruitless. Now, he tells me, they are both threatening divorce.

He’s asked if he can stay at my apartment if shit hits the fan and she won’t move out.

They helped me out by giving me a room at their house when I first moved to the area, and, well, he’s family, so I want to help if I can. It would considerably disrupt my life, but it should only be temporary while he looks for an apartment of his own.

My bigger concern is how this might affect the broader familial relationships. If I let him crash at my place, will my aunt feel like I’m “taking his side”? Perhaps a family rift is unavoidable? Is there anything I can or should do to help them try to patch things up and maybe even stay together, or should I avoid interference? I’ve only really heard his side of the story, should I seek out hers, or would that just piss everyone off and put me (an unqualified individual) in the middle of the crossfire?

Having been through a divorce myself, I know how emotionally charged everything can be. I believe that it’s a family’s duty to help each other when possible - but I don’t want to make things messier or worse. His family has been an emotional anchor for our extended family for decades and it pains me to see it in trouble. I just want to do what’s best for everyone involved.

29210,Non-Romantic,2tzu9d,"Hi r/Relationships. This is a throwaway account as it is a very personal topic and I don't want it to be connected to a main account.

I have a friend (19/F) who has been a known drug user. We will call her Bree. I have known Bree about 5 months now. Bree has been doing drugs all through high school and now into college. She also drinks heavily especially on special occasions despite being underage. Normally this sort of thing doesn't bother me, if it is kept in moderation, but this has gotten to levels that are concerning.

Bree gets extremely drunk very often. Any time there is alcohol involved, at an event or just with friends, she takes it too far. This leads to blacking out or puking almost every time. So far our friend group has just laughed off the drinking and pretty much ignored it. They all like to drink a bit also and don't see it as a problem.

Bree also takes lots of prescription pills. Things like addreall, Vicodin, and various others. This has started to get to an abusive level especially since none of the pills are hers. Something like 10-15 Vicodin since this Saturday. While we haven't all hung out and had any alcohol I can't help but wonder if she is drinking by herself on these pills or if she has been on the pills during parties in the past. If anything it is worrying that she is getting prescription pills that aren't hers.

I have confronted a friend (not Bree) in the past about their drug use and was able to get them help. The problem here is that Bree doesn't see her drug use as a problem. She blatantly talks and laughs about how much she drinks and does drugs and has no regard for what might happen. She has been to rehab already (in high school) and brags about how she was able to do drugs while in a rehab program. Her parents don't see it as a problem and just seem to ignore anything suspicious that comes up. Our friend group also doesn't seem to care and has the attitude of She's not hurting anyone so just ignore it. There is zero support for any sort of intervention from anyone around us. 

This has been getting progressively more extreme, it seems, throughout the year. I have no clue what to do, if I should even do anything, and am really worried that if nothing is done we will have the friend on the 11 o'clock news who somehow OD'd. Bree and I aren't the closest in our group of friends but I really want to know if I should do something and what I even can do.

It all started with Brandon very obviously ditching me after a party to go home with her.  We had set plans to share a cab. When I sit with them in a big group they are texting each other from across the room. Sheila's desk is next to mine, and they gchat all day. There have been instances when I know she is telling him things I have said. He repeatedly makes a huge effort to hide his phone when he is texting her, and it completely halts our conversations. I am constantly being lied to as they try to cover up their involvement, and as such I can't trust either of them anymore. I am having difficultly interacting with them on a daily basis because they act weird around each other. She has her flirty girl persona dialed way up and he has his cool guy attitude turned on. Neither of those personas I would be friends with, and they belittle me to impress each other. I am not the only one who has had issues with their office interactions in the past and they are worse now. (I am moving offices soon, no worries.)


My concern is that at some point I considered these people remarkably good friends. Especially Brandon. And now I am incredibly uncomfortable.


They are both leaving in 3 months, so I doubt they are in this for the long haul. I think I would be feel better if I thought they were legitimately dating - even though I see nothing wrong with FWB in principle. And I get that they may not even know what their relationship is, much less want to publicize it. And it's not especially my business.


So now I need advice on what to do, or not to do. There have been days when my response is to ignore them passive aggressively and other days when I try to just push past it and make myself comfortable in their presence. Sheila invited Brandon and I and a couple other friends on a weekend retreat a while ago, and now I am being noncommittal about going because know I cannot handle them for a whole weekend. I kind of just want them to know that I know at this point so I can stop being lied to.


Our workplace is not the type of place that really cares about dating in the office.

29275,Non-Romantic,36unus,"So I found out tonight that my sister has been dating a 36 year old male co-worker since about November.

Some background, my family was all raised super religious Christian conservative, our parents of course want each of us to follow a certain path - get a job, get married, have kids, go to church.  The oldest 3 (of 7) of us have not really followed that path but have our lives on track and are dating people within our age range.  

My sister, 22 and fifth child, Jenny, recently moved out from our parents house (still living in the same town) and heavily involved in church, etc.  She has been working for a family friend and goes out of town on work trips rather frequently.

Jenny and her co-worker (36M), Fred, met when she was 17. Fred also goes on these work trips with her and they started hooking up in November (according to my sister).  He also took her virginity so of course, now, she is super attached to him.

A couple of red flags with the relationship (beside the fact this dude is still married).  They don't use condoms when having sex, Jenny is not on the pill, and Fred has told Jenny that he wants to get her pregnant so their relationship would be easier.   Apparently they even talked about getting married as well.  They also only ever hang out on these work trips, so of course this is exciting and thrilling for both of them... but neither of them knows how the other is in regular every day life.

This all came as a shock when she told us this and only spit out details here and there about their relationship.  Jenny has a very close relationship with my other sister, Alice (24 and fourth child), who is currently in Alaska in the army.  Alice is doing the same thing up there (dating a divorcee with a child) and they have been bonding together over it.  Neither of them is the brightest tool in the shed, but we would expect they would have a little more common sense over this.

We (me and my two older sisters) are mostly worried for Jenny because she is still young and has a bright future and is very good looking and could get any guy she wanted.  We don't want her to ruin her life by getting pregnant with this guy.

Reddit, I need your help here.  What do we do?  We need to vent our concerns to her and help her see she's making a mistake but we also don't want her to shut down and alienate us and for her to think we're just bringing her down.   We also cannot tell our parents because they would flip and would handle it completely wrong and further cement her on her path.  Also, Jenny is bonding with her sister Alice over this same thing.  We can't really do anything with Alice since she's so far away... if somehow we can get her on board with telling Jenny that she's making a mistake instead of approving this whole thing that would also help.

About my situation: I'm a student and I want to spend the next semester abroad. I don't want to take money from my parents or anyone for that so I'm currently working and will be for the rest of the summer break until I have to go. This means I'll have enough money to go on etc...

Now my mother informed me that my gran wants to donate some of the leftover money from my (now deceased pa) to me and my siblings. I was very touched but also really uncomfortable. My granma has health issues and is really fragile, quite literally: she broke a bone by just tripping on the ground. So the idea of taking money from her when she could use it to treat herself and get better is torturing me.

I've been told that she has made the decision and seen a lawyer to do all this right.

The thing is I thought I could try to call her on Mother's Day. When I tried to talk about this, I began to splutter and really mixed all I wanted to say - that I was grateful, that this was making me nervous - into a big mess that she didn't really understand (she has bad hearing).

29290,Non-Romantic,27majr,"**Update** - Sat my mom and my sister down and told them that if what happened earlier happens again I am calling the police. My sister yelled at me for a bit, telling me it's all my fault and that I should stop talking to her or about her to our mom. I stayed calm and didn't engage and just told her this was her warning but she doesn't seem to be taking it seriously and said I'll stop when you stop but it'll be all on her if she does it again and I'll be sure to record it too.

So my sister and I have grown up together in a dysfunctional low/middle class household with our abusive, alcoholic father, enabler mother and our 3 younger siblings. We both have problems because of the way we were raised and I'm worried about how it's affected my sister.

I've been off at college for the past 2 years so I've mostly been away from home and I've only been back for the summer months because of financial reasons and this summer, I've found it increasingly difficult to deal with my sister 17F who I will call 'E'.

E and I have never been very close since we were young, it was pretty clear our whole lives that we were going to be very different people with completely different interests. She is very obsessive with her looks, constantly doing her hair, begging mom to get her expensive makeup, spends money as soon as she gets it and changing outfits at least 3 times a day while I'm more artistic and do freelance design artwork, dress comfortably and tend to save my money for big things like college and holidays. We've always had lots of sisterly problems, she would borrow my stuff and steal my hard earned money out of my room until I finally got the key to my room and had to lock it every time I left. But she's recently gotten very violent and screams at me over numerous things.

One of these times recently, I was in my room on my laptop in my room and I heard her on the phone, she was speaking really loud in what sounded like an angry tone and I just assumed she was fighting with her boyfriend on the phone. She barely ate any of her dinner that night and my mom was worried so I told my mom I thought I heard her fighting on the phone so she might just be upset. The next thing I hear is OP! What the FUUUUUUUUUUUCK?! as she runs down the stairs and comes running right for me. Why the fuck do you keep talking about me all the time, you're such a stalker OP, I wasn't fighting, stop making shit up about me She says this, literally screaming at me. So I explain that I'm sorry, it just sounded like she was fighting on the phone and we were worried when she didn't eat her dinner. She proceeds to kick me in the leg and scream some more, calling me fat bitch and stalker some more. My mom was in the same room as this happened, and she basically just told E to stop it and not use that kind of language etc but that was it.  

After that incident, I spoke to my mom about it, saying I really didn't appreciate being treated like that, and that I thought my sister could do with some counselling and that I was even planning on going when I go back to college in September to help me deal with a lot of the problems caused by growing up in this abusive environment. My mom thinks I'm being ridiculous and says I'm getting a degree in Art, not Psychology so I have no right to say whether my sister needs counselling. And she insisted that my sister would just freak out if we mentioned it and my mom said  she values her peace and quiet and my mom got mad when I said it was worrying that she cares more about her peace and quiet than he daughter's mental health. (I also thought that *if* she was to get help, surely there would be more quiet and less violent outbursts.. &gt;_&gt;)

So I've stopped trying to help my sister but she still keeps acting very hurtful towards me. She got called down to do the dishes yesterday and as I slowly passed her while going upstairs, carefully staring down at my mug of tea, making sure not to spill it on the carpet she said I hate you, you fat bitch And it really hurts my feeling and breaks down my already fragile self esteem, I have been overweight for the past few years and I decided last month to change that, I've been making changes to my diet and I go jogging daily and I've been working really hard. An hour ago she came down to yell at my mom when my mom asked her to bring down the laptop and I asked her to cut it out, she spits in my face and proceeds to kick and punch me and scream at me to stay out of it and repeatedly call me a stalker again (I dunno what she thinks qualifies as a stalker). 

I have tried to bond and help my sister, especially over the shared abuse we have experienced,I really really wanted us to be close and show her that she does have a loving sister she can rely on if she ever needs me but every time I try to show concern and want to help her she shuts me down and explodes. So I gave that up a long time ago.

So, I know she really doesn't want anything to do with me, and my mom doesn't want to help or talk to her in any way so I just would like some advice on how to deal with her confrontations, any ways I could convince my mom to maybe consider offering her an opportunity to go to counselling? I dunno, I was originally more worried about having to deal with my Dad over the holidays but it seems she has taken his place... And I'm stuck here for the next 2 months so I just want a little help in dealing with this.

29291,Non-Romantic,2wcbzl,"We've been friends since we were kids; they were my next door neighbors for awhile and we went to the same schools. Let's call them Max (26) and Zac (24.)

Max and Zac came from a broken druggie family and ended up in the care of the state in their teens. They ran away from foster care and lived as homeless couch surfers together for a few years. They both had minor trouble with drugs and the law at that age, but with the help of the nicest lady we'll ever know they got their lives together, found work and have since tried to be independent and hardworking people. Max and Zac have a very close relationship; they often had no one else to rely on but each other. 

They both have struggled in the past with finding and keeping jobs. One of them has lived with me while unemployed for an extended period of time, and the other has borrowed a few thousand from me over the years that I won't see anytime soon. Because of this financial ineptitude, they've spent the majority of their adult lives as bachelor roommates, in a cycle of poverty they can't seem to break. 

For a long while, Max had a job that paid ok. It was physically very demanding. He wasn't getting paid nearly what he was worth, but he couldn't earn as much doing anything else. During that time, he was supporting his brother Zac, who was unemployed and didn't try very hard to find work. Max barely made ends meet, having to constantly ask for help making his rent and paying exorbitant interest on payday loans just to keep his apartment. Max held a lot of resentment towards Zac over his unwillingness to help their situation, and it often led to crazy fighting. 

Then the roles did a complete 180; Zac made the right friend and broke into a good career with good pay and good job security. He agreed to stay with his brother for another year so Max could get out of debt and stabilize financially. Then Max lost his job, realized he can't find another one that pays a wage he can live on, got really depressed and experienced some sort of existential crisis. He is currently pulling in unemployment that doesn't quite cover his half of the rent/bills and is not attempting to find work. 

Zac is angry at Max because he isn't earning any money, thus preventing Zac from saving more money for himself and moving out on his own. It's sort of hypocritical since Zac basically did the same thing to Max for so long, but at the same time the frustration with Max's unwillingness to find work is completely understandable. 

Max is angry at Zac because while Max was the one supporting them, Zac really didn't do anything. Max had to scrimp and take loans and borrow money from friends for years to make up whatever Zac didn't, and Zac will do none of these things now. Zac probably has the money on hand even to cover what Max can't, but he is extremely begrudging about paying for Max's half and treats Max worse than Max treated him when the roles were reversed (especially concerning things like food and cigarettes.)  

I see these guys several times a week even though we live on opposite sides of town. They're more like family than my own family, and unless I want to change that relationship I can't do anything to avoid getting caught up in their personal drama. They generally don't try and pull me into it officially, but when I'm alone with either of them they try hard to get me to agree that they're in the right while the other needs to change. 

I've been doing this walking on eggshells thing for years, on and off, whenever they quit getting along. I tell people I'm used to it but it bothers me more and more. I have helped them in every way I know how. Their fighting regularly and being so negative has really started affecting my daily attitude and the way I see the world. It's so frustrating to do everything you can think of for people who you care a lot about, and see no real improvement or change in their lives. 

What do I need to change about my behavior or the way I approach these situations to be more effective at getting them to stop fighting and start changing their lives?

29309,Non-Romantic,2rizcf,"My husband and I have been friends with Ayotunde*, since we were all in high school together. He is an incredibly intelligent, down-to-earth person, currently working towards his PhD in a field he loves. He was in a relationship with his boyfriend for approximately three years before he called it quits. The relationship was toxic beyond belief. The boyfriend abused cocaine and other drugs, had relations with other people behind Ayotunde’s back (eventually Ayotunde found out about all of them at once… I think this was the breaking point,) stole money and managed to trash their place several times after having parties Ayotunde did not know about. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Needless to say, this relationship was not good for Ayotunde’s demeanour. For about a month after the breakup, he was really down in the dumps – preferred staying home, was kind of neglecting school and his appearance (he is huge about going to the gym at least four times a week.)


After that initial month, it was as if he flipped a light switch and did a complete 180. First, he downloaded all the possible dating apps known to man. He signed up for OkC, PoF, etc. The beginning was fine, because we figured he was just trying to force himself back into “the game.” Maybe a breakup coping mechanism? In any case, we supported him. We went barhopping with him several times even (we are not the barhopping type; this was huge for both of us.) In almost every instance, my husband and I would end up heading home together, having lost track of Ayotunde. He’d text us later on, confirming his location. Most times, he’d end up at a stranger’s house – someone he’d met at the bar. 


Knowing him, this all seemed strange. He is definitely the definition of a homebody, someone who prefers the company of his cat and books. Then all of a sudden, he became impossible to reach. He was partying literally every night, his degree began to suffer (I imagine, because he was never in class – confirmed by a friend he goes to school with) and he stopped answering his phone/text messages. We had been unable to reach him for three days straight when I decided to go to his apartment in broad daylight, knowing he should be home because he didn't have class at the time or anything. 


The apartment was disgusting. There was garbage everywhere, so many empty bottles of liquor, his clothes strewn all over the place and at least three used condoms on the floor. He had clearly been drinking that day (I was there at around 11 AM) and he smelled. I made us some tea and we sat on his balcony. I expressed my concern about the way he’s been acting and I guess my empathy caused him to spill the beans. He had gotten himself into a few hairy situations, having met up with someone from Craigslist. The man basically forced him to give him oral sex and abandoned him in some empty parking garage. He didn’t know where he was, so he hitchhiked back home with another stranger. This was two months ago. Another instance, he was on a “date” with another random from Craigslist, who basically forced his way into his apartment and essentially, raped him (he refuses to admit it was rape, he doesn't want to label it as such.) This had only happened two weeks prior to my visit. 


The thing is, he is in massive denial. This is part of “the game.” He has to weed through the duds before he finds the right person, and this is his way of doing it. I know he is a grown man, I know I can’t physically stop him from doing what he’s doing, but he’s throwing his future career and life down the toilet. He’s clearly got some residual side effects from his previous relationship, and I don’t know how to fix that. I can’t force him into therapy, can I? My next step was to talk to his mother, essentially tattle on him. I am sure she’s completely unaware of what’s been going on. I’m almost certain he’s been abusing drugs, too.

29333,Non-Romantic,3i5p16,"Background: I am a senior in high school (USA) and I live in a racially homogenous area where 99% of the high school population is white. I am Indian (Asian, not Native American) and the largest minority in the school is from India (probably ~20 students).

Race is a very sensitive issue here and Indians like to claim that they're marginalized by the white population (whether they are is another topic). My high school has a lot of student-run clubs (basically organizations to write on your college resumes), but the two biggest ones are overtly Christian and dominated by whites.

So, to combat this problem, some of my Indian friends registered a club with the school. The purpose of this club is to raise awareness about Indian culture/traditions, etc. However, they automatically assumed that every Indian would want to be apart of this club, so they registered every Indian person in the school as club members. I was unknowingly registered, and now I'm kind of annoyed.

Since race is a sensitive issue, I try to avoid it and blend in with the white community. I've been somewhat successful, but I also have a separate group of Indian friends that I also don't want to leave. However, the truth is that I have no time for this club (I have a paid internship outside of school in a field I'm interested in majoring in).

The real reason deep down inside has to do with race. I don't want to be apart of an organization where all of the members (so far) are Indian. It seems kind of racist to other races to be apart of this club (even though it's billed as an open-for-all races club, but let's face it, only Indians have joined because club leaders have done a piss-poor job of advertising to the student body because they already met the school requirements for creating a club and will now write it on their resumes). Also, since I was born in the US and can only speak English, I don't really want to join this club.

It's very easy to officially de-register myself from the club/leave it, but there are social issues I need to consider. Most importantly, Indian students at my school have a culture of reliance. What I mean is, I am _expected_ to help out other Indians simply because I'm of the same race. Therefore, I am expected to participate in this club because I'm Indian. The mentality is kind of like Indians need to band together for survival. Unfortunately, I know many Indians who don't have real American friends and only hang out with other Indians outside of school. It's not that they hate whites, they just don't really connect with them. So it's like a lack of understanding. I myself am trying to overcome this issue and meet more white friends (because America is still overwhelmingly white and I realize I can't continue secluding myself when I grow up and go out into society). I do have some close friends who happen to be white. However, a few of my other close friends are Indian and they're the ones who started the club I was talking about. Since we have been quite close for the last few years, they automatically assumed I would want to participate, but I don't because I mostly fear that it's not conducive to me trying to assimilate into American culture.

Now the problem is how to leave the club graciously. Obviously, I could say that I have no time because of my internship. Then, the arguments I anticipate would be that:

1) The meetings won't be that long and won't take too much time out of my day

2) I'm taking fewer/easier classes than my other Indian friends (it's true, but that's because of my internship that I haven't told anyone about...then they would gossip about it because we're all extremely competitive), so why wouldn't I have time to help out?

3) I'm Indian, so it's my _obligation_ to help out. They will ask me why I don't appreciate my culture/heritage.

4) They will offer me a leadership position to write on my college application/resume. I honestly wouldn't write it on there, because I mention nothing about my Indian culture in my essays and my intended major is in engineering. If you didn't see that I checked the Asian box for race, you probably wouldn't even know that I'm not white. Besides, (not to brag) I already have enough to write on my college application/resume. But I haven't told _anyone_ that I won't be emphasizing my Indian heritage on my application. Most of my friends are writing about Indian and American cultural differences; I don't want to tell anyone that I'm not writing about that, because of personal reasons.

I can't bring up race AT ALL. Because this would be very controversial. Some of their parents know my parents, so perhaps word might get to my parents, who are quite progressive and encourage me to get into American culture. Still, it would be awkward. Oh, I would also be (subtly) branded as a racist by my friends. My close Indian friends and I don't usually talk about race in our conversations (usually it's just typical teenager talk), so I would be devastated if they slowly drifted away from me. I would be lonely. Maybe I am truly racist? (I'm kind of insecure and going through a race-related identity crisis too..).

29345,Non-Romantic,1xk680,"Hey guys. I'll try to make this as short as possible.

My best friend (I'll call her Natalie), who I have known for 13 years and is more like my sister, wants to take a trip to Puerto Rico. I would love to go, as I have only been out of the country one time. There's just a few problems: she wants to go with her hookup, who I'll call Ura (~2 months) and his friend.

IMO, I think she's obsessed with him. I know she's excited that something finally happened between them after a year of close friendship (they were coworkers), but she talks about him constantly, clings onto him when they go out, wants to send him something for V-day (she claims it won't be a romantic thing, but more like a friendship thing), etc. I have gotten really annoyed with how she's feeling towards him (I admit, jealousy of losing my best friend) because she has cancelled plans with me to hang out with him. She always wants to hang out with him and his friend. He admitted to having sex with girls all the time before he met his now ex-girlfriend and was sleeping around constantly.

**EDIT: Also, I think her hookup is kind of a sleezeball. He's a nice, funny guy, but he's also really cocky. He's really attractive and admitted to having a girlfriend when they met, but was still meeting up with Natalie several times a week, flirting and drinking heavily, and towards the end of his relationship, admitted to being attracted to her. ALSO, he's been really weird with me. He asked for my number the second time we met because he wanted to give me some information on a job search. Ok, cool, no problem, but I felt weird about having his number. A lot of the times when we go out, he has his arm around my shoulders, my waist, is constantly hugging me and has even a couple times accidentally grazed my butt. This is all right while Natalie is there! Maybe he's just friendly, but sometimes I feel like he's more flirtatious with me and given his past, I just don't trust him. I haven't told Natalie ANY of this or how I think he's sleazy, because it'll hurt her, or she won't believe me, or think I'm jealous. Again, maybe it's innocent fun, but sometimes you get this gut feeling that something more is going on.**

Okay, now onto his friend, who I'll call Victor. This guy was really cool in the beginning and he seemed really nice. One night when the four of us went out, I got PLASTERED on tequila and didn't remember most of the night. Apparently, I asked Victor if he had a girlfriend, and when he said yes, grabbed his crotch!!! I was MORTIFIED. I do NOT have a crush on him and did not like him in any way, at all. He is an attractive guy, tall, can dance, etc but I do not like him! I have no clue why I would do that. Everyone laughed it off, though and he was in no way upset.

Recently, Victor broke up with his girlfriend. He had been slightly more touch feely with me, grinding with me, etc. I was feeling uncomfortable with this because, again, I do not like him. I guess he has been feeling lonely. One night out, he was being rude to me because we were arguing about processed chicken (stupid, I know lol) and he said that he's going to pray for me and that I need religion/Jesus and he was serious. I guess he was drunk, but he was also saying some other rude things that turned me off from our friendship. All in all, he was just being a jerk.

So, Natalie wants to go to Puerto Rico with the four of us. It's just going to be f*cking awkward. I don't like Victor, less so as a friend now. Natalie and Ura are going to be lovey-dovey, smooshy, coupled up the whole time, leaving me defenseless with Victor.

I want the freedom to go to a different country and talk to whoever I want to. I don't want to feel obligated to hang out with Victor. 

I have suggested that Natalie and I just go by ourselves, but she's insisting that we all go as a group. I've already told her that I didn't feel comfortable with this, as it's going to put me in an awkward situation, but kind of backed out because I was afraid she would get mad at me. She hasn't asked either of them, but the trip is probably planned for August or July of this year.

I REALLY want to go on this trip. I just don't want to go with this set of people. I want to go with another girl so I won't feel awkward being coupled up. I'm afraid if I go, I am going to be miserable the whole time and would have wasted my money.

What should I do? Refuse to go? Suck it up and go? Am I overreacting?

Help!

29349,Non-Romantic,1vl121,"So I met this woman through an ex-girlfriend of mine while I was still dating my ex. We became reasonably good friends at the time, but when my ex dumped me, I lost touch with that group of people.

Flash-forward a year or so, my ex and I get on really good terms, I re-acclimate to that social circle, everything is cool. I reconnect with the woman, and we get really close independently of my ex.

I started to develop a bit of a crush on her, and I was very upfront about it with her. She let me down easy, citing my ex as the primary reason why she wouldn't consider a romantic relationship (along with the fact that the majority of her friends will forever know me as my ex's ex). I was upfront about my crush on her with my ex, too, mostly just wanting her... not 'approval,' but... I dunno, I just wanted to make sure she was cool with it and she knew I was being sincere.

Anyway, yeah, this all culminated in the woman and I having a drunken discussion about why she didn't think we should date, and that was immediately followed by us having sex.

I was totally cool with the rejection. Honestly, her friendship was the important part to me. The sex hit me as a kinda mixed-signal because I'm really not accustomed to this, but I was in no way expecting drunken, 5am sex to be an indication of a romantic relationship.

Anyway, yeah, what followed was weeks of her either cancelling plans or just outright ignoring me. When we see each other in person, per necessity, it's friendly in a kinda distant, acquaintance sorta way. I've entirely stopped trying to contact her or make plans.

I wanna be really clear, no part of me considers the idea of us being a couple to be even remotely possible. I know it won't happen, and it honestly doesn't bother me. I'm really bummed that I lost a close friend out of this, though. If it had occurred to me that I'd be losing a friend, I absolutely wouldn't have gone through with it, even though I had a thing for her.

What can I do? When I do see her, we're both with other people and there's really no opening for a one-on-one. I can't text her or try to call because I'll, in all likelihood, be ignored.

Last month, we hit a point where our business is self-sustaining and paying us enough to leave our jobs, with some income to spare.  Our new schedules keep us up until about 3-4am every night.  That means that we sleep until 11am or so every day.  That's when we noticed that we have a fucking banshee living above us a few days a week.


A few weeks ago, we were rattled out of bed by screams of a toddler at 6am on a Saturday.  This screaming continued pretty much all day.  The mom and grandmother tried to console the shrieking child by loudly saying, it's okay, it's okay.  This fourteen episode fit drove my dogs crazy, to the point where they were barking most of the day.  This continued until about 8pm.

I was very close with my mother and find her a very nice, loving, soft person. she can be weak, lazy but is well intentioned and generally a very good person.


I'm not as close to my father. I have not liked him for a good few years but decided to put up with him hoping he would either change, improve work better with my mom. I think he thinks I am closer to him than i actually am but I do it more to please him as I know he loves me and is proud. He is hard working, loyal, does try his best for his family but i think ultimately fails and is a bad father. He is far too strict on his children, not respectful to my mother and is conservative, believing he knows best and we should follow his rules without listening to reasoning.


I'm the oldest so I've been told not to do this and that when i was younger as it will be a bad example for my siblings but I believe my father is now setting a bad example and has been for awhile.

I say this as my mother is weak to an extent and I think my dad bullies her so I need to stand up for her to an extent.


Regardless all of this is background. In short what happened about 4 months ago made me stop talking to my parents and I've barely said a word to them in this time. My dad was being very disrespectful to my mom by just acting like a bit of a dickhead and I said this to him. We got into a long argument where he went in lengths to explain how its hard for him to change his views (on his rules for us kids) but he has stepped back (which he has in fairness and it is difficult for him) from trying to control us. So some of this parenting has gone through my mom and he thinks she's being to relaxed with us (mainly my siblings) so he gives out to her. He also said that he finds himself doing a lot of the work for the family and she doesnt do enough, that she has loads of free time and doesnt help him enough/do what he has asked her to help with.

29395,Non-Romantic,2serhr,"So my best friend and roommate decided to adopt a cat on a whim with his (thankfully now ex) girlfriend about a year ago. The cat was to stay in our apartment, as his parents were against having her at their house. While the decision was impulsive and terribly ill-advised, I'd always wanted a cat (though I don't have the financial means to pay for one myself), so I didn't mind her in the house.

When winter break came (we are both in college), he left to stay at home. We are about 30 minutes away at our apartment from our hometown, and they made almost no effort to come see the cat. He left food and litter for her, and that's just about it. The one time they did come to visit the cat, they took her to stay at the ex's house, as she said her parents were fine with having the cat there. This was not so. She locked the cat in her dark, unfinished basement for a few days (she didn't even bring the box with her!) and was eventually found out by her parents' dogs. The cat was promptly returned to our apartment.

After winter break, my friend came back to our apartment, and everything was fine for a few months. He would still go home on weekends, but he would at least pay attention to the cat. I noticed, however, that every time he was around the cat would start regularly throwing up. I, much later, found at that he was constantly over feeding her and putting catnip in her food so she would eat it. Cats can't digest catnip. At this point he has cleaned the box maybe once, and I have done it the rest of the time.

Summer break comes, and he leaves for about four months, only to visit the cat twice (and once was because we were going to a concert in the city). His mother continues to pay for food, litter, and the cat rent of about $25/month (he has no job). I continue to deliver this food to the cat, clean up after her, and give her the love and snuggles this particularly affectionate cat so desperately needs. At this point he broke up with his ex.

When he came back in Fall, the puking started again, and I suggest he take her to the vet, as she might be really messed up (she originally came from an abusive home). He refused, on the basis that the documents at the vet have both his and ex's names on them, and he couldn't be assed to go to a different vet.

It's now winter break again, and he's come by to visit her once. The lease doesn't end until August, but I'm worried at that point what will come of the cat. I graduate in the spring, and will begin pursuing a full-time job. I will have the money, finally, to support a furry friend. He has another year of school. Initially, the parents said the cat would not be allowed to live with them, but sometimes I worry that they may change their minds. She is a great cat.

Basically, I've gotten really attached to the damn thing after caring for her by myself for, at this point, about a total of seven to eight months since they got her a year ago. By August it will have been about twelve, and I'm feeling like this is pretty much my cat. Should I make a huge fuss about it when/if they try to take her away in August, or should I let this happen quietly? What should I do?

She met her current husband only a few months after we became friends and married him shortly after that. They kept the marriage a secret from almost everyone (including me) for three or four years because they married so he could get his citizenship. She eventually told me and others and admitted that they did not intend to stay together after he received his papers and everything (not completely sure how that works), but that it ended up being more than that so they stayed together.

I'm not really sure where to start. Her husband is not a good guy, and I am not the only one who thinks this. None of our mutual friends like him and her family basically refuses to admit they are married or even that he exists. He has no desire to see them and they have no desire to see him so they both just pretend the other does not exist. 

He does not have a job. He has no desire to work. He is never home and is always with friends.

My friend works full time. She also, up until recently when her husband graduated, did all of his school work while she was working on her degree and working full time. 

She has gained a lot of weight since we met. She has no self esteem anymore. She has changed so much. She is excellent at her job but refuses to acknowledge it. 

She never wants to go out or do things anymore. She cooks and cleans and works full time all while her husband does who knows what. 

She caught him cheating about two years ago and almost left him. He begged her to stay and she did. The details of the situation are pretty vague, I think she's in denial about it and never talks about it. 

I am actually afraid of her husband. I do not trust him. He is volatile and has emotional outbursts. She has mentioned that he is moody and can go from happy to angry in an instant. When I do see him, which is rare, he acts weird and makes me feel uncomfortable. 

They don't ever want to do couple-y things together or hang out, which makes me sad because she is my best friend.

I have tried occasionally to gently speak about their relationship but she is very close-mouthed about everything. She literally never speaks about any aspects of their relationship other than casually mentioning little tidbits--never anything negative at all. I find this out of the ordinary. Friends confide in each other and talk about their relationships. 

I have never seen any signs of physical abuse but I am suspicious that there is some sort of abuse going on. 

I'm not sure if she is in any actual, physical danger. But I am worried about her mental and emotional state. She does an okay job of putting on a good front but she has definitely changed as I mentioned before. 

She has also converted to his religion. Before this she was not religious at all. 


I feel like he is just a leech. He definitely has it good-- school done for him, meals cooked, free money, does whatever he wants. 

I'm not sure if I've done a good job of explaining any of this. I don't want to be too specific because I'm afraid this would hurt her if she saw it. I'm just very worried about her and I don't know how much longer I can be her friend without doing or saying anything.

I don't know what the situation is between Steph and Nick so I figure if we meet up I'll ask if she wants to hang out with him.  Also I do not tell him since if I do I worry that he'll badger me to bring her to him and I don't want to be in that situation.

Well she calls me this evening and ask if I want to meet at Nick's house and hang out.  She does say we can do somethig else also but wanting to be a good friend I say, lets meet there.

Well I get over there a few minutes early and see him trying to clean up the entire house, I ask about this Jake guy.  He responds that Jake is her thrall, does what ever she wants.  They show up and we all get to talking.  

Recently as noted above I broke up with my girlfriend.  So I took the classic Reddit advice, or at least part of it (hit the gym).  I have done so and lost 30lbs, gained muscles, bought better fitting and stylish clothes.  I have no mentioned any of this to Steph or Jake directly since they are at best acquaintances.  Well after we all sit for a few minutes the subject of my weight lose comes up, in a rather forced way by Nick since he knows I have quit drinking (calories and stability) so I reply no I'm not drinking, working on my weight lose etc.  Nick blurts out that 

Oh yeah Justin and his GF broke up.  He's quit drinking to lose weight to get her back.

Now at this point I'm pissed off.
  
1. That is not the reason I'm losing weight, I'm sick of being a fat guy, I want to be healthy, look good, and fit in stylish clothing all of which he knows.

2. This is not his thing to tell to a girl I barely know and a guy I met for the first time ever about 3 mins ago and was still trying to get to know.
I don't introduce him to people as This is divorced Nick, its why he drinks so much.

3. He forced this conversation to begin with.  He could have just gotten me a water or skipped me.  I think he wanted this to happen to point out to Steph that I was still interested in my ex (which I am and working on) and make himself look good for caring.  (He's so impressed with the weight I've lost for my ex.)

Now they all go out to smoke, I stay in and fume a bit.  When they come back in its time for a Mortal Kombat tourney.  So we all sit and take turns passing around controllers etc.  I end up beating everyone but Nick (we have a pretty even win/lose record against each other.)  He starts shit talking about how good he is all the time etc.  First this is bullshit, we are evenly matched imo.  Second who the fuck thinks Mortal Kombat skills will impress anyone? 

So I make up some shit and get out of there.  I went to a bar to socialize and maybe decompress a bit but here I am an hour later and writing this.  This just feels like HS bullshit, I used to (note, used to) have a friend that would pull this shit in groups but was fine one on one.  

So reddit am I being a dick or is my friend trying to put me down to get girls to like him?  Should I confront him or let it go?

I posted this in non-romantic because I want it to *stay* non-romantic.

So this guy I know is about 20. I've been in a sort of club with him since I was 10. I'm fine with his company, but we're not really good friends. He's not very interesting to talk to, he's not huge on the personal hygiene thing, etc. I know for a fact he is (or at least was) interested in dating me romantically,and I made it clear I do not reciprocate those feelings. (He knew me when I was 10... it feels a little crib-robber-ish and creepy...) It's been about a year since I last made clear I wan't interested.

[He asked me to go to the fair with him once,](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/39w06d/i_17f_hesitantly_scheduled_a_hangout_he20m/) and I reluctantly agreed to go with him. After that, he asked me to hang out again. I feel bad for the guy (he doesn't have really any friends) and I didn't know how to say no. 

We walked around town, and I was honestly uncomfortable walking alone with him. He said something like Oh my apartment's nearby, we should stop by and see if my dad's there which set off HUGE red flags for me. I really don't want to be involved with him. He's got a hint of Aspergers, so maybe it was an innocent reference to how close his apartment was, that I just misread? And he didn't realize how suggestive it might sound?

Anyways, he asked me if I wanted to hang out again (his confidence is going up; he didn't ask, just said Let's hang out again, do this a third time) and now he wants to get Italian food. I do not want to get Italian food. I don't like hanging out with him, especially one-on-one (if I can't get out of Italian food, I'll bring my brother along). 

He always refers to these sessions as hangouts. He knows they're not dates. But maybe *I* haven't made that clear enough.

How do I say no when a lonely dude wants to hang out? Is it likely this is just platonic to him? Come to think of it, he only ever asks ME for hugs and never male band members. He only ever sends ME cutesy emoticons, and he only ever asks me to hang out. How do I say no?

29434,Non-Romantic,372vj0,"In advance, sorry for the long story. Dunno which details were important. 

I had a very good male friend. We had similar tastes, the same circle of friends, and could spend hours just talking and having fun. 

In retrospect, I wonder why the hell I missed all these obvious signs but I think it's because he is the kind of nice guy who can't say no to anybody, and he was nice and considerate towards people in general, so I never felt singled out in my interactions with him. 

Long story short, after we (me, him and about six other friends we always hang out with) went drinking and it became the two of us by some random chance, he began the conversation saying that there was something he wanted to tell me. At that moment, I suddenly realized what was going to happen, and ... I guess I didn't handle that too well. All I could think at that point was, no! We're both too drunk for this and I don't want us to mess up our friendship! So I stopped him from talking and told him, to please, not say anything, that I didn't want to hear it, we're too drunk for this. 

I don't know what I was expecting to happen. Maybe I thought we'd wake up sober and everything would magically get better? I don't know... What happened was the next day, he disappeared off the face of the earth, and scared the hell out of all of us. He had left off to his cousin's house out of town without telling anybody, even his parents, who had also freaked out because they were supposed to have dinner together. Since then, he started showing problems, drinking excessively and beginning to smoke, skipping class and withdrawing from us. 

It's been six months since that night and he is getting treated for depression and his attempted suicide attempts. We don't contact each other and I usually hear how he's doing from mutual friends who don't know what happened between us. 

Rationally, I understand that this isn't my fault, but emotionally, I freeze up everytime I think about it. I wonder if I could've handled this differently, if I could've handled it better. I'm afraid I'll hurt someone else as badly without meaning to. I'm afraid one day I'm going to get a call from his family that he died and I'm going to wonder every day if I caused it. 

And yet I feel selfish, because I'm not just afraid of him dying but for my responsibility in it. Not to mention it feels really arrogant to think that I'm important enough to have caused somebody to become suicidal. Maybe it's just because of something else. 

I don't really know what sort of question I'm asking at this point... Just if there's anybody with similar experiences, I'd really appreciate how you dealt with it/how I should deal.

29441,Non-Romantic,2yj1o4,"I'll start with why this is such a big deal to me as best I can with a bit of background.

I grew up around a lot of boys. I was the only girl in my current family's generation. I rough house I play video games I am not the most Girly girl in the world. (I wear makeup and I enjoy putting it on for artsy purposes. I am surely not typical though.)

Growing up I was constantly made fun of for having a gap between my front teeth and a lot of the girls in my class hated me and I never even spoke to them. I also have Panic disorder and I feel like my heart is going to stop when I get in awkward situations where I feel like I am being judged. I was constantly picked on so ALL through out my high school days I was used to being alone with a couple guy friends (They just get me better and didn't bad mouth me or make me feel unaccepted). I prefer them over the girls that constantly picked on me. And I only had maybe 3 friends. One is a girl but she has the same problem as me but she is making so many friends and I just want to fit in a little better. I don't know how she does it so easily while I am struggling. All of which I have been friends with for over 2 - 6 years.

So now I am in college and only 1 of my friends goes to school with me at my university (Not including my boyfriend so I guess that's 2 technically but he takes mostly online courses) So I wanted to try and make new friends and start fresh. Get a better reputation and more self confidence. Well, I am two semesters in and not doing so well. 

I found a group of people with similar interests, many of them my boyfriend knows some way or another but none of them seem to really like me and they only really know me because of him. I feel like I get avoided by them

1.Because when I sit by myself they find somewhere else to sit when I would really enjoy their company

2. Because I feel like I am a constant nuisance to them and even when I am around I don't feel included in conversation.

Now, onto this person I am trying to befriend:

   I met this guy who had a love for tea, video games, and art (As do I so I really wanted to try and make friends and have some one to socialize with every now and again that has stuff in common so it wouldn't be so hard to try and connect.) We talk about stuff and just as I thought we were becoming good friends, he got angry at me for being polite and what he said was Apologizing constantly (I am apologetic. If I feel as though I have offended anyone in the slightest, then I have to apologize or I will feel absolutely awful about it.)

 Not only that when I asked for his phone number he said You are NOT going to text me. Why didn't you ask -blah blah- for my number if you wanted it so bad? Not only that but every time I just text Hey he doesn't reply. However if I offer booze at a friends house he is all for it. But other than that ignores me and its making me feel really bad about myself. 

At the same time I feel like I come on too strong because I don't know how to make a first impression and school is getting really difficult for me when I can't seem to fit in YET AGAIN.

Am I being overly obnoxious or annoying? I ask my boyfriend constantly if I am acting in a way that makes him or others upset and he always says no, but its seriously breaking me down not being able to make a single new friend at my university without feeling like I am only tolerated. I just don't understand how he could just flip a switch and suddenly think I am so bad. What am I doing wrong? How do I make friends and not look stupid? I feel terrible about my social standing.

I guess what I am really wondering is how to tell if someone is joking or being serious with me, and what are things that people do when they dislike you? When should I back off?

My mother found a four/five day adventure break and we're both happy with a fairly cheap deal and great sounding list of activities. A couple of days ago I floated the idea of my boyfriend coming along with us while we were talking about the trip.

My boyfriend and I have been together a couple of years, and are moving in together soon. Things are going amazingly well. For the first year we were long(ish) distance, and my mother has met him a few times, and they both got on well - my boyfriend always brings little gifts or flowers for her, and has generally made an effort to make a good impression from the start. We're relaxed in her company and are respectful, ie not all over each other.

So back to me floating the idea of him coming along. She said yeah, if you're still with him that'd be fine. 

This morning she calls me and seems very upset over me 'sabotaging' her trip, and calls me 'boring as shit' - she's suddenly dead against him coming along, with the only coherent points I can hear being that she wants something for just me and her and no one else. I told her I'd already invited him after our coversation, which I'll admit was a bit silly - I got pretty excited about us all going. 

She hangs up and calls back later, proposing a new idea that my brother, who we both have hardly seen in five years and she actively dislikes should come along. At this point I'm so confused as to her reasons, as she just told me she wanted it to be for me and her. I argued back, telling her she was being unreasonable, she called me a liar and said we basically never had the conversation we did about him coming.

Why is she is causing a huge fuss over a few days away next year? Its putting me in an awkward position and I feel like telling her to just not book it.

Now I will mention that my mother is quite impulsive and tends to go back on the things she says, denying she's said things.
She also holds grudges for record-breaking stretches of time, slams doors, patronises me horribly, and has childish tantrums occasionally.

Their relationship wasn't always healthiest. They would usually argue because they just don't know what they get up to.

29489,Non-Romantic,2dpcbi,"So, this is a bit of a crazy story, it's kinda weird and a bit petty so bear with me. My family and I live in a small apartment building owned by my grandfather, and in it we have another tenant who we shall Chickenhater for anonymity. 

My father has spent the entire summer building a chicken coop in the backyard, and he's retired for health reasons so when I mean the entire summer I mean he was out there seven days a week for hours building the coop from scratch. Chickenhater has known about our plans since he got started, and was all happy about it and seemed to be excited for the chickens, all smiles and cheerfulness and asking about them. 

However, the in the past few weeks things took a different turn with chickenhater. At first, we got an anonymous letter of our towns laws and regulations concerning chickens and other animals... from 2004. Like seriously, I think she used a time machine I don't even know where she got a printout of the outdated laws. The updated laws allow chickens, and there after already two houses on our block alone that have chickens, three including ours. 

For a while, we weren't sure who the letter came from. Who would hate on chickens? Eventually, we got a phone call from the landlord. Apparently, chickenhater sent a very harsh letter to him about the chickens and the coop, saying how it's a nuisance and how it ruins the view of the backyard, and she made it clear she wants it GONE. 

We are very grateful that we were warned because we found someone who's willing to take in our chickens already, but we've grown attached to them and my father refuses to take down the coop he put so much time into. Chickenhater recently sent another letter to the landlord, saying that she would have never moved in if she knew about the chickens and is demanding a 25% discount on her rent, or else send in the city inspectors, as we didn't get a permit and its less than 25ft away from the building. (She's not getting the discount, I know that for sure. My family isn't too keen on threats and blackmail.)

The thing is in her letters she wrote how having the coop there prevented her from bringing friends over (wut?) and how it was ruining her sleep. Besides being insanely stupid arguments, they are completely untrue. I've lost track of how many times she's disturbed my sleep as she YELLS to people on the phone (she hates service people and is only nice when she wants something from you) and blasts her tv during the night because it helps her sleep. My bedroom is right below her appt, and the walls are paper thin! And our chickens are actually pretty quiet, we hear our neighbors chickens more than our own.


She straight up lies in her letters, too! She says that the lights on them keep her awake, when we turn them on for ten minutes around eight pm  to poop scoop the run. She says that she hasn't known about the coop, when she's known about it SINCE WE STARTED BUILDING. Does she think the coop appeared out of nowhere?  It's kind of funny, she doesn't talk to my parents or me and tries to ignore us, when she used to talk a lot before. She doesn't even accept any of the vegetables we grow in the garden and share with our tenants and neighbors anymore.

As much as I would looooove to yell expletives every time I see her, is there any way to deal with the situation? I was considering buying a can of liquid ass and dumping it on her balcony, but she would probably know who did it... she knows we're not happy with her. And I'd really rather not get in trouble with the law.


I'm not even going to bother pretending I know the laws concerning leases, but I can damn well tell you she isn't going to get hers renewed. But since I have many months left of putting up with her two-faced lying shit, how do I deal with her? Can she get evicted for lying? Should I pour liquid ass and stink bombs on her balcony?

29503,Non-Romantic,3ilt3x,"As you can imagine, this is a very terrible situation. I will begin with a little back story. I have known this person, might as well call him Sam, for over 10 years. He had a younger brother, Dan, who is 5 years his junior. A few of my friends that I have stayed in touch with since we left school knew him. All of them say the same thing; when Dan started year 7 (11/12 years old) he was a friendly and kind boy. By year 8 though, he was acting out constantly at school and at home and getting numerous detentions/punishments for his behavior. I knew the family well but not as well as I thought now, and the persona they always attributed it to, was him just being a really naughty child. He was tested multiple times for mental disorders such as ADHD and autism, all of which came back negative. He was the only one in the family of 4 children who was behaving this way and at 15 he ended up being put into care. At the time it seemed like they simply couldn't deal with him.

Fast forward 5 years, I found out by a friend that Sam, who was 18 at the time, had molested and forced Dan to perform (at minimum) oral sex on him. I was obviously disgusted. It took me a few days to wrap my head around it and suddenly Dan's behavior made complete sense. The time of abuse coincided with Dan's decline. My friend also told me that during the abuse Sam used to send notes to Dan saying things along the lines of 'Do you want to have some fun?'. Dan being straight and evidently messed up by the abuse sent a letter to his sister saying the same thing. He was under the impression what was happening to him was normal and acceptable. His sister took it straight to their parents and horrifyingly, they did nothing! As I mentioned earlier Dan ended up in care.

A couple of weeks later I was just chatting to Sam's boyfriend (at the time, now ex), we will call him Jack, about some issues they were having with their relationship and he mentioned that Sam had a 'dark' past. We conversed further until we both discovered that we both knew about the situation. Jack found out because he found fuck you written on Sam's wall and pressed it until Sam admitted to him what happened. After our conversation, Jack went back to Sam and told him that I knew. Sam became furious that his secret was getting out.

Later that evening I went to a friend's house, we will call her Jane. At the time it was me, Jane, Sam and his Jack. He was still upset about me finding out and a discussion broke out about the situation. Summing up the conversation and despite him crying, it was very apparent that Sam felt no remorse about his actions and blamed his brother for the abuse! Sam words were He was such a little shit. He deserved it.. I haven't kept in touch with Jane since then. Sam and Jack broke up not long after and ended up having a massive argument. Jack then told me that he had also molested another boy in the same time period and that boy was only 13. Sam also admitted this to me in person after I found out. I have a very strong theory of who he is. He was becoming a friend to us as he was interested in music and wanted to learn. Sam was meant to be tutoring him. I recall, all of a sudden, he just stopped talking to us all. No one seemed to know why and when I saw him in a fast food restaurant a few years later and he completely blanked me.

Another argument between Sam and Jack ensued and Jack decided he didn't want to keep a secret like that any more. Admittedly, I was keeping it to myself at the time. I just didn't really know what to do. Jack told a couple of my other closest friends about what was happened and it quickly spread. Sam is lying to them all saying it was mutual touching and nothing more. Horrendous none the less, right?! I am not sure people are aware of the other boy. Our once large friend group is now divided. On one side there are the people that are disgusted and never want anything to do with him again. On the other side there are people that say 'it was a long time ago' and don't believe that there was oral sex or those that don't really want to have an opinion on the matter. I have barely been out since it spread as I have been really busy. I am concerned that I am going to lose good friends over this. I am going to a party this weekend and as I am so close to the situation by seeing Sam's admissions first hand, I am expecting to be bombarded with questions about what the truth really is. I do have a very revealing text between Jack and Sam on my phone with Jack accusing him of it all and Sam admitting it by saying I am a monster. I just want piece in our group again.

TL;DR: My best friend molested his brother and made him perform oral sex and molested another boy. They were both 13 when he was 18. He has no remorse and blames the abuse of his brother, on his brother. Our friend group is divided and I am worried I am going to loose friends as I am so close to the situation. I have a text that pretty much proves his guilt.


What do I do now? What are your opinions on the situation?

29505,Non-Romantic,31xo1u,"My sister and I have always had an off and on again relationship. She is 31 and I am 28. We both have a couple kids and always are really close when we are talking. But normally she is the one to stop talking to me. This time is was different.

First off I do enjoy talking with her and having her in my life but I can't give her the time she wants. I live out of state so we don't see each other as often. But we would talk every day, many times a day. And if I was busy or something she would blow up my phone or accuse me of sleeping of ignoring her.

Also her husband is a real jerk. He thinks it okay to slap my butt and talk about my body. Asking if he could touch it and things like that. Now I would just laugh it off but it was kinda uncomfortable. No, he's never done anything to me. Also he would yell at my kids and be really disrespectful to them at times.

My sister have a couple kids like I mentioned and they aren't bad kids but they are very rough and joke a lot. They repeat the things they hear their parents say. Like one day my nephew text me and called me a fat scrub. I don't think that coming out of a 12 year olds mouth is very respectful. He's also pushed me into the wall before to show me how strong he was. I don't think that is very cool.

My sisters family does no wrong. And whenever someone stops talking to them they find a way to tell that person they owe them money for something. In my case they tried to tell me I owed them $500 for medical bills because my 6 year old child at the time broke my sisters foot. No one believed it when it happened. 

Also they will do anything to make your life a living hell. They tried to tell my boyfriend of 2 years that I cheated on him. And when we stopped talking a few years ago they called my child's father and started a lot of problems. They seem to love drama. 

She likes to name call and just make other people feel shitty. If I would visit my hometown and not spend the night at her house she would take it the wrong way. She didn't have the room with all my kids and her family. I felt like she was always judging me and I could never make her happy. 

Also her and out mom don't talk and that would take a toll on our relationship. She would bad talk my mom. Even in front of my children and of course my oldest daughter would tell her grandma what was being said. 

So my question is, why do I feel so horrible about ending it? But also I feel relieved too. I didn't fight or say anything mean to her when this happen but she said a lot of rude things I just blew off. So I never got to tell her how I felt and completely why I did what I did. So do I do that now or just let it go? Also I don't want to ever talk to her again and that makes me feel sad but I know things will never change. How do I get over cutting her out of my life forever?

I used to have a crush on her when we were really young, but she rejected me, but we still hung out.  We really didn't become good friends until after her brother died 5 years ago from a motorcycle accident.  Before she moved back, she lived about ~2 hours away, and have only talked/hung out a few times in the past few years.


I helped her move in, and she offered to pay me.  I politely declined, I really don't think anyone should have to pay a friend for help.  Since the move, I've helped her with a few things.  Unpack a little, wall mount her TV and some shelves, and helped her through a recent breakup with her ex that didn't want a long distance relationship.  I really enjoy hanging out with her, and I'd be lying to myself if I said I wish we weren't more, but I value this friendship and don't want to push her away.  She told me last week, Jay, I was thinking, and I realized that you're my best friend.  You're always there for me since we were young.

I'm also pretty handy, I enjoy doing small projects around my place and with my car, and jump at the chance to help friends and family when they are doing their own projects.  I'm also introverted, awkward, but I do love hanging out with a small circle of friends, and I'm the guy that makes jokes based on comical observations.  Lastly, I've been single for a while (over a year), and I've stopped seeking dates.

I tell her, I really don't mind, I enjoy hanging out with you... why do you feel like you have to give me something in return, shouldn't us hanging out be enough?  Not wanting to make a long story longer, she basically repeats that she has nothing to offer me a few more times.  I drop her off at her place, and I drive home a little angry.  Am I being pitied?

29524,Non-Romantic,1phcrv,"I have been best friends with this girl for going on two years now. The first year was rough. I was in love with her, and she was really shitty to me. There were weeks when we didn't talk to each other because of things she did to me and manipulated me, but these things are not that relevant to the story.

The past year, we got really close as friends, and I'm not in love with her anymore. There was one time where we did have sex, but it was a one time thing, and we like to joke about it because it was awkward. There are still some feelings there, but it is not near as bad as it was last year. We text constantly every day, and it's odd when she doesn't text back. It has been like this since we have been friends. I have never connected to anybody like I have with her. My family loves her like she's one of their own. 

About two weeks ago, she started acting odd. We would text less, and she would always have an excuse to not hang out with me. One day she didn't text me at all. When I asked her about it, she said she wasn't in a talkative mood. This was odd, because in the two years that I've known her, she has never done this. I left her alone and she texted me the next day. I started to get the feeling that she was upset with me about something, but I couldn't figure out why.

I finally asked her if she was upset with me, and she said she wasn't, but she was distancing herself. I asked her why, and she said that she is trying to smoke less (we smoke weed together quite often),we don't have anything in common anymore, and she is trying to motivate herself, and we are in different parts of our lives right now. She said she couldn't not talk to me because I would text her five times a day asking why she wasn't talking to me. She said she needed some space. I of course got upset and we didn't really talk for the next two days. 

I texted her a few days later and told her that I wasn't prepared to lose her as a friend, and that if she was planning on walking out of my life, that it wasn't fair to me, (I used a line from Walking Dead) I said that she can't come into my life, make me care, and then leave. She didn't respond, and I didn't expect her to.

I texted her the next day and said that I had a solution that would make us both happy. My solution was to stop texting each other so much. If we stopped texting each other all day every day, we would have things to talk about when we were actually together. I didn't get to explain this to her, because she said she didn't want to talk to me, and that I needed to stop texting her. That was yesterday.

I didn't get much sleep last night. I decided that when she does want to talk, and if she wants to work it out, I am all for that. But if she doesn't even want to try to work it out, I'm going to give her the big fuck you. My plan would be to ask her to come over and say goodbye to me, and then tell her how big of a slap in the face this is. I put so much work into the beginning of our friendship and went through so much of her shit, and it was all for nothing. All to just be tossed to the side like a toy she got bored with. I love her, but I can't do this anymore. She's put me through too much in the past, and if she doesn't want to work it out, she isn't worth my time anymore. It hurts to say, but people have been telling me this since we have been friends. Let me reiterate though. Things the past year up to this point have been fantastic! No bumps on the road, no fights, no nothing. It was only the first year of our friendship that was hard, and it felt worth it when everything became right.

Well after moping about being a bit depressed I made an excuse to drop by Brides. We had an amazing chat with her fiance present.

The bombshell was apparently that e-mail girl has had a massive thing against me the entire year. I texted her from college when I heard she started dating my ex as the person who told me made it sound like she'd thought I'd be angry. It just said I'd heard was was happy for her and hoped to see her soon. I never heard back but she kicked off saying that she didn't need my permission but has been overwhelmingly insecure about her relationship and screeches at him that he's going to leave her soon very often. I don't know what else she has said about me but my impression that I threatened her was correct. She has had extreme mood swings and been very touchy in general.

Bride told me she only asked her to be bridesmaid because she feared the fall out if she didn't, and was humiliated at her behaviour. We had such a lovely chat about our relationship and everything and ended up having a group hug with her fiance ha! At the end of the day I'm a busy girl and I unfortunately have had a very poorly mum who I have dedicated a lot of time to. Even worse we recently found out that my boyfriend's sole surviving parent has terminal cancer and we are going to have a lot on our plate caring for them as well as having our demanding jobs. Bride knew this and knew I couldn't accept any more commitments.

Today I went out with Bride, email girl and a few others. Out of choice I rode in email girls car there and back and chatted for ages to make an effort. She was clearly very wary at first but relaxed as the day went on. She let slip that she has had some issues of her own which I won't go into. I don't trust her, but I'm a bit softer towards her. I was nothing but lovely to her and I could almost see the cogs turning in her head, the realisation that actually she might have been the one acting out of order, not me. She also said that she barely sees Bride and would prefer to be on the Stag!

This is not your typical best friend about to marry a psychopath/abusive/rapist asshole post. It's actually the opposite. Would greatly appreciate your insight as I'm at a loss as to what to do.

My best friend of 12 years is awesome, let's call her Jackie. She is the most loyal, fun, smart, charismatic friend I could ask for. However, she has a problem with men. All her past relationships are over the top dramatic.  She still has a tattoo of some guy's name on her ass.

She met a boy named Rob over a year ago and fell head over heels in love. They've been dating ever since. Rob is genuinely a nice guy, a bit socially awkward but a very endearing engineer but loves her to bits. 
Half a year into them dating, she got it into her head that she really wanted to get married, and told Rob so. At the end of last year, he got down on one knee and proposed. However since they've been engaged, she has turned into a monster on him and I can see he is slowly spiralling into depression. 
She would berate him, constantly picking fights, just generally passive aggressive or unpleasant. His biggest dream was to travel the world. When they first got engaged, he said he had wanted to do that before they got married, he also happened to have a career break. He invited her to join him but she couldn't/didn't want to so he went by himself and as soon as he had left, she would guilt him/pick fights and was just generally nasty to him until he gave in and came home, cutting his trip short. 
Since he's been back, he is getting really depressed. She says it's from travelling for too long by himself without a purpose. I think he may be having second thoughts about the marriage. She wants him to just 'get it together' so they can start their life together.

She often calls me to complain about him and the relationship. I think a lot of what she says are quite deluded and selfish and I don't think they're in a position to be getting married.

What can I, as a friend possibly say to her without over stepping my boundaries. Keep in mind, I love this girl to death, she is only ever like this with her bfs and never with her friends.  I truly want her to be happy, I also don't want to lose a friend. Should I let her make her continue to treat the 'love of her life' this way and make her own mistakes? She genuinely does not see herself as being in the wrong.

* They have been dating 2 years, not engaged.
* My friend and I have been best friends for nearly 20 years.
* Our date is set for early fall 2015.  

**Edit: I am a groomzilla apparently. To some level, I agree. It still bothers me that they intentionally hid their plans. It was going to come out eventually, so why bother to hide it? Going to rethink and discuss the compromise. There are still financial issues for friends involved, including myself.**

We have had our date set for 2 months, and known the general time-frame for 3 or more months. All of this we have communicated with them as we were aware they were considering getting married too, but didn't know for sure. We also expressed concern that we and our friends can't afford two weddings so close (wedding party members will overlap a lot) as we are all just out of college or wrapping up our last year.

Around a month ago, some of their actions seemed to indicate they where doing some wedding planning, so we would ask if they had a date or time-frame in mind, a question which they ignored. Again later they made some indications of planning and again we asked, which my friend replied 'we know you guys have your date set and paid for, and we will work around it.

Two days ago, they text asking where our venue is so they don't book the same one. We reply and ask if they have a date. They reply with 'oh, fun, that's a cool place!' We then reply asking directly do you have a date? At this point, they tell us it is 26 days before ours. (I have since found out from another friend that the couple have known this date for a month). After a long phone call with my friend, I was under the impression they where touring venues and intending to put money down soon. Given their behavior about asking dates, had we not pried, I don't think we would have known until they had money down as well. It seemed they were going to strong-arm us into letting them take that date.

On the phone call with my friend, we discussed why the timing was chosen. He has applied to med schools and *hopes* to be accepted and entering med school fall 2014. They wish to avoid attempting to plan and put on the wedding during med school due to the stress of school, and waiting until after is a negative due to length having to wait and a direct family member of theirs who will likely not be able to attend in the same capacity if they wait 4+ years. These reasons I can appreciate, even if I don't fully agree that doing it during first summer of med school is impossible. They also said because anything sooner is less than a year out, finding a venue for earlier is next to impossible.

What bothers me is that they didn't come forward and try to discuss this with us as soon as they thought they might do it close to ours. It bothers me even more that is seems they actively hid their date from us. Correct me if I am wrong, but that seems incredibly disrespectful. It is hard enough that it feels like we are being upstaged, but this just twists the dagger.

It seems my friend's GF will refuse to move their date back, despite us expressing our concerns about feeling upstaged as politely as possible, as well as the financial burden it will have on us and our friends. (side note: she has gotten wedding crazy previous times when her friends where getting engaged and there was no serious talk about them getting married until literally the day we announced our engagement)

For our own sanity, and an attempt to make it so the two weddings are not ruined by hard feelings, we are planning to offer to move ours 2 months back. I honestly feel we should not have to based on that we are engaged and have had our date set, but I understand they are pinned. In exchange we plan to ask that we get to claim our theme and colors (of which we already established) and they have to stay away from that. 

Is that compromise fair?

My girlfriend doesn't get along with her mum and plans to move out and cut her out of her life as soon as she can. My family are very loving, so I know that any advice I give is pretty much bullshit.

The thing is, I think her mum's okay - annoying, and really irritating, but okay. They're just not suited for each other; my girlfriend's very irritable and it stacks up. Her mum also has a history of depression, and it shows; she's short tempered and often shouts at her. My girlfriend shouts back.

It's a sad situation, because I think that if they were to both give a little more they'd be okay. They're stuck in a cycle, now, I think, and I don't know what to do.

I don't feel as if I can tell my girlfriend this so soon because I'm afraid of upsetting her too badly - she's quite unstable (history of self-harm and suicide attempts; low self-esteem), and quite frankly, I'm scared.

29628,Non-Romantic,34j8ep,"I'm using a throwaway for this since some of my co-workers know of my regular account, and also, this is a bit out of the ordinary for this subreddit.  However, it deals with my relationship with myself, my co-workers, and my wife and immediate family, so I think it still easily fits the purpose of /r/relationships and the great community advice it can provide on those fronts.

First, a little necessary background:

About three years ago, I got into a nasty political situation at a former job.  I had an amazing position in the prior place I was at, but I was promoted to a higher department, but only at the vague whim of the President of the university I worked at.  

It was very ill-thought, and because no one really knew what to do with me, I was shuffled around from multiple offices and supervisors.  I finally ended up with a very loosely defined supervisor, which was someone who had a very immature beef with me because I was chosen for a few staff awards over him and such the previous year.

The new supervisor made my life a living hell, continually giving me completely unrealistic deadlines, requirements, etc, in a very clear effort to force me out.  I talked to his supervisors and HR, but with no luck on any progress.  The higher ups couldn't do anything because they were in equally problematic  political positions of their own, and HR couldn't do anything because as a white male, I wasn't a protected class, and basically had no recourse to unethical treatment whatsoever.

After a lot of sleepless nights and stress, I made the hardest decision of my life and took another job elsewhere.  I stayed there for a year or so, basically as damaged goods mourning my old job I dearly loved before the promotion.  I took another job after that that I'm still in now, mainly because it was slightly more relevant to my interests and paid a bit better.

Flash forward to now, and I'm finding that I'm suddenly completely ambivalent about work any more.  I just do it because it pays the bills, not because it gives me any satisfaction or enjoyment.  In theory, it should be able to, but I think I've put up a mental block so that I won't get too heavily or emotionally invested in it.  I took such a huge blow in my life when I had to walk away from that old job, and I think I just don't want to let myself suffer that kind of thing again.  I think I've honestly become the same guy from Office Space, who just does the absolute minimum required.  But not because I don't care, but because I do care of what can happen to me and my family if I care too much.

In the past few weeks there has been a new hire at our office that's kind of shifted things around a bit.  He's super intense to an overbearing point.  While I enjoy his enthusiasm that had been severely lacking around our office, it can become quickly exhausting at times.  If he's to keep up this type of pace, it makes me wonder if I'm really as intense or invested as he tries to appear to be.

What's funny is that I see a lot of my old self in this guy.  He's looking for every angle and seems to love what he does.  That was me at my old job that I loved at the university.  But it just seems like a lifetime ago.  I'm afraid to let myself care or get nearly as invested as this guy is, for fear that I'll just be remaking the same old mistakes.  And also because I haven't really gotten a total feel for the guy yet, I'm apprehensive that he might pull the same type of political maneuvering that forced me out of that old job.

To sum it up, I'd love to be as enthusiastic again.  But I'm afraid to.  In the past two years I've shifted my life's priorities to be far more about what happens outside of work, even happily at the expense of the professional ladder I could be climbing under different priorities.

I know that with this new guy being so active and enthusiastic, I'll probably have to make some choices soon.  Either I subtly make it clear that I'm not interested in becoming so invested again and I'm happy to stay put in my career.  Or I buy into his whole schtick and become that guy again, at risk of another crushing blow of some type.

I know it's a decision that I have to ultimately make on my own, but I'd really love to hear the opinions of others as I explore everything and make up my mind.

I’ve gone through a roller coaster of a relationship with my dad in the sense that it’s gone from nonexistent, to good, to bad, to horrible.

He wasn’t around for my childhood being a workaholic. Didn’t really interact with him a lot other than at family dinner time (we’re a family of 6; I’m the youngest of 4 kids). All I really witnessed was other members of my family talking down to him for his bad decisions. It seemed like he couldn’t catch a break from them and I felt horrible for him (mostly criticism for his eating habits and how careless he is with money). 


During college I started working on my relationship with him. All of a sudden, I’m having a good relationship with my dad and I’m loving it. He’s teaching me about taxes, telling me about his childhood, all sorts of stuff a father should tell his son. Then the divorce happened. 


I was around 24 at the time. I was the only kid living at the house. It was miserable. He would just smoke weed any chance he got in front of my mom (she hated it) and pretty much do whatever he wanted. At first, I thought it was awesome because I smoke weed, and hey, good for him! He’s doing what he likes. But then I see the blatant disrespect he showed my mom. He would blaze right in front of her. He wouldn’t come home some nights without telling anyone. This caused my mom to wake me up in the middle of the night worried, asking me to call him. They weren’t very good at leaving me out of their drama in the beginning. I’ve put my foot down several times telling them to keep me out of it. Sometimes I still feel guilty about it.


We were all living in a big city growing up. But in the last 5 years, both my sisters moved up north about 6 hours away, my brother and mother have moved to different countries. So it’s only me and him in this city now. And every time I hang out with him, he just frustrates me more and more with his behaviors. Here are some notable things he does:


- Everything he orders at a restaurant is a special order. He rarely even looks at the menu when he goes to a new restaurant, he just hopes they have the ingredients he likes.

- Constantly pestering with texts; I told him I was sick, and he texted me every two hours asking me how I was feeling and if I had a fever. I got about 15 texts from him in a 24 hour period.

- He over complicates everything; I told him my car was having issues so I was taking it to the family mechanic. He then relays all this info 2nd hand to the mechanic, exaggerating everything to make it seem more drastic than it is, just further confusing the mechanic when I show up.

- He hydroplaned, and totaled his car and didn’t tell anyone about it til 6 months later. (Am I crazy, or if you almost die in a car crash, you should tell your family about that?)

- He got admitted to the emergency room for blood clots and I literally got a text from him saying: ”Hey son, just got admitted to the emergency room for blood clots. Don’t worry about me. Should be out in a couple days.” Of course I rushed to the ER when I got that, but who sends a text like that?? TEXT?!?


I understand that his intentions are more good than bad, but his execution, tact, and follow-through are awful. Maybe this is just a part of growing up where you cringe at everything your parents do, but I thought I’d be out of that phase by now (I am with my mom at least). The responsibility of looking after my dad used to be split up between the four kids somewhat. But since everyone has moved away, the burden is now on me, and it’s getting to be very taxing.


I just don’t enjoy spending time with him. But I feel guilty because I’m the only one left in the city, so if I don’t want to see him for a couple weeks, that means he doesn’t seen any family until I’m okay with seeing him again, which makes me feel extremely guilty.


Now it’s at a point where I’m talking to my dad in the same way I saw my other siblings did years ago, and that realization depresses me. It wasn’t my siblings that were seeing him in the wrong light, it was me. The man has problems: financial and emotional. But he doesn’t try to fix them. When I ask him what his plan is, he just says to pray to god, which I think is fucking stupid. God isn’t going to pay your mortgage, bud. I’m 26, just moved out on my own a year ago. I’m in no state to help in any of his issues. I’m barely able to take care of myself. I just feel like I’m experiencing a role reversal, where I have to be constantly looking out for my dad making stupid mistakes.


My dad is a character and I love the guy… I just don’t like him. Everytime we’re together, it just feels more and more like this juice isn’t worth the squeeze and I know it’s only going to get worse with his age.


I don’t know if this was the right sub to go to for this issue. All the other posts I see are about specific actions someone does, and not the general state of relationships… I’m just overwhelmed with guilt that I don’t want to spend time with him. I’ll probably start looking into therapy soon.


Thanks for any and all advice!

She was in school and camp, so she wouldn't be texting me as much or she would text me in the late afternoon until she went to sleep and I complied. But since camp has let out for her, she hasn't hesitated to text me from the moment she wakes up until she goes to sleep (which is about 9:30 every night). 

She wants/expects me to reply to her texts fairly quickly, and if I don't reply for a while she might call me to ask me to text her. The texts are mostly funny or cute pictures relating to things she likes (like Kingdom Hearts, Pokemon, etc.) or “random/simple” texts like blananana, etc. I always text her back what she wants, either a similar funny or cute picture or a simple text. 

Now don't get me wrong, my cousin is a really sweet girl. I know she gets lonely and I'm so flattered and grateful to have someone that looks up to me like that.

29636,Non-Romantic,335n5g,"My boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and are currently starting to think about moving out together. We've been checking out our options (renting, buying etc) and are just weighing up the pros and cons right now, no big rush. 

His mother, who we currently live with, has heard we are thinking of moving out and has suggested we buy her house, to allow her to move to a bungalow as she suffers with mobility issues.

This doesn't sound like the worst idea until you look at the house. My boyfriend and his mother have lived there for 21 years and it hasn't had any major (or minor) works done on it since. The kitchen cabinets are falling apart, it needs a brand new bathroom, which has started accumulating damp, and the whole house needs new carpets and new wallpaper (some rooms have neither) and a full set of new windows and doors. Plus the garden is overgrown and a mess. Basically, the house needs a full refurbishment. And we don't have the money for that kind of work. 

She currently only owns half the property, with a housing association owning the other half (whilst doing nothing for the money they make). The only way she could move out is to sell the half she owns (which I would highly doubt would sell for much money, if at all), or to buy the other half of the property from the housing association and then sell on, with being offered at an obscenely high amount of money, and her having no money. 

With her being disabled and unemployed, she can't get out of the house on her own and sees us as her way of doing this. I do not want to buy this house for the money she deams it worth, knowing all the work and love and effort that would be needed to fix it up. I have spoken to my boyfriend about this, but he sees it as his childhood home and wants to stay there, but he seems blind to the black hole it will be when it comes to money. Plus, he isn't DIY literate at all and we aren't rolling in cash, so the house is likely to stay this way if we took it over. 

This is obviously a cause for arguments, so I wanted opinions on whether I was wrong for not wanting to do this? I feel like I should support him for wanting to stay in his childhood home, but I do feel like his mother is using us as a get out of jail free card so that she doesn't have to deal with the place anymore.

My dad has 3 children. Myself [19F], my little brother [15M], and my deceased older half-sister [35F]. She was a heroin addict who committed suicide, which took a particularly hard toll on myself, and my father (though he won't verbalize it). 


My dad has always been a drinker, but following my sister's suicide in 2010 it has progressed into what I believe is full-blown alcoholism. Beginning at around 5 PM til when he goes to sleep at 8:30-9, my dad is absolutely impossible. He is easily offended, quick to anger, and argumentative. If something upsets my dad when he is drinking, he will blow it entirely out of proportion and there is no reasoning with him. He will explode, saying hurtful things and being what I would consider verbally abusive.


My dad has been through a lot, his mother was Bipolar (as was my sister, as am I) but she was very very Bipolar. When my father was 13 he had to pull her out from the oven she had stuck her head in to kill herself and drive her to the hospital for shock therapy when he didn't even have his driver's license. He has two brothers, one exiled himself to a religious cult and the other one sucks. When his father died, he was left to deal with all of his mother's bills, medical issues, etc. which he resents because she sucked so much as a mother. He lost his daughter to drugs and suicide. I really am such a daddy's girl, I love my dad so much and try so hard to be a good daughter because I know he needs that. 


When my little brother complains about my dad's drinking problem (my dad will be a dick to him for no reason when he's drunk, and my brother will come to me) I try to justify it and explain that my dad has dealt with a lot of shit and we need to be more understanding.

29647,Non-Romantic,2zmhnp,"This is almost an r/personalfinance question.

My wife recently found some work after a number of months unemployed and before that employed only part-time.

Somewhere along the way, she got her heart set on a vacation that would be a real treat for the whole family, especially our son. The problem is, it's across the country and the timeframe is set. Plane tickets alone for all 3 of us would be, cheapest, a little over $1k ... lodging, food, tickets and souvenirs there would probably double that.

$2k seems generally pretty reasonable for a large cross-country family vacation for 3, and I understand the value in taking the time as a family to do something we all could enjoy.

The problems are:

1. Between her months of unemployment, years prior working part-time, and an unemployment situation of my own just a few years ago our emergency budget is practically entirely gone.

2. We have only one car. She is taking the bus as it stands, but summers get hot, and the car I use is about to lose its AC I suspect.

3. The student loan situation. They are in income-based repayment, so they are not a dreadful burden, but they may be once the loan servicer learns of the new income. 

I get that we have to live our lives to some extent, but I really think spending so much on a vacation will put us in an unnecessarily precarious position, and there are other vacations we could take closer to $500 and still very much enjoy. When I voiced that to her though, she baulked and said she and my son could go without me to save money.

Of course the difference between the two would be substantial, but I feel like she kind of missed the point. Like the choice wasn't whether or not to go, or what alternatives are there, but whether or not I went, which ... I'll add ... was pretty insulting and hurtful.

Push come to shove, we're all but broke. We could *technically* swing the trip, but it would leave us as financially vulnerable at the end of the summer as we are now at the end of a number of months of her unemployment.

However, she is just determined.

She knows the finances, and sees we could swing it, but I feel like if we go and we're afraid of spending money it won't be very much fun ... and if something costly happened that needed quick cash, we'd have to go beg parents or something. Not where I want to be at all if I have a choice. If they go without me, I will definitely feel sleighted, and we'll be almost just as broke at the end of the day.

I feel like this is a time to put my foot down, but I am just taken aback by how shortsighted she is being, and we normally have a pretty easy time of financial decisions.

I think that because she's now earning again, she feels entitled to more power in financial decision-making, but it's always been pretty even. It's not like her lack of income has made her opinion matter any less in the past, I don't think her income should make it matter more now.

It's really hard not to get emotionally wrapped up though, because she keeps going back to you don't have to go as a part-solution/compromise and pointing to the enjoyment of our child, rather than looking at the whole situation.

It's especially frustrating knowing that her unemployment is the most immediate reason we're broke, that we've put off all kinds of other spending through her time as a student and unemployed (car, mattresses, loans, etc), that we'll have to keep putting off for this vacation. 

I feel like no matter how I spin this, though, to the family I'm the asshole.

I feel she is being immature and irresponsible, but she keeps couching it in It will be so fun for our kid. and We have to live our lives, and vacations are a part of that. and We're used to finances being tight, everything will be fine.

Meanwhile all I have is this balance sheet and awareness of our needs.

Do I say: We'll find a way to make it work.  or No. We simply can't afford it. I'm sorry. and duke it out from there?

29649,Non-Romantic,2kv2ab,"Hi all. This may be a long post so bear with me. I've been feeling like I need help for weeks but I haven't reached out to anyone, and I felt like this was my best option.

Basically I'm a recent college grad with my first professional job. When I was in college I held a position in my field, and I loved it. I got along well with all my coworkers (even though most were older than me) and they respected me and we, for the most part, got along well. I really respected my boss and looked up to him because he was really good at his job, and in return he'd tell me I did a good job and appreciated my help.

On a more personal note hearing that from time to time was really important to me because I am a workaholic and a perfectionist, so I felt like I was earning my keep in this world by doing a good job.
As I was preparing to graduate I wanted to work closer to my BF who is in grad school in a different state from our home state, so I applied for a job as a manager (my old boss's position) in the same field and I got it! I was so excited to continue to do work I am so passionate about and to be closer to my BF. At the time it seemed perfect.
The longer I've been here though, the more lost I've felt. I deal with depression, anxiety, ADHD (to name a few) and I thought that starting a job and being done with school would help, but it's been even tougher since I got here. My BF is perfectly content with only interacting with his fellow grad students for socializing, but I was a very social person and still am at heart. Because I work long, sometimes 12-13 hour days and sometimes 6 days a week I don't have time to make friends and I don't know how to. In the past my friends were from school or work, but I can't really do that anymore (and I'll explain why shortly). So I feel lonely all the time.

Also my work situation makes it hard for me to make friends. All the professional staff are older than me (my coworker with the same title is 28, our boss is 30, and everyone else is older) and those below us are college students. While I am closer in age to them they're very different from me. They listen to rap music I don't really like (No Flex Zone is their favorite and they play it every night) and they like to go out and party and drink most nights. While I think that's fine and they can do what they'd like, I feel like I can't relate to them because when I was in college I was taking 20 credits and commuting 30 minutes - an hour and working as much as I could to support myself. I didn't have time to party. I would hang out with friends, but really only the weekends. 

My coworker with the same title (M, 28) and my boss (M, 30) have A LOT in common with them though. They both graduated from the same college as these students and had the same type of student life. My boss used to have my position so they've worked under him for years. They like him because he's charismatic, funny, knows his stuff, and they know they can rely on him.

I don't have a good relationship with my current boss like my old boss. I respect this guy a lot - he's smart and he knows all about the job, but I don't really think he cares if I'm around or not. He wants to distance himself because he wants my coworker with the same title and I to be a team. So I tried, but my coworker (we'll call C) doesn't do as much of the behind the scenes work that I do and he doesn't really say anything. He also just doesn't seem to care about the job. He also does things that upset me.
For instance,  he got mad at me for sending out a certain email too soon and asked if we could wait 24 hours so I said fine (even though the template email our boss sent us suggested it was to be sent immediately, but I said fine) and then a week later he sends the same type of email our right away and then sends a followup email saying oh sorry disregard that email I shouldn't have sent it out because of X reason (and a reason only he knew and didn’t share with anyone else).

C never communicates with me. And when I try to talk to him he completely ignores what I say. We were running shift the two of us and a lot of people weren't doing their job because they were taking pictures instead, and I said to him hey, shouldn't we get them back to work? Couldn't they take pictures after shift? And he yelled at me and said that they don't have to stay later and it was fine. About an hour later our boss showed up and yelled at us both because people were taking pictures instead of working and that they could stay after if they wanted to take pictures.
And that's just one example. I feel like no one cares about my opinions or thoughts so I don't say them because I feel really worthless and like I don't matter. 

So that on top of the fact that I am a visual person and would rather get emails than be talked to (most of the time) so I can remember and make a game plan for myself. Because he doesn’t listen to me, I've started to email my coworker things instead of talking to him, because then at least I get to say what I need without being cut off. I kind of got into the habit of doing this with everyone because I'm already pretty isolated because of where my office is, and everyone cuts me off and talks over me or ignores what I say. 
I know I’m not an expert, and I really look to my coworker and those directly below us for support, but half the time they say, “Oh, I want this to happen” so I do it and then they complain and say “I only want that in this situation, not this one”. So I know we mainly have communication issues.

I feel like this is getting pretty rambly, but in essence I feel like I don’t belong and like I am a shitty person. My old boss and his boss both said I would be perfect for this type of job and really seemed to like me, but I feel like I am failing here even though I try very, very hard. Most nights I come home and cry because all I want is to be good at my job and obviously I suck.
No one asks me what I’d like or what I need, and maybe at this point I don’t deserve it. I just hate it that my coworker, who doesn’t do as much as doesn’t seem to care, is better liked because he does nothing and when I try to help I’m doing it all wrong. I feel like they would be better off if I quit. But really what I would like is to get along with my coworkers and work as a team. I just don’t know what to do from here.

But then for some reason he changed, he suddenly started acting like a total jerk to my family. One thing is he's been really selfish with my sister, and their relationship is pretty bad. He always complains that she sits around texting when she actually helps my mom clean around the house, while he does nothing.

I don't understand why he's been treating my sister this way.

My dad has also been giving me a hard time. When I have to drive him somewhere to run an errand, he's always criticizing my driving and how I'm terrible at it, yet he doesn't put an effort to go to the DMV to get his permit to have a driving license to get a job.

He has also promised my family that he wouldn't drink again and broke that promise 2 weeks ago, when he decided to drink with his cousins.

He's been treating us like this for months now and I don't know what to do, he's always calling my family lazy and doesn't put effort in looking for a job. Because of this, he's been having constant arguments with my mom. I don't want him to argue with her anymore. I've had enough.

29655,Non-Romantic,2nun54,"This happened a few days ago but it has been playing on my mind. Just going to provide some background to this as I think might help understand the situation. I’m on the track team for my college and I am on a partial athletic scholarship so it is something I take pretty seriously. I have recently been struggling with an injury and during this time I have been spending a lot of time with my assistant coach - he has been helping me keep fit. We get along very well, he is fun guy to be around and not intimidating like my head coach.


I was at practice last week and was hopeful that my injury was gone. Well anyway I tried to do some drills and it was clear that my leg was not okay. I was really pissed and disappointed as I thought things were getting better so I just went back to the locker room. I wasn’t crying but I was feeling emotional and frustrated about it all.  My assistant coach came in and I have never seen him in the female locker room before (not even sure if he really allowed in there). 



He sat next to me and I was venting my frustration when he started rubbing my thigh. At the time I didn’t really think much of it because my mind was in other places and I was feeling so emotional I lent my head on his shoulders. We sat like this for a while as I kept talking and he was trying to calm me down. I find it hard to describe what he did next but he like started touching my face and stroking my hair and I didn’t do anything to stop him. Someone then came in, he leapt away from me and nothing further happened.


Looking back on it now it all seems a bit weird but I don’t know if I’m reading too much into this. I can’t really decide if he was just consoling me because I was being emotional or if he was trying something more. I know I did nothing to stop anything and sort of encouraged him by leaning my head on him. Maybe he was trying to be nice, I don’t know, but all the touching (especially the thigh thing) made it feel like more than that. Also what happened probably would be classed as inappropriate as my school is super strict about athlete-coach relationships. 


I also don’t know whether I should tell my boyfriend about it. We have been together about a year and have a really great relationship - he is someone I usually feel I can tell anything but I have never been in a situation like this before.  Nothing really happened but I do feel a bit bad about it and if he had tried anything further I honestly don’t know what I would have done and it freaks me out a little. I haven’t seen my boyfriend or my coach since it happened because of the holiday and the more I think about it the more I get stressed about it all.


I just need advice as to whether I am over thinking the whole situation and if it was inappropriate. And is it something I should tell my boyfriend about?

29699,Non-Romantic,2yn1jp,"My dad always tended to have somewhat adolescent and unfortunately pretty abusive relationships with women. When I was ~11 he met someone who was pretty horrible to me. She would blame her marital problems on me, tell me that I was going to go to hell (this was an evangelical Christian household- I am no longer religious), and try to restrict my academic opportunities because her sons weren't presented the same options (I was attending college courses when I was 12 - long story).


When I was 13 I was sexually abused by my step-brother for about a year. I had pretty severe OCD and it was extremely traumatic. I told my father and he did not believe me. He was told by a social worker he would lose custody of me if I remained in the house where the abuse was occurring. I became clinically depressed. I left for college when I was 16 and was not emotionally prepared for it, I wrestled with huge emotional issues which I now see as the result of abuse.


When I was 18, I heard from my father that he now believed me. When I asked him to expand he said that my other step-brother had been raped for years by HIS brother (the same one who had abused me). It is difficult for me to deal with the fact that not only was my abuser much closer to my father than I was to him, but also that my story was only taken seriously after his brother corroborated it with his own incredibly tragic experience.


I saw my father a few times in the intervening years. He would do things like take me to the house where I was abused to clean (???) after not seeing me for months. He would also insist on bringing my step-mother who very explicitly blames me for her son's lack of success (I believe he is now in prison but I'm not sure). 


Fast forward to these last couple of years. I am doing extremely well in my career. I feel like i have addressed many of the issues that I wrestled with, but it would be hubris to say they no longer play a role in my life.


My father is getting older. He expects a lot of time and attention from me suddenly. He is more respectful of my boundaries but I still often get the feeling that he is bored or (as he has said many times before) feels like I'm bragging when I talk about my life. Perhaps part of me does brag- I'm sure I'm trying to prove something to myself by proving to him that I am doing well. However, on another level I see what I am doing as fairly normal and his response to it as pretty narcissistic. 


I guess the way I have reconciled what happened to me is that I had someone who was too immature and too emotionally restricted to be a good father. He was a mediocre father. He, however, was put in a situation that demanded a great father and he failed. I don't think he's a bad person and i don't think the situation he was in (leaving his new family for his old family) was an easy one.

29700,Non-Romantic,34z6nw,"I have been working at my job for a little over 2 years now. My boss &amp; I have always had mostly a good relationship with each other. Regardless of the fact that he is VERY unprofessional (dodges phone calls, ignores vendors requests for money, makes racial and sexual comments towards employees, etc.) I continued to stay loyal to him and look past his unacceptable behavior because the pay is decent and I'm not managed by anyone but myself.

About 6 months ago, I began to plan a road trip around the US that would last about 6-12 months. This required me to quit my job, so I started saving as much as I could and I finally gave my boss resignation notice. I gave him notice on April 20th, that my last day would be May 22nd. 


I realized I had 10 unused vacation days which I would obviously like to use before I go. I gave him MORE than a month's advance notice that I was leaving, and I asked him if it would be okay for me to take the vacation days before I left and be paid for them. He verbally said yes but I wanted to get it in writing.  My coworker said in the past, a former employee had a similar situation in which my boss verbally agreed to pay him and the guy took the time off, but then my boss ended up not paying the guy because the guy couldn't prove that he was told he would be paid. 

 Therefore, I sent him this email this morning:

From what I understand from our short discussion yesterday regarding my vacation time, I believe you said  I have the days, so I can take them off. 
If that is correct, I would like to take off this Thursday &amp; Friday May 7th &amp; 8th, next Thursday &amp; Friday May 14th &amp; 15th, and the entire week of May 18th – 22nd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
That is a total of 9 days.
Therefore May 13th would be my last working day and May 22nd would be my last paid day. 
I would like to have this in writing that this is approved and that I will be paid for all days not in the office. 

If you would prefer for me to be in the office the last week, I will gladly do so however request that I do get paid for vacation days unused. I don’t mean to be a hassle about these days, however the time and money is very valuable to me and I feel as if I am deserving of them. 


An hour after sending him the email, the controller at my company told me that my boss forwarded him my email and wrote WTF????? above it as if to say is she serious? 

Is it wrong of me to try to fight for these paid days off? It would just be the right thing to do after everything I've done for this company over the past 2 years. Not only have I gone above and beyond for him as an employee, but I have also done a number of personal favors for him like driving his car to the dealership, selling his things on eBay, listing his cars on craigslist, etc. He's acting like I'm being unreasonable or something which I'm not at all. All he does is take advantage of his employees and throw all the favors that we do for him back in our faces. He is honeslty the most unprofessional and assanine man I have ever met in my entire life. He has been in his office the entire day with the door shut and every time I go to speak to him, he tells me he can't talk to me and that he's caught up with something else. He's walked by my desk once or twice throughout the day and didn't even look at me, and when I got up to follow him to his office once again to speak with him, he shut the door on me.

So basically what I'm trying to ask is - is what I'm asking unreasonable? Am I technically entitled to these vacation days or do I just have to accept that he isn't going to pay me? I know legally that he doesn't have to pay me out on my last paycheck, but is he legally allowed to deny me these days?

I work in a high end senior living facility. I'm really worried about my boss. We all know he is a recovering addict and goes to weekly meetings. He is the manager I am the assistant manager. He had been sober 3 years up until a few months ago when his boyfriend left him. I asked him if he was ok told him to talk regularly to his sponsor and pick up sine extra meetings if he needed to. (I struggled with opiate abuse and I've been clean over 5years now so I know how the program works) he promised he would and that he was doing okay. Cut to the next week he misses 4days of work then shows up wasted. I hugged him and he cried and told me he wasn't doing good and that he needed help. He told me to go get our director of services and another member of our staff he goes to AA with regularly. I did they finally made the decision to put him on leave and send him to rehab. Skip to a week into rehab he breaks out at 1AM and ends up at our directors house crying saying he is fine he can do this but he can't stay in rehab he is worried about his job. The director called me because he has his own wife and family and can't deal with that at 1AM ... We got a hold of his sponsor and he got him. They had a meeting with our executive director and decided to let him come back to work on a lot of rules and intureum basis with me over seeing him. He had to attend his weekly meetings and keep an 11am-7pm schedule.

This lead to me picking up A LOT of his slack. I went from working 36-40hour weeks to 50-60 hour weeks. I have a 2 year old and I'm a single mom this has been really hard on me but my boss seemed to be doing really well. Cut to about 3-4 weeks ago and I start noticing he's been really off. Just SUPER hyped up(he's always hyper but not this bad) starts bringing in bags upon bags of candy to work and buying random shit on the company card. He started slacking off on the little bit of work he is allowed to do and I started having to fix his mistakes. He has started messing up schedules and invoices...ordering wrong things or 5 cases of diet coke but no lemonade. Just little things. Then I noticed him falling asleep at the computer and he lost at leased 40-50lbs probably more. He started looked gray and ashen his eyes sunk in. At first I thought pills but now I'm thinking it's more. He is always sweating profusely and complaint it's hot when i have to wear a light jacket and I'm shivering. I've noticed him stealing random things and taking them home (decorations and stuff). He's always up and down.

We've got been in cooperate training with our director of services the past 3 days and he slept or texted through most of it. He ended up failing his training and pissed the guy from cooperate off and embarrassed our director. We have a rap for being the number one of 15 different communities on the east coast.

I don't know what to do and I'm getting stretched to thin. I want to help him but when I try to talk to him or ask him what he is using he laughs and says nothing he's fine. He is in trouble right now for asking a worker where to find drugs and he doesn't even remember the conversation with the guy but I was right there and heard the whole thing.

I don't know if I should go to our boss or what. I don't know what he is using but I know it's something and EVERYONE is starting to notice. I don't want to ruin this guy's life by him losing his job but I want him to get help. I'm so torn.

TL;DR- pretty sure my addict boss is super off the wagon and is failing miserably at all things job related.

29705,Non-Romantic,3gyhw6,"I overheard my sister instructing my niece not to talk to me or be my friend just over a week ago, and I would really like to ask her about it.


I overheard the conversation through my bedroom window. My sister told Alice (who is four) that I was very nasty and rude. That I was bad, naughty etc, and that Alice shouldn't talk to me. Then she said I don't want you to be her friend, and then again you shouldn't be her friend.


Alice forgot to not be my friend almost instantly. But before that there was a couple of awkward hours of her glaring holes into the side of my head, refusing to talk to me, usual stroppy kid shit. But then she got told off by her grandmother for being rude to me and got a time-out and afterwards would not leave my lap.


But I'm not concerned about her ignoring me for a couple of hours. She's four. She has strops, she blanks me when I don't give her juice, she gets over it. I'm more concerned about my sister outright telling her that she shouldn't talk to me, which I feel is... a little bit weird? It was her tone of voice and the way she framed the questions she's not nice, is she? you shouldn't talk to her, should you? 


I can't think why she would ban Alice from talking to me for parental reasons. I'm like the daycare of the family, my nieces and nephews are like a second set of siblings. I don't swear in front of any of my nieces or nephews, I don't raise my voice in anger, I don't smoke in the house at all when they're here, and I don't speak harshly to their parents in front of them.  And I spend upwards of four hours daily looking after Alice and keeping her out from underfoot whilst my sister helps my mum with chores and errands and catches up. Since I was sixteen I've been the go-to babysitter of the family. Definitely not a bad influence, I think?


Over the past week it hasn't been as explicit but I feel paranoid. If Alice is sitting on my lap, she calls her over. If I talk to Alice, she talks over me and she herds her away from me with a number of excuses (grandma wants you, come here and watch this video I've got a secret to tell you!) She also encourages Alice to tell me to shut up, and call me names (though the names are silly and cute like smelly or whatever, but the encouragement is really strong and obvious)


It's weird. It's really weird. And petty. I don't want to get dragged into some silly competition for a four year olds attention. She still expects me to cook Alice's dinner, mind. 


You can probably guess that my sister and I have a very bad relationship. She bullied me a lot when I was a child, but I gave it back much worse as I got older. I don't feel like I can adequately describe the relationship without going off on lots of aimless tangents about all the nasty fights and arguments over the years-- I don't think I can remember a time we were ever even close to friends. 


So suffice it to say there's a lot of pettiness on both sides BUT we both make tremendous efforts to be civil to each other in front of her daughter (Alice). We don't act fake and friendly, but we're never bitchy in front of Alice, and we don't argue. When I'm not needed as babysitter I retreat to my old room until she's gone.


I don't know if I am justified in asking her to not say stuff like that to Alice, but my feelings are quite hurt. Also Alice isn't MY kid, so I don't think I have a say in how she's raised


If I should I don't know how to go about it as mum and kid are never apart. Whatever discussion we have will turn into a vicious argument (loud on her part, nasty on mine) and I really don't want her kid to witness it. I told my mum about it but she's very protective of my sister (who's pretty much the butt of most jokes in the family) and has told me to ignore it. 


But I'm still quite upset even after a week of it, and I feel very stressed in her presence. I've helped raise Alice since the day she was born and whilst I don't expect my sister to like me I do think I deserve more respect than that. So, how do I get my sister to somewhere we can chat privately? What do I say?

I use the bus to get around. I have a part-time minimum wage job and I could probably afford a car if I invested like 90% of my salary but there's no point. I walk to my job and use the bus when I go out. I simply don't need one.

29728,Non-Romantic,1vqewk,"This got long so I've renamed the people involved for ease of reading.

I've known this guy almost 8 years now. As title, I'm 25 and he's 23. I'll call him Alan. We've been through a lot together in this relatively short time and I'm usually proud to say he's my best friend. He's like a brother to me.

My exgirlfriend was 22, and I was with her for 1.5 years. I'll call her ExSadie (the ex part just to make it clear which girl is the ex and which is not).

I broke up with ExSadie a month and a half ago. Our relationship was great, and she was great, but not really to be. She didn't really do anything wrong, but a long time female friend of mine at the time - who I have known for 10 years and always liked, but always ultimately rejected me - finally told me her feelings towards me had changed, and that she wanted to take the plunge be with me. I'll call her Lyn. Due to my feelings for Lyn that I couldn't ignore, I broke up with ExSadie for Lyn. 

Lyn and I are now together, dating and taking things slow pretty much since the night I broke up with ExSadie.

I always knew my best friend Alan liked ExSadie. When I got with her and I introduced them, he got to know her and was eventually raving about how great she was, and how great she was for me. They grew pretty close (nothing suspicious, he's extremely gay and as far from interested in women as you can get). Of course at the time, this was great. ExSadie and Alan got on so well, it made it easy to divide my time between them because they were always cool about each other and also hang out with them both simultaneously. And I just really liked my girlfriend and my friend getting on.

I broke up with ExSadie and confirmed my new relationship with Lyn pretty quickly, as such both of these things happened before I had a chance to tell Alan about the whole situation. Alan knew how I always felt for Lyn, but the subject hadn't come up for a couple of years. I actually thought he would be pleased for me, he likes Lyn too (and they have also known each other for years) and knew how much my feelings for her had tormented me at times when they were unrequited, but his reaction was extremely negative.

He's being completely unsupportive of my choice. Almost every time we speak or hang out, he brings up what an idiot I am for breaking up with ExSadie. He is also attempting to undermine my new relationship with Lyn saying various things. Sometimes he gets downright pissed at me about it. He keeps going on about how ExSadie was perfect for me, that I'm blind about Lyn, all this nonsense. Telling me how I treated ExSadie badly and that I'll 'regret it' (I NEVER cheated on ExSadie with Lyn, or anything like that. Everything happened after I broke up with her, apart from that one initial conversation Lyn and I had about our feelings)

At first I thought it was because he was annoyed that he wouldn't be hanging out with ExSadie anymore, but I told him that I'm perfectly fine if they do. And so they have been. But that didn't change anything, he's telling me it's nothing to do with that, just 'what an idiot' I've been. I ask him how ExSadie is doing, just out of politeness, and he tells me that I 'don't deserve to know'. 

He's still a friend, we still talk and hang out as much as we ever did and it's not like this is ALL he speaks about, but he does bring it up pretty predictably at some point in any conversation we have.

I've already asked him to lay off, but he wont. He's treating Lyn differently too now. Before he was really friendly with her in our social group but now he ignores her. Fortunately she doesn't seem to notice, as far as she's concerned everythings fine and it's not affecting us so that's one good thing, but I do notice.. and between me and Alan, it's not fine.

It's really bugging me. He wont listen to me when I tell him to stop this bullshit. I don't want to break off a friendship because of this, especially not ours, but it's starting to look like the only way I'll be getting some peace. 

I'm looking for some advice or insight on what to do about this, although it feels pretty good to get it all off my chest too.

As I was growing up I saved money that I received from my parents and grandparents in a wallet in my room. I had upwards of $400 at one point. One day, my wallet went missing with about $300 in it. I figured I had just lost it in my room, and over the course of about a year I periodically searched my room for the wallet, hoping it'd turn up.

One day, my mom was searching my brother's room(while he was there, and I was in my room) for whatever reason, and she found my wallet. Completely empty. He had stolen my wallet from my room and spent all of the $300 on weed. From that day forward I vowed to never forgive him and my hatred for his has only grown.

He is an absolutely disgusting human being inside and out. He used to wipe his ass with socks and leave them in his room. He goes weeks or months without showering, and when he does shower he puts on the same clothes he was wearing before, which are stained with unknown substances(probably food, he is overweight) and covered in pet hair. He smells of armpit must all the time, and the smell lingers after he's gone for several minutes.

He doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom, when he does use the bathroom he leaves poop in the toilet. I want to stress that this is one of the worst things. Every single day, I get up and have to use the bathroom, but I don't want to because I know there will be shit in the toilet and possibly dirt from his testicles on the toilet seat.

He smokes weed in his room and sometimes the smell permeates mine, and I absolutely hate the smell of marijuana. Whenever the door of his room is left even slightly ajar, the smell of weed will fill the entire hallway where our rooms are until the door is closed and then some.

Because he goes weeks without showering and hardly ever washes his hands, I can't directly touch anything in the house(guess I'm a slight germaphobe, but anyone who sees him would not want to touch anything he touches either). Everything is crusted with dirt or grease and so I have to find workarounds to opening essential things like the cabinet or fridge without having to wash my hands every time. It's extremely frustrating.

I cry and plead with my parents almost every single day, but they refuse to do anything about him. He flunked high school and since then held a part time job for a couple months. Now, he sits in the house all day playing video games and eating. He will not be doing anything with his life anytime soon and will probably live with my parents until they pass away. I used to do school from home, and it is now summer so I have to spend all day with him(I have no friends to hang out with, not exaggerating either). 

This has made every day life unnecessarily difficult to live. To the where I am extremely depressed, stressed, and at times suicidal. I feel like this is all because of him. The sight of him is repulsing. It pisses me off so much that he lives perfectly fine, he's fine with looking like, smelling like, and acting like a piece of shit and I just have to live with it. My parents don't consider how I feel.

 I turn 18 in about 4 months, but I've never had a job(I've applied to many but am not very outgoing) and I have no money. I'm not going to go to a university out of  high school due to cost(going to community college first then transferring). So I'm pretty much out of options except to live with it until I can save enough money to move out or until I go to a university. It could be as much as 3 years. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I'm not kidding when I say every day is hell. Every. Single. Day. It's the same shit. And it never changes. 

Please do not suggest I try to talk to him or something, he is an absolute savage human being and is actually quite stupid. He knows what he does and how it makes me feel, he doesn't care. I don't even know why I'm typing this. I don't know what advice you guys could give me. I appreciate you listening nonetheless.

As an aside, I also have 2 other brothers but they do not live at home, so it's just me, my brother, my parents, and a couple other irrelevant people.

If I left anything out, feel free to ask questions.

29749,Non-Romantic,20n8yx,"This may end up being more like a rant, but I'd like some general advice on my ongoing situation.

I grew up in a heavily Christian home and was raised in a heavily Christian conservative family. I attended Christian school from preschool through junior high and was brought to church my whole life. My family is very loving and my parents raised me to be kind and respectful, and I like to think I'm a nice all-around guy. Never got into drugs or alcohol or anything, I graduated high school and I'm currently in college studying to be a social worker. I work part time to make enough to support a car and my basic necessities, but I live at home and most of the big bills (for example rent and food and all that) are covered by my parents who are happy to let me stay. My parents have been divorced for 7 years and I continue to go back and forth between houses at my own convenience just to keep everybody happy.

The problem is that over the past year or so, my beliefs have changed quite a bit and to my knowledge no one in my family knows it. I haven't been to church in over a year and my religious beliefs have shifted more towards the atheist side, though I wouldn't say they're there completely. My views on sex and dating and a lot of that have changed a lot. I lost my virginity to my first (now ex) girlfriend over a year ago and my current girlfriend of 9 months and I have sex on a fairly regular basis. Because we both work morning/evening jobs the majority of free time we have for each other is later at night. We'll do our thing and I'll head home anywhere from 1-4 in the morning. My parents don't particularly care for it but I think have realized it isn't going to stop, so they don't say much about it anymore. Lately I've gotten into the habit of staying the night with her at her house where she lives with her family and coming home later in the late morning hours. My mother doesn't seem to mind, but my dad doesn't want me doing it anymore, he thinks I'll get myself into trouble.

Moving out isn't quite an option yet, though I do have a few people that are desparate for me to room with them. My mother threatened to cut me off financially if I moved out, and I haven't even bothered asking my dad because moving in with someone who isn't your wife is highly frowned upon by my conservative family. My family would think of me as some sinner if I told them any of this.

I guess I just feel like my family is holding me down and trying to smother me with their ways of doing things and their beliefs, and I'm getting tired of having to hide the way my life is from them and put on a show constantly to keep them happy. I have a very judgmental family so any way I try to escape from it would more than likely lead to me alienating some member or members of my family and the rest would look down on me for how I feel. I love and respect my family and all that they've done for me but I feel like I'm in limbo between trying to live my own life my way and trying to keep everyone in the family happy. One day I feel like there's going to be a confrontation that's going to cause me to lose some family members and I don't want that to happen.

TL;DR: Family is heavily conservative and Christian, and my beliefs don't match up with theirs anymore. I want to live my own life my way but I also respect my family enough to not want to alienate them by breaking out of the rut I'm stuck in if that makes any sense.

29753,Non-Romantic,2dqfu8,"This may be long, so I apologize in advance, I am just not sure how to go about the situation anymore.

Backstory - Me [25/F] and my ex recently broke up, so our apartment lease was up, and because of the type of work I do I didn't want to find an apartment right away.  I asked my father [51] if I could stay with him temporarily, to which he was SUPER hesitant about, but when I told him my cats wouldn't be coming he finally agreed.  My mom is working abroad right now, so staying with her temporarily was out of the question.  

I have not lived/depended on my father for anything in the last ten years.  This is the first time I have turned to him for help, and by the second I am regretting the situation tremendously.

Growing up, my father was severely emotionally abusive to both my mother and I (hence, they are no longer together - and she unfortunately still deals with backlash from the abuse years later.)  Since I hadn't lived with my dad, the abuse was lessened since I didn't see him as regularly, so when I did see him, the majority of the time it was pleasant enough (for the most part) - however, I can still write a novel of things that were said towards me that a parent shouldn't say.

Fast forward to now, I have been back at my dads for ~3 months now.  EVERY SINGLE DAY I am here, there are malicious comments thrown my way.  I have spoken to my mother about the situation (she wonders if perhaps seeing me reminds my father of my mother since we look/act alike, because of how irrational/malicious/unwarranted his comments are - but I think it goes deeper than that.)

Examples: 

* yells at me if I have left an empty water bottle on the floor of my room - even though I refill them so that I have less of an ecological footprint.  
* I am still madly in love with my ex and have been depressed because of our situation.  I will shut my room door and cry - he will yell at me from downstairs to STFU - to which when I go downstairs he then berates me for feeling this way, and swears at me more telling me I need to get the f*ck over it and move on - even though he has not once asked me what has happened/why I'm feeling this way, etc...
* yells/swears at me if HIS dishes aren't put into the dishwasher that he just used
* constantly putting me down - especially because I am not working, I do contract accounting work in the film industry.  He was married to my mother who is a Production Accountant, he knows how our industry works, but still puts me down that I am between shows.
* constantly refers to me/other people as f*ckers/c*cksuckers - it is just vulgar, disgusting and completely unnecessary to address other people like that.
* there is so much more, but typing this is already making my heart hurt so much.

My ex is out of town right now, and because the cats are living with him, I am staying at his apartment since it allows me to be away from the toxic air at my dads and it allows me to spend time with my cats.  I will be there for the week, after that I plan on staying with my mothers boyfriend.  I have not told my father of these plans, but I plan on addressing him today and letting him know, however, I'm not sure how to approach the subject.

Last week I sent him a text telling him how difficult of a time I am having in my life right now (I suffer from depression, but I seem to be able to maintain it well, but with everything from work/ex/father I am not doing well) so I explained this in a mature way and how his words of tearing me apart every chance he gets really do not help.  He said, if ever I needed to talk to him he was there and that he loved me very much.  I noticed he watched what he said in front of me, but that lasted one day.

I am at my wit's end with him.  As I said, I have not depended/needed anything from my dad in the last ten years, this is the first time, and every day he makes snippets about how I'm in the house.  His emotional abuse is really getting to me.  He does not treat my [22] brother the way he treats me at all - they are best friends, he high fives him when he gets laid, they joke about hot women together, they drink together etc... I CHOOSE to have a relationship with my dad, and I thought by moving in with him it would bring us together, but I think it's separated us even further than we already were.  I'm just not sure what to do.  I'm not even sure what I'm asking.  I tried looking for books on abuse from a parent at my local Chapters but couldn't find any.  I want a relationship with my dad, but it comes with way too much baggage and I'm just afraid I'm going to cut ties with him because he doesn't get the pain that he causes to others/ESPECIALLY me.  How do I approach him so that my fear doesn't become a reality?

I'm sorry this is long, I guess I also needed to vent, I just am not sure who to turn to in person for advice.

29769,Non-Romantic,3fc6ed,"About three months ago, I set my best friend George up with a casual, friendly acquaintance of mine, Mary. I assumed they liked each other, George would bring her up often when we were hanging out and said he thought she was cool. I had one class with Mary and she'd often talk about being on the forensics team with George when I mentioned he was my best friend from, like, elementary school. When George asked me who to ask to the end of the year forensics banquet, I suggested Mary and told him that I thought both of them seemed interested in each other and that they would be a good couple. They hit it off, and George apparently told Mary I was the reason he got enough confidence to ask her out. Great, right?

Wrong.

Ever since then Mary has been blowing up my phone about George. She has never dated anyone before, and she's inexperienced, and I get that. But I feel weird and uncomfortable when she asks me how to kiss him, and what their latest makeout session was like, and how bad/good he is at certain things. She even sent me screenshots of a conversation she had with his ex girlfriend from 6 months ago in which his ex was talking about how she gave George a bj and Mary asked me if I know if this is true and it happened. George did in fact bring it up with me because he was not into it and the girl basically forced herself on him, and it was an uncomfortable and bad situation that he trusted me enough to tell me about.

Otherwise, she sends me literally like 10 screenshots in a row to show me how cute George is being or how he's got game. Literally 2 weeks ago my boyfriend of 8 months broke up with me (he's leaving for college and I still have a year of hs) and I am still kinda feeling bad about it. She knows about this, but continues sending me George's cute texts which feel like she's rubbing the fact that she has a relationship and I'm single after my first serious relationship in my face.

I am in grad school and moved into an on-campus apartment building over a month ago. We have a 2-bedroom 1-bath apartment (2 girls to a bedroom, 4 total) in a mostly-graduate building. My roommate is an undergrad, though, but she is older than the rest of us. This is my first time living on campus/with others as it was cheaper for me to live with my parents in undergrad. I am not sure where she lived during the rest of her undergrad but I know it wasn't on a campus. As such I would like a little advice on this subject.

Like many of you, I enjoy my time on my computer. I have a laptop, however it is treated like a desktop: I have a much larger monitor, an external keyboard, and a 5 button mouse. I have used this setup all my life dating back to our old XP desktop - I have had about 5 mice total since XP came out and probably 2 keyboards (when one breaks I furiously hunt for it despite the fact it's 10 years old). I am very much a creature of habit, but I always use headphones when listening to music and keep my side of the room cleanly/organized. 

I am in a writing/producing program. Almost all of my homework is writing, or reading something on my computer and posting comments, or just plain watching film/television - which I do via my laptop's screen, and my monitor is for miscellaneous. We do not have a TV in the room so I can only stream shows and some of my HW involves watching a show and writing down the plot in detail. I also do a lot of creative writing practices on my own - theorizing characters/plots and I have a trusted friend I bounce my ideas off to. In my free time I am surfing the web/chatting with people I know online - I have been in an IRC community for YEARS, many of them I play online games like League of Legends and DOTA2 with. These games are heavy keyboard masher games and require a lot of clicking to navigate my character, if you have never played. 

Please note that my laptop's keyboard is, IMO and the opinion of a friend who I had come sound check, about the same degree of loudness as my external keyboard. I do NOT like using the laptop keyboard as I very often miss keys/pressing them doesn't register, but I bought it solely for the hardware with the intent to almost never use its keyboard or trackpad (it is a touch screen but I was not looking for that feature) as I have my setup and it sits like a desktop tower most of the time. I will refuse to use it for homework if I am in the room - I take it with me to writer workshops but I have to revise on my main keyboard for the numerous typos made.

A couple weeks in to living on campus together, my roommate pointed out she has a very difficult time studying/reading her textbooks around the noise my keyboard and mouse make when I use them - typing/clicking the mouse. My desk was, at the time, right between our beds due to the room layout, so her head was always next to mine if she read in bed, which she says is her habit and comfortable for her. We changed desks so I am at the foot of her bed and my desk's board cuts us off. We also have an AC machine right next to her head and she bought noise canceling headphones to drown out the noise, as she requires a very intense level of silence. I suggested she just use regular headphones and put on music at first, but she says she cannot focus on reading with music playing. Or any sort of stop/start noise.

After she got the headphones, there was no problem except at nights - she had asked for a weeknight bed time of 10:30 which I at first agreed to, but now I am thinking needs to be reconsidered. I have 3 classes a week - an early/all day lab-lecture class Monday and the other two are in evenings, however she has classes every day, and more than me since she's an undergrad. I don't think she has followed her own bed time for weeks, usually she goes to bed after midnight lately. 

I almost ALWAYS have to get my PJs and put my things away, etc etc. in the dark because she turns off the light and goes to bed when she wants at an arbitrary time, and I cannot ask her are you going to bed now? because that wakes her up to be asked after she was lying in bed reading getting tired, so I have no notice/warning when I can make sure my books are put away and put my clothes away. If I take my laptop out into the common area to use past when she sleeps, knowing I will be awake for a few hours longer, I have to return it to the room and do everything in the dark - I cannot prop the door open very far or have much light shine in because it might shine in her face and she thinks it's morning so she wakes up.

Recently, she has commented the noise canceling headphones do NOT, in fact, block out the noise like she previously claimed. And she has midterms 'coming up' which are over a 2 or 3 week period. So she wants to renegotiate things again and she wants me to go out of the room more. Well, my monitor cannot be moved. I also do not like doing my HW on a smaller screen as it messes up the visual white space I am used to, plus the laptop KB is meh, and it is annoying to take too many things out to the common area and try to drag them back into place in the dark. She also turns out the room light arbitrarily because it makes the room too hot and I have to use my desk light only, without asking if I mind the darkness.

I feel like I concede most things to her - when the light goes off randomly, when she goes to bed and I have to get ready in the dark, the arbitrary bed time she almost never follows. She also claims we agreed to an 11:30 bedtime on Fridays/Saturdays which I do NOT remember and would NOT have agreed to, that's an absurd time and I like to stay up late chatting with people, plus who goes to bed that early? She's an undergrad, not a med student.

She is frustrated I am often in the room, however, she cannot even see me from her bed or desk. But I feel like I am paying for the room, I have a right to use it and be in it. My laptop should be treated like a desktop imo. I was considering buying one on the assumption my old laptop would be fixed and sent down for mobile use - a good thing I didn't as it wound up unable to be repaired and now I only have mine. 

I went to work with writer friends and was gone for 11 hours on Friday, during which time she was studying at her house until 5 (I left ~2) and then decided to go out on a Tinder date to a bar. She then asked me to give her some alone time in the room to study quietly on Saturday after she sat in the common area studying (the other two were not here) for a few hours, but I felt she should have not gone out Friday if she wanted her precious alone time. I was also gone almost all yesterday working on scripts. 

It's to the point where I feel like I always have to be on edge, I can never just sit back and relax in my room if she is here. I want to just chat with people while I watch a show and do homework and type as much as I like while writing. I have changed when I play LoL/Dota2 and play them much less than I actually could. I try to avoid evenings because she studies best in them and they are a lot of clicks/typing. But I am changing my schedule/habits for her, what is she changing to make up for her problem with my keyboard/mouse?

At what point should I tell her I am not leaving the room before a certain point at night when she goes to bed? I want to do homework/spend free time on MY MONITOR/KEYBOARD, not the crappy laptop keyboard and smaller screen. Or am I in the wrong for not being more willing to move despite having a desktop setup and it being uncomfortable to try and write too long on the laptop keyboard?

Or is this her problem and she should just go to the freakin' library to study if she needs to? I feel like after her weeks-long midterms are done something else will crop up, or her real issue is privacy and how I am here a lot due to not having classes and enjoying down time in the room. But pussyfooting around that won't get her anywhere. She also had the audacity to suggest I should buy a new keyboard that is quieter, when I have NO problem with the one I have. I found that beyond rude to suggest HER problem be fixed by me spending money. I do not use Macs, btw. My friend who came to sound check said the mouse may be a bit loud and it might get annoying to hear for an hour straight, but that she ultimately had no right to ask me to leave the room since I pay for it, and she is disrupting my habits and comfort and routine, and it is obnoxious to do homework on the laptop keyboard.

I am going to speak to the RA on our floor once I see his door open. But having never lived on campus before I am uncertain where to draw a line - I feel like I am very quiet and respectful, except I am a writing student who likes to be on her computer a lot and THAT SOUND ANNOYS HER. Should she just move out (she also lives in the city but lives on campus) to another dorm room? Or just go to the library despite that not being as comfortable to her as lying in her bed, because it is SOLELY her problem? I hope I got everything relevant down, sorry about length and if this is jumbled.

29781,Non-Romantic,2qgudp,"Brief back story: My sister and I are completely different people. Very contrasting personalities, most prominently in the fact that she is shy, not as vocationally motivated, very stubborn/not open to trying new things, and much less in tune with young culture. On the other hand, I am extremely outgoing, very academically motivated, love trying new things/being uncomfortable, and like fashion/makeup/music, etc. MY point in bringing this up is that when we are together, we have very little to talk about besides our mutual upbringing. 

There is some resentment in our relationship. I am very successful academically and am on the path to get a high-paying job when I graduate (part of this is due to genetics, part is due to an immense amount of hard work and high expectations I have for myself. I know I can do well, and push myself to do so). I am very involved and social. She doesn't have many friends (very introverted) and wasn't too involved no campus. She isn't stupid, but she attended a mid-tier state school and is having trouble getting the certification she needs for the job she wants to get (one considered mid-tier by most, but I respect anyone pursuing their passion)- a lot of this is because she simply doesn't try, isn't studying for the exams she needs to pass, refuses networking opportunities my parents gave her, etc. She has not shown any instances of being unsupportive or jealous that I can recall. My somewhat oblivious father will sometimes harp on my accomplishments in front of friends, and during a fight not too long ago she expressed that these instances wore on her and I gave the impression that I feel like I'm better than her. I don't- I don't respect anyone who doesn't work hard towards their goals, but part of my fundamental belief system is that everyone has value and can teach me something- and I told her that. I also have some resentment towards her because she was sometimes very shitty to me as a child and is very destructive and hurtful during fights (long time to hold on, I know, but I can't help how I feel). I'm not a super emotional person and otherwise feel quite neutral towards her. 

Current Situation: My sister loves animals and always have. I really like animals too, and we had several dogs growing up that I loved and cared for, although not as much as her. She has moved about an hour away from my house and (vagueness to try not to give away too much) is attending an extra program to attempt to try and get the certification she needs in another way (after not passing the exams required multiple times). My parents pay for her rent and school and only recently forced her to get a part-time job at a restaurant (she had refused up until this point). She has a long-term boyfriend who visits frequently as well (he works for my parents, can't find a job). My sister adopted this dog from an abuse shelter a couple months before she moved out of my parents house (a year or so ago). The dog has been previously abused and was very suspicious about humans, although it is small so there is no real physical concern.

So eventually the dog get close to my sister, but otherwise is very nervous around everyone else. It bites anyone who tries to pet it, and has bitten my mom several times when she tries to take him out. I pretty much ignore it, but through time it develops an extreme hatred towards me and it gets to the point where it starts chasing me down the hallways of my house trying to bite me whenever I walk near it. I am very hurt (it doesn't feel good to have anyone hate you, even a dog) and express to my sister that she needs to control it/train it better. She gets very defensive and we fight a lot until it moves out.

So basically we continue very passively fighting about the dog until this Thanksgiving. I already asked my parents from my university if her dog was coming, they say the dog is not. When I get home, two days before the holiday, my sister texts me telling me that she will be sure to watch the dog and gives me strategies for making sure the dog doesn't bite me when it's around but that'll be kept locked in a room most of the time anyway. I don't respond to this- I've had this fight with her so many times where each time I tell her that her instance of me getting in contact with the dog is ruining my sister and I's relationship. I tell my mom- it's their house we're meeting at- and she tells me the dog won't come and contacts my sister. Who promptly throws a bitch fit and is now refusing to come to our Thanksgiving (albeit it small- my family, my aunt (mildly allergic to dogs but likes them), my uncle, my very elderly grandmother), which I think is immature but whatever. So eventually my mom tells me the dog is coming and will be kept in the room and that she compromised. I am extremely hurt and we begin fighting. I call her out for failing to deliver on her promise (that's why I asked before hand) and that it doesn't feel like a compromise because she's pretty much doing what she said she was going to do. My sister claims the dog can't be left alone for the dinner (admittedly she does have to attend her boyfriend's near us as well- however the whole ordeal could have her back within 5 hours). Apparently my sister has this sick fantasy that the dog and I become friends through her guidance but I'm not a willing player- it still bites people, even her boyfriend who is around a lot, and I don't want to be part of the experiment. I know it's not fair to put my mom in the middle of this but I've tried so many times to reason with my sister and she is so stubborn and unreasonable that I just went above both of our heads- our so I thought. My parents know that I would never not show up to a family gathering with people who don't get to see me so I basically got screwed. It's a pretty big fight between my mom and I am, and I kind of go in on her for rewarding my sister's stubborn behavior and teaching her that this is a way to get what she wants. I tell her directly that I feel disrespected and it's not fair to give in to whoever's willing to throw the biggest shit storm. After the holiday my mom pretty much concedes- Maybe you're right.- and my sister sends an apology text which I accept. 

And so, Christmas comes. My sister stays over and I pretty much concede to the dog going to be here over holidays, but I reinforce with my mother that I want it kept in the room, away from me. I hear it running around when I'm in bed, whatever, they put it away when I get up. However, later in that day I see it running around when I'm sitting down and I get angry, and yell at my mom to put it away. My mom tells my sister, who defiantly goes Why? and then I pretty much lose my shit. The dogs get put away and then I go to my room to cool off, open the door to grab something and see them running around again. I get that I was in my room, but I want to have the freedom to walk around in the house that I'm living in, and I honestly feel anxious and fearful being around the dog (it's chased me growling multiple times, mind you). I bring in my mother and yell at her, trying to control my anger but I can't. I tell her I feel disrespected and that they're choosing the dog over me. I tell her that she's breaking her end of the deal again. I tell her I feel uncomfortable in our house and she apologizes but kind of makes me feel like I'm being overdramatic about it. We continue on and I let it go and adopt a positive attitude for the extended relatives and pretty much enjoy my Christmas. My sister gives me a subtle silent treatment the rest of the day, but I'm not bothered.

Now I get it- it seems like a stupid argument, and that I should just man up and deal with my irrational fear of the dog. However, like most petty fights, it's the principle. My sister has complained that I don't reach out to her enough and that she'd like to see me more- but she was willing to not come to Thanksgiving (first time I'd see her in 6 months), just because she was afraid of leaving the dog alone? It feels like she's continually picking the animal over me- choosing not leaving the dog lonely for 6 hours even though she knows how much it upsets me when she lets it run loose. At this point, our complete lack of things in common and what I view as an irreconcilable personality flaw (lack of empathy) leave me wanting to just let our relationship fade- not avoid/be rude to her for the sake of our parents, but pretty much never talk to her of my own volition.

Sorry that was so long, it's been building for a while. What I want to know- this is petty, but am I being petty? What can I do to overcome my overdrmatic urges if so? How is my fading her out plan?

29797,Non-Romantic,1x980n,"Frank has been my best friend since high school. He's like my brother - we've never had any romantic feelings for each other (I'm gay), no dating history, etc. We stayed close throughout high school and into college, even though we went to school 10+ hours away from each other. We would text &amp; FaceTime weekly and hang out during breaks, even after I moved back to our hometown.


He has been in a serious relationship for about a year and a half with Sarah [22 F] who I love and get along with well. Since they got together he spent less time talking to me, which I'm 100% cool with since she should be the most important person in his life as his SO. We still hung out on breaks and texted and stuff, just less frequently.


He graduates from college in the fall, a year early. I have a few years left due to some health issues I had to take time off for. Now I wasn't expecting us to be best friends forever. I know that that is rarely the case, especially in mixed-gender friendships. When I've talked about the future, he's been a bit cagey - basically, I could tell that our friendship definitely had an expiration date. I figured we'd graduate college, go on to grad school, and chat from time to time. Low-key, still friendly, but not BFF status.


He texted me last night and said that we should FaceTime. We set up a time for tomorrow night, and I asked if he had anything specific he needed to talk about (usually if he needs some support about our shared mental illness, I can help him as his SO is blissfully free of the scourge of bipolar disorder). He said kind of, yeah and it's kind of serious.


Normally this wouldn't alarm me at all. He's had some tough shit happen in his life over the past few years, and we've had some difficult conversations with him working through his emotions (I eventually convinced him to go see a therapist). But this semester he's hardly spoken to me at all. He visited a few weeks ago with his girlfriend and they caught me at a rough time, so I wasn't in a great mood.


I can be pretty needy. I'm working on it (therapy, etc.) &amp; I don't contact him unless it's particularly important or informational. I just think he's finally gotten sick of me. I've always known that I care about him more than he cares about me, I just thought he was going to stick around until at least his college graduation.


I have other friends, but not having him in my life is going to be noticeable. I don't ever expose him to these insecurities, so I can't outright be like so when are we not going to be friends anymore?


I guess I just need help navigating this. I've never lost a close friend like this before. My female BFF from high school drifted naturally &amp; we had closure. In this case I'm pretty sure I'll just say something like it was nice knowing you, hang up, and go get really, really drunk.

I need some advice, guys, but I'll try to keep this brief and to the point.  Me

I'm a guy who had a female friend for about 3 years I met in college.

I had a serious crush on her the night we met.  Almost one of those love at first sight things. 

I was sure she had feelings for me, really REALLY sure, but I never said anything cause I was working my way out of a relationship at the time and wanted to be honorable.

We part ways after college, but shoot each other emails sporadically.

After about a year, I'm like let's get together.  We have dinner for 3 hours.  

It was amazing.  I know I'm in love with this woman.  We're gonna have dinner again.  I'm planning on telling her how I feel. 

We're sharing texts, flirting back and forth.

We have scheduling conflicts.  Suddenly her attitude changes.

Text her, she says she's confused.  I ask any chance we can be more than friends?  She's flattered, but not dating right now.  Complete 180.

I lose it.  I act like a total dipshit and and email her telling her my feelings (remember we knew each other for 3 years, so hoping it's not too creeperish ).  Basically worst crush confession ever.  Disaster, I admit.  Not a great moment.

I get an email back telling me she's seeing someone else and she didn't want to hurt my feelings.  She needs space.  My impression is she decided to be with the other guy and I'm absolutely crushed, *crushed*,  and pissed.

Honestly, if she just told me she wanted to see someone else, I could respect that. We all gotta do what makes us happy.

Remember, we were friends for awhile, before we had dinner - 3 years.  I have some time to think and realize I really want my friend back.

I shoot her the occasional email saying hey, I made a mistake, would really like to be friends still.  Miss seeing you.  

Heard nothing for almost two years. 

On a lark last week I sent her like a 2 sentence email saying let's get together as friends.

Never expect to hear from her again, we all know what needing space means.

I'm shocked when she writes back.

Explains she was stunned, didn't know what to say, considers me a good friend, but needs some more time before we hang out.

My feelings for her haven't changed.  At all in the past 5 years.  That said, I honestly would be fine being friends cause that's what we were.  Seems to me two people should be able to be friends after a situation like this.  It's unbelievable how much we have in common.

29811,Non-Romantic,23tcy2,"So this is a complicated situation. I'll try my hardest to be concise.

**First, some back-story**

About 6 years ago, I was roommates with a girl for a year (let's call her Stacey). There's no other way to describe this chick other than batshit nuts.

She undoubtedly had a difficult upbringing, leading to the nuttiness - she was born in another country &amp; given up for adoption. Her Canadian adoptive parents are very very religious - father is a religious church leader. When Stacey was a young teenager, she became pregnant and was forced to give her child up for adoption, so as not to embarrass her family &amp; the community.

Now since that time, her adoptive parents have spoiled her absolutely rotten. When we were living together, her parents paid for *everything* for her. Her share of rent. Food. Anything and everything she wanted. She went on shopping sprees every other weekend, racking-up hundreds of dollars in purchases. 

She refused to get a job because everything was too hard. She frequently talked about finding a baby-daddy, ANY baby-daddy, so [she] can get pregnant &amp; live off the government for the rest of [her] life. She'd shower maybe once a week. She would regularly clog the toilet &amp; call me at work, forcing me to rush home to find 3 inches of dirty toilet water spewing out of the washroom all over the apartment (no matter how many times I showed her how to stop it from overflowing, she'd still call me and wait for me to come home and fix it AND clean it up while she rushed out on some important errand).

More recently (6-8 months ago), she busted her leg somehow ... instead of staying off her leg, she continued to go out to her regular bars (an almost-daily occurrence), wearing stilettos with her crutches. Then posted to Facebook about how difficult it was for her to get around, and how she couldn't get to her classes. And *of course*, that it prevented her from working at any job.

I have story after story about this girl, but I think the above gives a general idea. And trust me, I wouldn't have lived with her for an entire year if we hadn't both signed a 1-year lease. I got out of there as soon as I possibly could. I tried so many things to try and help her get her life on track. Mutual friends tried many things. If I didn't know that she was a reasonably intelligent person, I would assume she's slow based on how she reacted to our attempts to help - blank stares, walking away, becoming belligerent and uncommunicative, etc. She's seen therapists, and all she ever talked about was how they were a bunch of morons who just wanted her to go get a job *sigh*.

Her and I haven't really spoken in YEARS - I've moved to another city, and really just had no interest in trying to remain friends with someone who I had tried so hard to help, but who was completely unwilling to help herself. So I see some of the weird stuff she posts to FB from time to time, but that's about it.

**So, the issue now ...** 

She created an invite-only event on Facebook and invited well over 100 people (myself included). The event description basically goes like this: Please keep this private, only post here or PM me. My father has been diagnosed with cancer. I'm the only child that lives here with him. I need your financial support so that I can take time off work to take care of him. I'll be doing a fundraiser. Please come out and support us.

I have some MAJOR concerns with this. First off, I can pretty much guarantee that any $ she raises will just go directly to her pocket so that she can continue to be a lazy shit. From what I understand from quite a few mutual friends, she isn't actually working anyway. However, I also know that at some point in the past couple of years, her parents cut-off financial support (or at least partially cut it off) - but they are wealthy people, fully able to pay for whatever needs paying-for. We also live in Canada, so it's not like they're racking-up medical expenses while he goes through treatment.

My feeling on it all: people deserve to know that their donations wouldn't be going towards any sort of good cause. I've linked some resources to her, such as government-funded home care, etc. ... my thinking being that, if I could take away her reasons for doing this fundraiser, she might reconsider. Nope. She just doesn't reply to my posts &amp; spams the event full of other crap.

A couple of friends of mine are talking about going to this event &amp; publicly calling her out on her shitty behaviour. But I feel like at that point, you're just becoming a douche yourself by doing that. People who don't know her, won't understand ... and then you're just that guy who tried to ruin a fundraiser for Stacey's poor father.

I've gone as far as even trying to look up tax laws to see if I can semi-politely force her to put the brakes on this plan - but I'm coming up at a dead end. I'm obviously not going to contribute money myself - but even the thought of other people donating to this makes me want to vomit.

And in all honesty, it wouldn't even shock me if she's lying about her father having cancer. And if that is actually the case ... wow, I don't even have words.

Seriously guys, what can I do?

29819,Non-Romantic,3ag983,"I had a tight-knit group of friends at high school who I'm still really good friends with.  One of the girls, Sophie [31F], has a sister, Charlotte [29F], who is a couple of years younger than all of us.  As the years went on, everyone in that group except me ended up getting married and popping out babies.  




Obviously, our friendships ended up changing as they couldn't socialize as easily as they used to.  During this time (the last 3/4 years or so) Charlotte and I became very close.  We share a hobby, so I ended up seeing her at least once a week in connection with that, but usually more frequently, as we'd often go out partying together.  Charlotte is a very outgoing and sociable person, so I enjoyed her company and we had a tons of fun times.  In addition to this, we were a shoulder for each other to cry on when we both experienced some messy and painful break ups.  It was good to have a friend around at the time who could help me through that, especially when so many of my other friends had met their partners fairly young and couldn't understand what it was like.




OK, so that all sounds all very well and good.  And it was.  Up until a point.  But the problem with Charlotte is that she's incredibly insecure and her main way of dealing with her own issues is to belittle others in order to feel better about herself.  A few examples of this include:
- Telling one friend it was surprising that men found her attractive as she had an unusual face and a bit of a belly (bearing in mind this particular friend is incredibly pretty and a size 8, Charlotte is a size 16).
- Constantly emphasizing she's younger than me whenever we meet anyone new (which backfires as I look a lot younger than I am and people generally assume I'm the younger one).
- Telling another friend there was no point her joining our hobby group as not everyone can have natural talent at it (I don't want to say what they hobby is, as it's too unusual and identifiable, but Charlotte is incredibly talented and likes to show off about it at every opportunity).
- And so on and so on.




I used to let stuff like this slide for a long time, because I did value her friendship and always felt her good points outweighed the bad.  But that all changed when I finally met Paul a couple of years ago. 



 
I'd been single for a while and Charlotte had just ended a 3 month relationship when we met Paul on one of our party nights out.  From the very beginning, things just felt right with Paul.  We connected in a way I'd never felt before and in 18 months, we'd got engaged and tied the knot.




Charlotte has really struggled to deal with this.  When we first started dating, Charlotte kept asking if I was sure I wasn't on the rebound (my previous long term relationship had been 5 months before) and I could see her eyes glaze over whenever I mentioned how well things were going with Paul.  Knowing she was going through a rough patch, I stopped talking about it, as I didn't want her to feel like I was rubbing it in.   




But then things got very one-sided.  I was expected to give advice and sympathy whenever she had a crisis, which I was happy to do, but she didn't want to know that things were finally working out for me.  One time, after I spent four hours helping her with a problem she was dealing with, she actually said to me,  But that's enough about me.  Tell me how things are with Paul.  But briefly. (!)




When Paul and I got engaged, Charlotte warned me it was too soon and that I was making a mistake.  We argued about that, but made up again.  I think she assumed she'd end up being in the wedding party (she wasn't) and she questioned why I had my friend Lucy as one of my bridesmaids as she didn't think we were close (I've known Lucy since elementary school and she's been an amazingly supportive friend for as long as I've known her).  Charlotte was weird at the wedding and went to bed really early (about 7pm) because she was so exhausted.  Before she disappeared, she had time to remark half-jokingly, Oooh, look at you.  So you finally found someone who'd take you, eh?  To which one of my guy friends replied, Oooh, look at you.  Jealous and bitter, much?




Paul can't stand her.  He thinks she's attention-seeking and selfish and pointed out that whenever I see her now, I come back complaining about how awful she is.  Case in point: I met up with Charlotte for coffee yesterday and she was as self-centered as ever.  She even managed to embarrass me in front of a co-worker who happened to be there and she vaguely knew, by telling her something very private I'd told Charlotte in confidence.




I don't regard her as a friend any more and would quite happily cut her toxic self out of my life, but the problem is, she's managed to latch herself on to that highschool friendship group via Sophie and now gets invited to all our get togethers.  Plus, as Sophie's sister, it's difficult to know how to get rid of her.  Sophie is a lovely, lovely person and Charlotte's polar opposite, but they're very close.  I'm more worried about hurting Sophie's feelings than Charlotte's.

I have a **brother**(25M) but he's mostly out of the picture, he joined the navy and is becoming a nuclear engineer and has been very successful, top of his class and a good student/worker and so on. By contrast I look pretty damn bad. We're both on good terms. He used to be a target of my dad's ire before he went through kind of a self improvement stage and made the decision to get out and join the navy. Now my dad's cool with him, of course. 

**Grandmother(Dad's side)**: Lives nearby, needing more and more support from us. Stressing out my dad further as she has worsening dementia. They're both prone to overreaction and drama so it's not a great combination.

We also have a small **dog** (~1yo mutt) who's me and my mom's main source of therapy at the moment. My dad unfortunately not as fond of him as he was our old dog.

 I'm wondering if the situation has become bad enough to warrant a family therapist or something like that. I believe I can get my mom on board with this, dad might be difficult as I believe he doesn't like the idea of/doesn't really trust in the effectiveness of therapy. My mom may be capable of convincing him though. I am tired of living in the same house with my dad, but I know I'm not going to move out and become a productive citizen in the near future. 

I want something to change, but can't really talk to my dad. If all three of us enter any sort of discussion, my dad gets increasingly angry and my mom just gets mad at him for being mean to me and wants us all to stop talking about it.

We live in a tiny house with thin walls and I've started feeling really uncomfortable and claustrophobic. I'm very introverted and though she seems like a sweet girl I've gotten really tired of running into her multiple times a day. 

I also find it annoying that they both never leave the house. They're here when I leave in the morning and when I get back they don't seem to have moved. I'm a private person and have found that I don't feel comfortable chatting to friends in the living room while they can hear from the kitchen or even having a private phone call - my bedroom is right next to his and we can both hear everything that's being said in the other room. One night I went to the bathroom off the kitchen to avoid being overheard and immediately heard him outside the door of the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen. 

I really don't care about asking the girlfriend to pay rent or bills. Though it's annoying that she's using everything, it's really not about that for me. It's having too many extra people in the house for me to feel comfortable. Our other roommate's boyfriend is here probably 5 nights a week too, I would say something about this but she's moving out soon so I'm not bothering.

29839,Non-Romantic,2hsr29,"So, the preface this, this isn't a HUGE issue for me I'm just not totally sure the right thing to do in this situation and want some insight before I proceed. 

I recently ended things with my bf/fwb and have been spending a lot of time with friends, meeting new people, etc.

About 2 months ago, I became friends with T. We met through my fwb as she had known him a while and was just going through a bad divorce/split and needed some new people to hang out with. We hung out as a group several times and me and T totally hit it off! We are a lot alike and I absolutely adore her! We text and snapchat about our relationship issues and always make plans to hang out but we are both so busy, and she has a son. The past three weeks or so I haven't seen her and we haven't talked nearly as much but I'd still like to be her friend, as I don't have many girlfriends that I click with and like. But I would not say we are anywhere close to super close.

Fast forward to the past week, I've been hanging out with a bunch of people from T's town and her ex, R, started hanging out with us. I had met him before briefly but we hung out a lot last night with a bunch of people and really hit it off. I have no romantic feelings for him, he's not really my type, but he is really funny and sweet and I enjoy his company and definitely want us all to hang out more and we are planning a trip to a concert next week.

The issue is, I feel like I have to pick one to be friends with. They are both going through a nasty divorce and custody battle and don't want pictures of each other posted online, and talk trash on each other. In the past, T has asked me to take photos of him at events I'm at that she knows he is at when he is supposed to have their son. Both of them hate each other and don't have any mutual friends with their exes.

I KNOW if T found out I was friends with R, she would flip out and wouldn't associate with me anymore. I almost feel loyal to her because she was my friend first.  But, then again we haven't hung out all that much, aren't super close and R is friends with a ton of my mutual friends I am now hanging out with and being his friend seems unavoidable if I want to keep hanging out with my friends, which I need to do. But, I also adore T and would love to continue being her friend. She's definitely one of my few girlfriends and I don't want to damage her trust or hurt her feelings. She has said before when we went to an event that R would he at, please don't be their (him and a girl he brought) friend and forget about me!

Is there anything I can do to alleviate the drama and tension here,  or am I overreacting and worrying over something that may not be a big deal?


Just not sure how to proceed withough causing problems!!

I'm 23, a graduate and I managed to start a new job. I knew my parents relationship was rocky but all I really focused on was trying to plan my own life and finally move out after living at home my entire life. 

This past month everything got so much worse and my dad just announced to the family he's getting a divorce and leaving in 6 months. I feel angry, bitter, rejected but also relieved. He's been emotionally abusing the entire family for years now and I think its all for the best but I just can't stomach the damage he's leaving behind. 

He's a very traditional person born and raised in africa and as a muslim he's got a big distaste for the west. This means that he would bully us and make us feel small whenever he saw us embrace anything western. This still wouldn't be fine and dandy if we lived anywhere else but we live in the UK and this was a daily challenge for us. We had to assume different identities whenever he was home to avoid trouble and as a result, nobody was happy at home. Especially my mum. She can't even listen to music in peace without him belittling her. This was a necessity because if we would just be ourselves he would scare us by destroying our possessions. I've had a TV thrown out of a second floor window because I was playing games in the morning before school. I was 11. I wish I could say this was the only instance but it wasn't, not by a long shot. 

I stopped having any sort of emotional attachment to him many years ago because he put too many conditions on his love. He genuinely told me several that our relationship was purely based on how devout I was to religion and how often I prayed. As I grew up, the price wasn't worth the relationship for me and I just stopped interacting with my dad. It has gotten to the point that before this we would go weeks without even acknowledging each other or speaking a word. 

Despite the fact that almost all of us in the family cut ties with him emotionally, its still scary for me to see what effect this will have on my younger siblings (10 and 7) and the horrible financial situation that he's left us in (a string of failed businesses with my uncles) leaves me resentful because I have to put my life on hold to support my mum and siblings till they get on their feet. 

I just can't comprehend that the same man who put such an emphasis on family values when I was growing up is now turning his back on 6 children and not even making clear the extent of his support after he leaves. It feels like he's preparing to cut ties without paying anything but I'm sure my mum won't let him get away with that.

I hate how his narrow mindset is so intent on sabotaging anything that doesn't fit with his worldview. He tried to guilt my sister into leaving uni because he doesn't think women need to be educated. He's leaving my mum while she's in her 3rd year of a part time law degree after she finally worked up the courage to go back to school. This means she won't be able to complete her education  and provide for her family at the same time while my dad gets to complete his business degree in peace (he went back to uni as well).

I feel so tired from this situation. The future looks so scary and my depression is kicking in hard. Trying to stay strong for my mother as her emotional support through all of this is affecting me physically as well. I haven't been able to sleep properly for weeks (I'm typing this up at 4am when I work a 9-5), I got constant headaches, my skin looks terrible... I just don't know how I can keep going and I don't even have anyone that I feel comfortable opening up to this about.

When I first transferred to a new college years ago, I had no idea I was about to meet the best friend I'd ever had and the one person who would change my life forever. We met through mutual friends and occasionally ran into each other on our way to class and found out we have a lot in common. Then we started to run into each other all the time and no matter what he was doing or where he was going he would drop it, run over to greet me and follow me around. I'm a naturally shy person and used to being ignored, so at first I didn't know how to handle the sudden interest but pretty soon we were inseparable.

We talked for hours. Completed each other's sentences. Supported each other through the bad times. I never thought two people could be this close outside of a romantic relationship or family. I asked him to officiate at my future wedding and he asked me to be the godmother of his future children.

At times I wondered (out loud, drunkenly) if we were really best friends or if he just said that to everyone. In many ways it didn't make sense; he is the life of the party and everyone in town knows and loves him. He is able to empathize and connect with others on a level most will never achieve, while I'm terrified to talk to strangers and fade into the background. But he assured me that he meant it.

I should mention that this whole time he was/still is in a committed relationship with the love of his life-a super cool girl who is perfect for him. He fully intends to marry her. I realize as I'm gushing on and on about this guy that I sound head over heels in love, and while there may have been moments where the thought crossed my mind, I'm not the kind of person to break up a relationship. Not only would it ruin our friendship, devastate this wonderful girl and destroy both our reputations, I just don't see us as a romantic couple.

In a way I do love him, but like a life-long friend/brother. We've talked about those brief moments that almost crossed the line, and realize it was wrong and just our heterosexual brains trying to trick us, but we can control ourselves. 

However about a year after we met he started to withdraw. He flunked out of school, which was really unexpected for someone so brilliant. He simply stopped going to class. He got blackout drunk and smoked excessively. I was pretty worried. I tried to ask what was wrong, and what I could do to help and eventually he admitted that he felt guilty about having feelings for another girl (not me but a girl he worked with over the summer), and it sent him into a depression. He felt like he betrayed his gf emotionally, and was upset that he had those feelings and couldn't stop them from popping up. I tried to tell him that actions are what really matter, but I'm not sure it helped. I feel like there isn't much I can do to help with this...I don't want to interfere too much and upset him/his gf.

Since then I've tried to reach out, but I rarely see or hear of him anymore. Something tends to come up when we made plans to hang out. He still hasn't met my bf of 7 months. I went to his birthday party last November, he helped me through a horrible break up, and I saw him one more time right before graduation. I've hardly heard from him since.

Now I'm afraid to even initiate text conversations. I don't want to be the crazy girl that begs to him to hang out and won't leave him alone. But I also know that if I don't make the effort, I'll never see him again. I can't tell if it's the depression or if he really doesn't care that much anymore. After all he has so many friends and I know I'm not that special. I'm worried this friendship has become like a drug addiction for me...it felt so good in the beginning but now I realize I've been chasing that high, and now I'm going through withdrawal and the only cure is to go cold turkey.

His ex-girlfriend's mother is also a junkie.  It's not just hings he's said though.

29883,Non-Romantic,2jfmrk,"My best friend Sam and his ex Kiara broke up in 2013 while I was out of the state with significant problems of my own, but when it came to helping him out with that breakup I did the best job I could. I texted and called, but often Sam didn't want to call anyway because of how shitty he was feeling. Which is perfectly okay. I really wished I could be there for him but it was a whole semester before I could fly home again to keep him company.

However, I also reached out to his ex. Sam, his ex Kiara and another mutual friend of ours John (and myself) were basically seeing each other on a bi-weekly basis and we had become really close - so I thought it was the right thing to do to see if she was doing fine in addition to my best friend. When I got back in Perth, I essentially resumed both friendships, making sure that I saw both frequently but obviously separate. It was difficult but I felt like it was workable plus it's in my nature to try and make sure everyone was okay post-breakup. Our mutual friend would join Kiara and I while I would typically see Sam seperately.

However, what I came to realise is that Sam took the continued friendship with Kiara as a personal affront and, while he said it wasn't jealousy, he said he hated her controlling the situation and should have just walked out of his life completely, and that he was manipulating both of us even when we didn't know it. I would keep messaging him telling him that he was my best friend and I would always keep supporting him, but I just couldn't just shut off a friendship which essentially made Kiara and I best friends too. He was always varyingly dismissive but we always managed to calm things down and patch things up if he was feeling stressed or anxious about her. I did as much as I can when this would happen to the point were I felt I was being over the top. I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve a little bit, especially where friends are concerned.

Fast forward to this month and Sam's being cancelling things I've tried to organise with him (always me trying to organise, never the other way round. But that's another thing entirely). After talking to him about it, he says it's because he's still cut up about us being friends with Kiara and he feels he's competing for us, and that there's nothing we can do because we did this to him when we remained friends with Kiara when they broke up and that what we did will either live with him or something's going to have to happen. 

He cancelled on me today and again, we had a talk mainly so I could understand what was going on. I really needed it to be over because it was just wearing me down, and for an hour or 2 I tried to listen and offer my support to help him along, and try and express how much I care but it fell on tin ears mainly as he told me that it's never going to get better, he's starting to hate us for remaining friends and from now on he's going to do whatever makes him happy while getting snappy because I still have no fucking clue what the true problem is. I asked if that meant us severing ties or something and he simply said it was up to us. 

I couldn't handle any more and I just left. Sam is one of the most important people in the world to me and it's killing me that he hates me for a friendship I have, especially after all the good things we've shared and the effort I try and put in to our relationship.

Anyways, S and I were pretty close. We hung out after school every week and played silly make believe games where we pretended we were characters from Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. We remained close until fifth grade, when that other best friend stabbed me in the back, and I sort of turned my back on the world and stopped trusting other kids.

29917,Non-Romantic,21ji3t,"I currently live at home with my parents and my physically disabled grandmother, whom I care for when I'm not working (I work weekend) or going to class (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

I'd like to think of myself as a good daughter and granddaughter. I try my best to be courteous, to do everything they ask of me, to be open and honest with them about where I'm going and who I'm with, and I abide by their home by 6pm curfew. I don't sneak around. The only time I have recently snuck around was to go to Planned Parenthood for an IUD, because if my dad found out that I was even *considering* having sex he would have flipped shit. Even then, I still told my mother (who is much more understanding of things like that) and I didn't end up getting it anyway.

My spring break is coming up, so I talked to my boyfriend about spending two nights of my spring break in a nearby city (I don't want to stay in this city because there's nothing exciting to do if you're under 21). He said he'd love to, and we decided to share a hotel room. We have already had a discussion about how we're probably not going to have sexual intercourse while we're on vacation, due to my current issues with vaginal penetration. In other words: he's not expecting sex to come out of this.

My parents [52M &amp; 49F] are slowly warming up to the idea, but my mother is understandably still having a hard time with the idea of us sharing a hotel room, and my dad doesn't even know that we planned to. I understand their concerns, but I'm paying for this trip on my own and they have raised me to make responsible decisions and choices. I really want to go, because I haven't been able to have a vacation in a considerable amount of time, and it would be nice to be able to do something for myself and spend some quality time with my boyfriend.

My grandmother [79F] isn't exactly supportive either. She essentially called me a slut (in that concerned, Southern way) and told me that I should always surround myself with family for protection's sake. She doesn't understand why I would want independence, or to be away from my parents.

This whole thing is giving me a headache. I didn't want any of this. I just wanted to  take a few days to explore a new, exciting place with someone I care about. I just wanted to escape the family drama (my mother is a functioning alcoholic, my dad is overworked and constantly stressed out, my grandmother is very demanding, etc.) for a few days. Is that too much to ask for? Should I just lie down and take it, or should I fight for my right to a vacation? Is there some in-between option that I'm missing?

**tl;dr:** I want to go on a two-day trip to a nearby city with my boyfriend. I don't want to stay in this city, because there's nothing exciting to do if you're under 21. We're paying for our trip, so my parents are literally not doing or paying for anything. I'm afraid that my family will try to stop me from going on this vacation, and that they will judge me and think that I'm impure or slutty if I do indeed go. I'm feeling burned out and I need a break from the family chaos.

29924,Non-Romantic,2qwdrk,"I've known my best friend for nearly two years. We used to hang out and talk all the time; every weekend and a few days during the week we would do stuff and we talked almost every day. Life happened and we both got busy so we stopped hanging out and talking as much. I didn't like it necessarily but I did understand and it was never an issue. 
 
The past few months though, probably since September, we' hung out maybe once or twice a month for a few hours. The issue is that now I can barely get her to commit to anything in advance, and the majority of the time when we make plans, she'll cancel. At first she wouldn't even tell me so I would sit around and wait for hours before asking if they were still on. I told her that bothered me so at least now she sometimes tells me in advance when she wants to cancel. But she still cancels on like 75% at least of all our plans even though she keeps the plans she makes with others. I'll admit I don't know if/how frequently she cancels on anyone else, I just know that she'll keep her plans with them and then cancel on me the next day because she's too busy with something else. 


The tipping point was this month. We hung out for an absolute maximum of 4hrs (coffee, dinner, a quick gift exchange). I had told her in the middle of the month that I really needed to see her to talk; I was going through a rough patch but every time we made plans, she was too busy to follow through. She kept all of her other plans with friends though (drinks, parties, video games). She finally had free time and was supposed to come over for a few hours before I left in the evening to fly home for a few days but apparently she got so drunk at a party the night before that she was too hungover so I just saw her long enough to give her Christmas gifts. 

What I need you to tell me is whether I'm being overly sensitive? Is canceling so much acceptable? When do I say enough is enough? I was raised to always follow through on plans so this is foreign to me. I understand things happen but it seems rude to constantly cancel... She says I'm her best friend, the one she talks to about important stuff... And that she's sorry when she cancels... It just doesn't feel like it... So I don't know what to do. 

Tl/dr: best friend has started canceling on me for the majority of any plans we make. She says I'm still her best friend and that she's sorry when she cancels. Am I being too sensitive or is this an issue? And if it is, what should I do? Thanks

Being the middle child I was always pretty independent and quiet, just going with the flow of things. Well whenever I see my siblings, they just want to drink or smoke. Which is normal perhaps. I am a fellow toker myself, but I keep that to myself and not apart of family. My parents hate it and I respect to not do it around them. 

Anyway, I love them so much, but my sister only wants to smoke or drink anytime we hang out. My brother is just so lost and has been manipulated into thinking drinking and rebelism is what's cool. Its hard to see because me and him hung out gaming or whatever everyday after school back in the day. We still do play some destiny here and there.

29947,Non-Romantic,30yxik,"2 high school mentors (Trevor and Alex) hired me right out of HS. Started at minimum wage, bumped up to 1/3 pay for my actual position roughly 2 mo. into the job. Work as programmer / engineer.


Relationship started out awesome: dinners out, late nights working together to manifest our ideas. Told I would receive profit sharing, health benefits, etc. (Promised by Trevor)


Since then, no raise has been awarded, I have not failed any duties but instead have performed superbly at my tasks. At one point was offered to have my education paid for and given full time employment because of my work ethic and skillset.


In time, relationship has degraded to being given bitch work (term used by Trevor), no raise in pay, called fucker, piece of shit, and most recently (after requesting a form) told to go fuck yourself you little piece of shit ... how is that for a response? Note that this is all at the hands of Trevor, Alex has never called me these things.


I am not a confrontational or offensive person. I am passive and am more apt to let things go and seek the solution rather than the direction of blame.


I have received full scholarship for my BS, MS, and PhD outside of work which is the reason for my declining the offer. I have received multiple job offers outside of work but have held loyal to my company as we contribute to education and lowering the barrier to entry for STEM fields (a passion I dearly love).


Other relevant info: After being offered the paid-for education (which I didn't need), I responded by saying I would need to be paid roughly 1/2 my earning potential as working full time would extend my education by a year. Given 1/2 my earning power would make up for the extended year they were requesting. Alex was the one who wanted me full time, Trevor never came back to conclude the offer.


Trevor doesn't take my calls, is short when he must speak with me, and doesn't appreciate questions. Alex is very open to me learning and always gives me tasks to help me grow and the company grow.


Trevor does not admit wrongdoing and rarely (if ever) apologizes. Trevor talks me up to clients to improve the image of the company but demeans me behind my back and often seems unsupportive of me.


Trevor has gone from 2 months ago asking if he could cover all my education and housing / benefits to work for him (even calling me the hardest working employee who does awesome work) to being very rude and not even acknowledging me.


Suggestion from friends and family has been to leave, that this treatment is inappropriate for the workplace, and that I'm being used. I am unsure.  I also very much like that my position helps education but am not appreciative of my pay or the way I'm talked to.


I understand not pressing my pay is my own fault, but I'm not sure if the way I'm spoken to is normal.
Question is: Is it time to quit? Or is this common workplace behavior?


I feel guilty quitting on Alex who has done no wrong (in my eyes) but staying means dealing with Trevor.

29956,Non-Romantic,1n0on0,"This is quite a long story but I will try my hardest to keep it to the point and on track.  I'll start at the beginning. 
My dad has always been a heavy partier and enjoyed his fair share of alcohol, drugs and rock and roll. For as long as I can remember, he has had a really hard time holding down a job, mainly because he just didn't want to. He allowed my mom to financially support him and his awful habits for almost 13 years. Finally, she became fed up and left him. 
For quite some time he lost control and went even farther off the deep end partying and being down right irresponsible.  During this time, I didn't see him except for maybe an hour here and there. Eventually he slowed down, turned his life around (sort of) while trying to get my mom back and got a job working for the department of transportation. It was a great job and he was finally doing everything my mom had asked but she had given everything and wasn't willing to give anymore to the relationship. 
He met my stepmother and they have always had a really rocky relationship consisting of infidelity (pretty sure only on my dad's side), excessive drinking (mainly my dad), losing/quitting jobs (both my dad and stepmom) and awful financial control. They have never been good at spending money on what they needed to and spending on shit that was completely frivolous (More my stepmom's issue but my dad isn't innocent with this either). 
About 8 years ago, my dad was in a pretty bad accident that caused him to have very severe back problems. They are bad enough that almost every doctor he has seen has told him they refused to go anywhere near him to try any surgery. He is in constant pain and it is not going away. Then about 2 years ago, a relative passed away and left my father a number of old guns. He decided to try one out and the gun exploded in his face. The bolt flew backwards and hit my dad directly below his right eye. He was rushed to the hospital and had numerous emergency surgeries. The doctors told us that had the bolt been 100th of a millimeter closer to his eye, it would've gone straight through his skull and he'd have died. He has not recovered the eyesight in his right eye, has a face made of mesh and titanium and suffers from chronic headaches among other issues due to the accident. Because of both of these incidents my father is unable to work. He has been fighting for disability since the first accident where he incurred his back injuries and has been turned down more times then I can remember. (I am unsure of the reasoning behind the denial for disability) 
In March, my stepmom lost (I don't know if it was considered quitting or if she got fired) her job due to a disagreement with a higher positioned nurse. She has been unable to find work since that and has been denied unemployment. (I do think she should go get a job wherever she can get one but I suppose she feels those jobs are beneath her. I do understand how stupid this line of thinking is when there's so much at stake)
Because they have no income coming in they are behind on all of their utilities and bills and now the mortgage company and the state (I think that's who it is?) property tax office are telling my dad that they have to pay x amount of money or they will lose the house and land. They are scraping to even feed themselves (they have a 12 year old son, my half brother, to care for as well). The house was built by my grandfather, where my dad grew up and where I spent the majority of my childhood. My dad claims that he cannot live anywhere else. (This line of thinking makes me very angry bc, as I understand being attached to something so personal, it is only a house and a piece of land.) 
I think for years my dad has had almost a rainbow effect happening where he didn't truly realize how bad things were getting for them and was looking for the pot of gold at the end of it all. I believe that he is now realizing that he isn't ever going to be a rock star millionaire and he that he doesn't have nearly what a 46 year old man should have by this point in life. The money problems, extremely painful health issues, depression, relationship problems among a slew of other things are really bringing him down to the point that he doesn't feel that he has anywhere to turn anymore. Tonight it got to the worst scenario I have known of this far. He had a gun in hand and was threatening to kill himself.  
I am not sure how to help them anymore. I live almost half way across the country and am recently medically retired from the military. I do not have a job and am a full time student. I make some money from the VA for disability and some from going to school but it's barely enough for me to maintain my life here. I have sent them money in the past and want to help in any way that I can. I have even thought about trying for a loan to purchase the house and land so that they were guaranteed somewhere to live. Without a steady job, (even though it is not ridiculously expensive, only $35,000) no bank would approve me for a mortgage. Being so far away I can't even just go hang out and be there for them. I've thought about trying to find a not for profit family therapist for all three of them to go talk to but wasn't able to locate any in their home area. I have been wracking my brain trying to come up with some way to help and am at a loss. Any one have any ideas that may be of use? Websites? Groups? Anything?        

TL:DR  My father has been having a very hard time lately, (physically, mentally and financially) and tonight threatened suicide. Looking for ways to help from over 1000 miles away.

Sorry in advance for any grammatical errors, English is not my native language.I'll try to keep this as short and objective as possible.I am currently living at home with my mom,my dad and my younger teenaged siblings. In May 2014,I graduated from high school and have been doing a year of voluntary community service since. I plan on entering university in October.The relationship between my mom and I has been unstable for I'd say 2 years. We are both pretty quick-tempered and things often flare up when we argue (yelling, slamming doors, hurtful choice of words). It has always been like that,but the last two years, it has gotten worse. We argue pretty much every week,but almost *always* about petty things.Things have escalated before, her threatening to kick me out, us saying hurtful things or me slamming doors.Usually it's me apologizing first, often just to restore peace,not because I agreed with what she expected me to be sorry for.Now to the actual problem. My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year now and most of the time,things are great between us. On the weekend though, we had a huge fight and he texted me on Monday asking if he could come over to talk and reconcile.So since I was at work when he messaged me,I called my mom to let her know about my bf stopping by.As soon as I told her, she sighed and started complaining that she was already wearing her sweatpants and doesn't want to change but she has to when strangers are coming over.After he had left,I approached my mom about her calling my bf a stranger after a year of dating,and her complaining when he wants to come over. I have to admit, I didn't address this as maturely and calmly as I had wished to, but I was just really upset about it and she really hurt my feelings. Of course,things escalated,I stormed upstairs and went to my bathroom. About five minutes later,my mom knocks on the door and asks me to open the door. I told her I won't open the door right away but I will be out in a minute. She started yelling at me to open the door *right now*,and since I refused to do so, she decided to unlock my door from the outside. To me, that was so disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary,because I told her I'll open the door in a minute! Anyways, she tells me to either apologize for my behavior and talk this out maturely or I will have to move out.(She threatened me before with that).I'm just so sick and tired of arguing with my mom. Sometimes I feel like she enjoys it. It puts a strain on our family and has gotten to the point that I don't even wanna come home anymore, fearing I will say/do something that upsets her.I've tried ending these arguments in all kinds of ways, calm and mature,yelling, apologizing, everything.I don't know what to do anymore. I can't move out,I have no other place to live but I'm so done with apologizing for stuff I don't think is worth being sorry for.How can I deal with my mom's behavior in the future to avoid this constant arguing?

The other day he was teasing me about something fairly minor which he has brought up a lot in the past, and immaturely said something about how I am doing better in school than him, specifically that I could pass tests and that he couldn't (which was not very related to the topic he was teasing me for at all). He has had a rough semester and is usually quite an average student (as am I), but has had a couple bad tests. Within ten seconds I realized what I said was cruel and apologized quite fully, and that what I said was cruel and immature, and it was just being a mean for the sake of it and that I was being an asshole. He didn't exactly accept the apology and was still visibly upset, but we awkwardly talked for a little while before parting ways.

Forward to today, he still seems upset and down about what I said and did not attend our math class, which we were getting a mid term back in. I picked up his test for him and my heart dropped when I saw he did not do very well at all on the test, and I managed to do a little better than average.

I very much need advice on how to procede with this. I understand exactly why he is upset about what I said and how innappropriate it was, but now I have to hand him a shitty test back. Is there anyway I can give him this test without making him more upset than he already is? I feel like me giving him his test back will make it seem like I'm rubbing it in, and that is the last thing I want to do as I regret what I said deeply and do not want him to do poorly on tests. Should I give it to another one of our friends to hand it back? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I can't stand how much my parents try to spoil me and how controlling she is about my whereabouts and every move. I still get lectured every morning on why drugs are bad and how I need to avoid people who do them, as if at 24 I didn't know drugs were bad. They'll snoop through my things and until last year our bank accounts were tied together so they would always monitor that as well. They call me if they think I'm out too late and on weekends will usually stay up until I get home unless I'm staying with my girlfriend. Don't get me wrong, I love them both and they've done so much for me and have provided me with a lot of opportunities that people can only dream of but they are overwhelming and I want to become more independent from them. I have some experience living on my own, I relieved a basketball scholarship and lived for 4 years in Oklahoma. I say some because I didn't have to pay rent and food since that was included and I just worked part time in the summers so I could have spending money. To them that doesn't count as real experience so they've dismissed that even though I've learned how to cook, manage my time effectively, upkeep an apartment and do chores around the apartment. But whatever I gave them that one. 

I talked to them about it once before about 5-6 months ago and they went ballistic. Bringing up scenarios from when I was a kid in high school to prove I'm not ready to move out and things like that. Anyway, since I just started a new job I agreed to let some time go by and settle before talking about this again. And they agreed they would back off. Well I didn't bring it up since but they did not back off at all.

So here we are today and I'm finally going to bring up the conversation again. Financially, I'm ready to move out and by Nov 1st (the estimated move in date) I will have way more than I need saved up. I'm renting not buying by the way. My question in how can I approach them with this? I know the conversation is going to get heated and I need to remain calm and hold my ground but I find it so hard to have a civil conversation with them about things like this.

(Throwaway account)

I'm an Indian male who has been in a long distance relationship with the love of my life for nearly 6 years now. Since we both got employed after studies, my girlfriend decided it was time for us to tell our parents and get married. She told her parents about me while I'm having trouble telling my parents about her.

I come from a moderately orthrodox Tamil Brahmin family. My girlfriend is from kerala and is not a brahmin. While this is totally fine by me, I expect it to cause issues with my parents. Moreover, she is slightly elder to me as well.

I have tried to talk to my dad about jet several times in the past, but every time, i end up thinking of all the possible responses and I end up getting cold feet in the last minute. It's annoying me and my girlfriend to no end. My parents have known her for a while now as my best friend. They don't hate her, but they aren't particularly fond of her either. 

It should be noted that I have never had an open conversation with my parents about love or marriage, as is the case in several tamil families and hence, i don't really know what my parents think. This is yet another reason that has made me virtually in capable of sharing things close to my heart with my parents.

I have seen so many people get great advice here at reddit and I thought I'll post my story to see if anyone here can help me. I would really love to tell me dad about this and move on. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did your parents react? How would you advise me to approach the situation? Anything that may be even remotely useful is welcome.

30021,Non-Romantic,2izs2k,"Hi. This is my first time posting, so I hope I'm in the right place. I think the information below will provide some necessary background. If not, you can just skip down to the TLDR.

I'm 25F, and live in Seattle. I had my daughter when I was 17, and had to pull myself together really quickly in order for us to survive. I buckled down, and graduated high school early with honors, and graduated from college when I was 19. I left high school so fast that I didn't keep up with many of my friends.  Thankfully, my academic scholarships covered my tuition, but I did have to work two jobs to pay the rent and other bills. I'm now a very successful young professional, and me and my daughter are very comfortable. I'm known around my town (small town gossip), and a lot of people respected the fact that I was able to excel even through the hardship I faced when I got pregnant so young. 

I'm now working in a big city, and have created quite a network. My name has gotten out there, and I've created some great professional networking relationships, which has contributed greatly to my success. I've also always had a very successful dating life. I have had 2 serious relationships, and I'm currently in one at the moment. He's deployed. Even the shorter relationships were pretty healthy, ended on good terms, and I always seemed to learn something from them. I get along great with my family, and we are all close. 

For some reason, I've never had a best friend. I have three friends that I met at work a few years ago, but I wouldn't call it a genuine friendship. It's never lunch, getting a coffee, or getting our kids together. We don't talk in between hangouts. I usually get a text late on Friday night when one of them wants to go drinking. Even though I'm the youngest of the group, I always end up babysitting. Every time one of them has said they'd drive, they end up drinking too much. Now it's just assumed that I will drive. 

 I know a lot of people will say to stop hanging out with them, but by the time my off weekend comes (when my daughter is at her dads), I'm craving some adult conversation. I want to get out of the house, unload, and talk about my week. I don't need a full on conversation most of the time, I just want to decompress. I've reached out to them in times of need. My daughter is autistic and sometimes we have bad weeks. I came out of a 5 year relationship a couple years ago and it was very hard, and I reached out to them. They weren't there to talk for more than a few minutes, and it always was over text. It seemed like they just didn't care. I've become conditioned that people don't care about your problems anymore, so now I just don't reach out to the people around me, and it's made it impossible for me to form new relationships. My self-esteem is completely shot, so I just stick with the shitty friends I have now. 

Once in a while, I'll try organize something on my own to get my friends together. Around my birthday, I'll try and plan a night out so we can all get together. The last three years, something has come up and my friends couldn't come out. This year, I tried putting something together. My boyfriend is deployed, it's been a rough couple of months with my daughter, and I just wanted to get out of the house. One friend doesn't want to go because she doesn't like the bar (it's too clubby for her), and the other doesn't want to go because she has her daughter this weekend (she lives with her parents, and has tons of friends with kids. She didn't even attempt to find a sitter). So today is my birthday, I don't have my daughter, and I'm sitting at home alone...third year in a row. I'm beyond lonely, and I just need someone to call when I'm bored, happy, sad, or maybe something in between....the occasional friend I guess. I'm not a needy person, so I definitely don't think I'm doing anything wrong outside of excusing their bad behavior for too long, and letting it become habit.

I don't know where to go from here. Should I just ditch these friends? or tell them how I'm feeling? Should I just keep trying to get out there and make new ones?

This post is a mess, and I know this is petty, but I don't know where else to go.

My mother recently got me a concert ticket to my favorite artist for Christmas. It's the only thing I wanted, and it's really like only my 3rd concert in my life. This time, it's my favorite artist of all time. I live on my own, and my bills pretty much suck the life out of my wallet on a biweekly basis. I told my mother when the show was, and when the tickets went on sale. I even bookmarked the site on her computer. 

A few days later, I go back on the site, and notice that pretty much all the halfway decent seats are sold out. I called my girlfriend (who works with my mother) and told her that, pretty bummed out. My mother overheard the conversation, and real quickly bought tickets, but for seats somewhere nowhere near where I wanted to be. She forgot about the day tickets went on sale. 

Now, I know I sound like a brat, but this artist is special to me on a lot of different levels, especially when it comes to my girlfriend. She keeps telling me that I sound like a 16 year old girl on that god awful Sweet Sixteen show on MTV who got the wrong color Lexus, but... I think it goes deeper than that. 

My mother and I have a complicated relationship. I'm a child of an early divorce. I have an older brother, but he moved in with my dad when I was 10, and so pretty much, I've been raised by a workaholic single mother, and have pretty much played second fiddle to her needs ever since. She hasn't been a terrible mother, as she did a great job keeping the roof over my head, and food on the table, and I've always appreciated that, but I've always been *very* resentful about how non-attentive she was. I never really learned how to do chores, or the value of a dollar, or how to manage basic hygiene as a teenager, and because of that, I became an angry, resentful little late-bloomer, carrying a heavy load of emotional and mental problems (that are admittedly workable, but shitty to deal with nonetheless). 

When she got me the ticket, in passing, she got very meh seats, and while I appreciate the fact that I'm going to see this artist, I just feel really bad vibes from the entire thing. I feel like these tickets I have are shrouded in the weight of the resentment I feel toward my mother about these tickets, while on the *other* hand, I feel like an ungrateful little brat, with an attitude that's far, far, far beneath that of an independent 25 year old grown ass man with bills to pay. 

I've been working through all these childhood problems I've developed, but it's really difficult to work on the resentment I have with my mother, despite all she's done for me financially. This is definitely not a /r/raisedbynarcissists issue, because she's not a narcissist. She's the victim of HER NMom, who threw her out at 16 to start a new life with some abusive fuckhead, which drained any chance of my mother raising an emotionally well-adjusted person. 

I don't blame her, but my anger is directionless. I don't even know where to begin paying for therapy, as I make scraps at my current job, not even enough to afford Obamacare. 

Sitting down and having a heart-to-heart with my mother doesn't work, because it just ends with my anger getting the best of me, and me being accused of thinking she was a terrible mother. 

I don't know where this anger comes from. I just know I need help. I need to learn how to accept gifts properly, and I need to learn how to let go of all this anger without feeling like I'm just lying to myself in order to make it feel better. 

There's some pretty meh feelings about making this a special event for my girlfriend, that's gonna get diluted by the fact that we're sitting in the aisle seat in a weird section, but it's nothing compared to everything else I'm feeling.

For the past couple of months, I've been suspicious that my Mom is depressed. She talks about how she's unhappy with her and my fathers marriage, and has also mentioned how divorce would be the 'easy way out'... I had no idea things were that bad between them until she said that.. I know that after my father had heart surgery, his personality flipped and he became way more cold but.. I didn't know to what extent, considering I no longer live with my parents.


Also, today while I was over at their house doing laundry, she mentioned how she didn't shower or go to the store yet (it was around noon) because she's depressed, but whatever. That's when it hit me; I realized that there's little things she had said over the past couple of months that kind of showed that she would feel this way...


I have absolutely no idea how to help her... I know that my dad is more than likely oblivious to how she feels.. also, the fact that she works at the hospital in the renal department (and absolutely hates her job as a CNA) probably isn't helping either..

I guess he spent some time working on it (I didn't know this) and had some issues with work so he types out this huge paragraph about how I'm a cynical asshole and he's done with my bullshit, cancels the weekly group altogether and no ones heard from him since. Like I said this is a usually monthly occurence but I move Thursday and I don't know if I should just let it go and wait until he becomes more of an adult or if this is anything that might be my responsibility to fix.

30091,Non-Romantic,2qjsgo,"I doubt she reddits, but I'm changing the names here regardless. I'm Ava in this story, my friend will be Pam.



Ava and Pam grew up together. They know each other's secrets and appear to really care about the other's well-being. When they get older, it's time to move out. 



Pam grew up in a horrible situation. Her mother moved her to more schools than she could remember, and was a meth addict. It was hard to hold on to steady grades when her world outside of school was already so unsteady. 



Ava had a fairly normal childhood. They had a lot of kids in the family and only one working parent, so they never had a lot of money, but they had an intact family. 



When it came time to move out, Pam really wanted to leave her terrible situation and move in with her best friend, Ava. Ava still wasn't 100% sold on the idea of living with Pam. 



Pam is a lot of fun, but Ava like's privacy and peace more so than Pam. But, Ava decided to move in with Pam because she trusted Pam to give her space when she needed it. And she did.



They lived together for a year, and it was a very normal roommate experience for the both. Neither of the girls cleaned to the other's liking, and they both got on each other's nerves. Very normal for a roommate situation. 



Towards the end of the lease, both girls are in serious relationships. Ava is happy that Pam has found someone who is genuinely nice and will help take care of her. 



Pam approves of Ava's new boyfriend and all seems well. Ava then decided that she wants to move into the same city as her new serious boyfriend, so they can be closer. Pam is a little sad that Ava doesn't want to live with her and her serious boyfriend, but Ava is ready for that privacy she values so much. 



The last few weeks of their lease isn't the prettiest. Pam is upset that Ava is leaving, and that she won't clean her bedroom and bathroom she was living in. 



Ava is feeling annoyed that Pam is making demands on how the house be left. Ava reads the lease, knows that her room and bathroom don't have to be cleaned, and leaves with them messy. 



The girls also had an agreement about a painting that a friend of Pam's painted. Ava tried to get Pam to have her friend paint it on a canvas, so they could save the painting and not have to worry about painting over the wall when they Moved.



Pam wasn't having it, and it went right up on the wall. When it came time to clean the wall up, Pam didn't want to give up her Saturday night of partying. Saturday night was the only time Ava had to paint the wall before the end of their lease. 



Because Pam went to party instead of clean, Ava decided to just leave her half of what the supplies would cost. Ava didn't feel like it was her responsibility to paint the wall herself. 



Fast forward a few weeks and things start to unravel. Ava finds out that Pam lied to her about the resolution of the painting on the wall. 



Pam told Ava that she painted it herself, and had to hunt all over the city to find the special, right paint that the apartments needed. So in the end it costed her more, so she needed more money from Ava so that their payment halves would be equal. 



Ava finds out that Pam never painted the wall, and never hunted for special paint. 



Ava calls the apartment complex and finds out that Pam had agreed to let the Apartment community paint over it, and expected Ava to help her foot that bill without asking. 



Pam then tells Ava that they owe $800 to the apartment complex because Ava left her room and bathroom trashed. 



Ava suspects something is off here, because she read the lease herself and knew that there were no charges for a messy bedroom and bathroom. 



Ava calls the apartment complex again, and asks for an itemized list of all the charges the two of the girls owed. 



The apartment goes through the details, telling Ava that they are charged to replace carpets due to pet damage (Pam had a pet, never paid pet fees. Ava had 2 pets, always paid pet fees) also being charged because the oven wasn't clean. 



They also told Ava that they owed $75 less than what Pam had told her. 



They mentioned nothing of a bedroom or bathroom causing a fee. Ava even asked to be sure 'So no charge for a dirty bedroom or bathroom?' They confirmed this. 



Hmm... so now Ava is feeling a bit lied too, and annoyed. But she decides to brush all this off. She understands that Pam had a rough life growing up, and understands that she doesn't make the best decisions sometimes and loves her regardless.



A few more weeks goes by and Ava still hasn't given Pam her half of the 800 dollars owed at the end of their lease. 



Ava meets up with Pam at a bar to give her the cash. And tells Pam that she isn't drinking to save money. Pam generously offers to buy her drinks that night. Ava thinks this is so nice of Pam and enjoys herself.



Another 2 weeks goes by, and Ava gets a call from her apartment complex. It's been almost 2 months since Ava has moved from the apartments so she knows something is up. Why else would they call?



Ava hears a voicemail about how Pam never paid the last bill. Now two months old.



 The apartment community now threatens Ava with being sent to collections. Ava is shocked, she gave her money to Pam 2 weeks ago, and assumed it was paid. She begs the apartment for just one more week, desperate to not have a black mark on her credit score. 



Ava knows that credit scores affect a lot in life, cars, houses, jobs... She was nervous. She was only 21 years old and didn't want to start off her credit so poorly. 



Ava grew up watching her parents live paycheck to paycheck, watching them struggle with poor credit. Ava works hard every single day to make sure she pays bills on time, goes to school, and builds a future for herself. 



Ava is feeling betrayed by Pam. Pam knew how important credit is to Ava and she was going to tarnish it for 7 years and didn't even tell her. All the while, Pam is buying alcohol, weed, and gifts for her boyfriend. Leaving Ava in the dust, not caring about her future at all. (At least, that's how Ava saw it)



Ava calls Pam, to ask her why she didn't tell her about the unpaid bill.
 Pam is unapologetic, saying she didn't think she had to tell Ava what was going on. Ava is fed up. This is her future, her life. And someone so close to her is willing to sabotage it. 



Ava then hears how Pam told their circle of friends about what a terrible person Ava was to live with. How awful Ava is in general and how Ava cares about nothing except her new serious boyfriend.



Ava is even more fed up. Pam is a liar, and has been for years. But Pam did no damage to Ava's reputation among friends. The friends saw through Pam's lies. 



So now Ava is left feeling sabotaged by her longtime friend, Pam. 



Pam gives a forced apology. Claims that lying about the amount of money the two girls owed was a mistake. Claims she heard them wrong. Never admits to what Ava saw as a lie. 



Pam continues to quitely talk shit about Ava to their circle. It of course, always makes it's way back to Ava. 



Ava and Pam have fought in the past. But Ava realizes that their past fights were always about kid things. Boys, plans for friday nights, outfits, etc... 



Ava realizes that the two are now 21 and 22, growing up and entering the real world. Ava wants to make sure her future is bright, and wants to continue to work hard everyday to make sure she doesn't have to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle like her parents. Ava is feeling unsure on if she should still have Pam in her life at this point.



Pam and Ava hang out a few times after the incident happens... and Ava just doesn't feel right. Ava doesn't want to share her life with Pam anymore. She feels awkward and uncomfortable being around Pam and it dawns on Ava that she hasn't truly forgiven Pam. 



Ava doesn't think she can forgive Pam. Ava still gets so mad when she thinks about what happened between the two. Ava still feels betrayed. Hurt. Lied to. Cheated. All by someone she believe truly cared about her.



Pam is now married with a new baby, and won't stop asking Ava to meet her new baby. The girls were friends for 18 years. But Ava doesn't want to be back in Pam's life. Ava is still angry about what happened a year ago. But now, Ava is questioning on if this anger is the right response. Ava knows how lonely Pam must be, Pam doesn't have many real friends. 


Should Ava forgive Pam and be her friend again?

I can't remember how many times we talked about relationships and they types of people we thought we'd be and the types of people we thought we'd marry. 

I'm confused because I saw the people he invited, and I'm at a loss as to why I was left out. I'm so upset, I unfriended him on FB (I know, I know I'm five) and just didn't say anything. 

So I'm posting today because here we are several weeks after the wedding and B calls me. I text him I'm in a meeting - I needed to stall, no idea how to handle this. He says ok. I get myself together and text back What's up? (Why? No idea.)  He replies I was in a place where I had some time to call and catch up, so I decided to call. 

As of this post I haven't responded. 

I'm hurt, and furious, and I honestly don't know if there is anything he could say or do at this point besides rewind time to fix our relationship.

**tl;dr**: My lifelong friend didn't invite me to his wedding. I'm pretty butthurt about it. What do?


Edit: This has nothing to do with his wife. She is not jealous of me. It doesn't matter that I've never met her - most of his friends from around here haven't met her. Our friendship has not fizzled out over time - we graduated a couple of years ago and speak on the phone every couple of months to say hello and chat. Last I heard, wedding planning was going great and there was no indication I wouldn't be invited. Responses arguing that she's jealous or that we just aren't close anymore are not helpful. Please stop bashing his wife. 

Update: Thankfully I have a bit of time to think about this as both of us were too busy this evening to get to chat. Thank you for all the suggestions. He's my friend. I'm sure he had his reasons. I'm upset, but I value the friendship so I'm going to find some way to approach this to maintain the relationship.

30133,Non-Romantic,1yv28n,"Some background: My mother is going through a rough patch in her life; therefore, her anger issues (which usually fluctuate) are consistently present and have an adverse affect on my family (step dad/ step sister 27/ brother #1 12/ brother #2 4). To keep this short my mom, for years, has verbally abused brother #1 who has mild Aspergers (a form of autism, you can learn more at psych central if you wish). She constantly bombards him with comments that follow along the lines of you're a failure/retarded/useless/ etc. Any time in the past that I've tried to defend him resulted in my mom telling me to mind my business and ultimately targeting me after her rant to him. 

The latest bashing to my brother occurred three days ago (2/21/14) and it followed along the lines of I don't know where I fucked up raising you. You should be more like your sister. Your such a fucking liar, so useless. etc. In no way am I smart and my brother will easily be smarter than me once he gets to the point in his life where I am so it's ridiculous that she said these things to him. My boyfriend was over at the time so I didn't say anything to stop her and I wasn't looking to be put in the crossfire. After my boyfriend left I went up to my brother to comfort him and tell him he wasn't a failure and what not. My mother saw me do this, so when she was driving me to work but five minutes later she asked what I had said to him. I replied that I was telling him not to feel bad for what she had said to him and she immediately went on the defense. The argument lasted the whole fifteen minutes to my work place. The argument was controlled, nobody raised their voices, but I explained to her as calmly as I could that it's not okay for her to abuse him like this, if she keeps it up he's going to go into a depression/contemplate suicide. She said she felt like shit for talking to him like that, but her anger gets the best of her and that he deserves it sometimes because of the way he acts (my brother is extremely lazy/ procrastinates/ and is a consistent liar). Basically she said I know I shouldn't say those things, I feel bad for doing it, BUT he deserves it 

After my shift ended my step dad picked me up, this was the fun fight, he immediately began chewing me out for criticizing my mother. He said that because I wasn't under as much stress as they are, raising a family/bills/daily stressors of an adult, that I had no right to tell my mother to not talk to my brother the way she does. He took her side in saying that he deserves it. Mind you we were screaming and shouting the whole ride, he told me that I thought I was the smartest person in the family, that I cant be bothered with them, and that I'm basically above them (all for saying my brother deserves better treatment) I was completely awestruck that he said these things about me (which were similar to what my mom said about me in our fight) The most painful to hear was a comment he made about my religion. 

Quick side story about my religion: I was baptized as a baby, but received no further sacraments from the Catholic church because my mom never took me (or my brother). My freshman year of high school (currently a senior) my friend invited me to youth group at a non-denominational Christian church. I've consistently gone to youth group since then and some times service. In previous fights my step dad has made comments that I don't go to youth group to strengthen my faith, that I just go to socialize (I let these comments roll off my back). A few times my sophomore year I had my family go to service but they didn't like the atmosphere so I didn't pressure them to go anymore. I've recently began going to mass with my boyfriend, which may or may not annoy my step dad because in the past I've criticized the Catholic church from ignorance. In no way have I ever told my family you need to read your bible/pray/ go to service. I simply allow them to believe and do what they want while I exercise my religious freedoms. The only thing that I say about my religion is just asking permission to go to youth group/mass. Side story over.

The comment my step dad made was that I throw my religion in peoples faces in my house and that I believe I'm a better Christian, etc. I curtly responded how do I do that, in which he had no response and then proceeded that I break some of the ten commandments and that before I harp about my religion that I need to fix that. I'm completely baffled because I do not ever speak about my religion and how I practice it to my family. I tried x amount of years ago to get them to go to church, they responded poorly so I stopped.

 I can't let go of this comment so now I feel uncomfortable asking my mom permission to go to mass in front of my step dad, and I feel like when I do have to ask permission or bring up anything about youth group, I feel like he's scrutinizing me. How can I express to him that his comments about my religion were unwanted, un-called for, and overall a complete negative impact on me.

30135,Non-Romantic,2m75gn,"I lurk around here a lot, but now it is my turn to ask for help.

About 4 years ago I left home for college across the country. I got a job upon graduation in the same town around January 2014. They helped me get setup here and gifted me the car i drove in high school. 

At about the same time my parents bought a condo about an hour away from me as kind if a vacation home setting up for retirement. So i've been helping them out with getting it all set up. Painting, furniture shopping/setup, having packages mailed to me to bring with me. But most importantly, I take my little brother [16M] out of their hair for a few hours each time. Take him on the town usually spending a decent chunk of money. So I'd say i'm being extraordinarily helpful.

Now, the main issue. They want to take a full-week cruise in May 2015. And they need someone to babysit my brother (mentally he is not his age, and its really hard to trust him on his own.) My sister [25] lives at hone but cant work her schedule around school buses and dinner and whatnot. My older brother [29 in another part of the country] and sister do not get along at all. Throats would be slit by the end of the week. So they asked me. They seem to think I already agreed to it, but I dont ever remember speaking to them about it and neither does my SO [21F, 2 years].

So they are asking me to take a week off work to have 2 multi-plane flights to babysit (theyd pay the tickets). Thats a big request IMO. Taking the time off isn't hard where I work, but that is still a decent chunk of my yearly amount (2.5 weeks). And on top of that, I would miss my SOs birthday which is a big deal to her. She likes spending a weekend just fucking around enjoying herself. And I want to be there with her.

So when they asked me to babysit, I asked if we could discuss it more next time they were at the condo (this upcoming weekend). They flipped out and assumed I was outright saying no. Saying things like I'm dissapointed you won't help us after we helped you. So we argued for a bit, I was calmy giving my reasons for why I need to think about it. Then my dad gave his be all end all statement... dont bother. Which means no matter what happens, I won't be the one to help them here, even if I decide I would go.

I'm not a confrontational person, but my dad and I are incredibly stubborn which results in these arguments often. I feel like they aren't respecting me as an adult, free to make my own choices. I should be allowed to say no to them now. And I help them out almost every month ir two with the condo! So I don't know why they think I'm being unhelpful. And I want them to understand where I'm coming from on these issues.

I just am having trouble thinking of a way to tell them all this when I see them on Saturday. In a way that won't get everyone yelling.

My apologies for formatting, spelling, or rambling. I am on mobile and still kind of flustered at this whole thing. Will give more details if needed.

Anyway, so I was in the common room eating breakfast yesterday when the landlord walks in with the new guy, doing the tour/contract signing. 

He just got into the country the day before and he has a lot of stuff to do, but he doesn't know the area, and he can't speak the language almost at all. I spend the day showing him around and translating with various clerks and government officials for him. He seems really nice and he was really grateful for all my help.

At some point he asks me if he can use my SIM card to check and see if his foreign bought phone is going to work. I'm really uncomfortable in general about other people and my phone, but I'm not sure I'm definitely against it yet so I demur, because it looks like we'll be spending more time together anyway I think I can decide later.

While we're at the government office (I had to go anyway to get some tax documentation), and we're both at our windows getting our bureaucracy on, he comes up and says he needs to call his manager for the new job to get some info and can he use my phone. I'm still not totally comfortable with that but I punch in the password and then enter the number he tells me before handing him the phone. 

I'm going to try to keep an eye on him, but the tax stuff ends up not being simple like I naively thought it would be and he disappears at some point while I'm talking to the lady in the window. He comes back in later, and gives me my phone. I don't think much at the time, and my attention is still hijacked by bureaucracy so I just put the phone back in my purse. 

The day continues, I help him trying to get a new phone since apparently his won't work, and we end up taking the metro one stop to go to a different phone store. Afterwards, he buys me dinner as a thank you and we split up at the mall so I can go sit in a cafe and try to get a little work done. 

He was nice so I'm actually thinking about whether it's a good idea to ask him out on a date, when I take out my phone to use an app for the first time since the afternoon. (I've been so busy talking and such that I haven't done more than check the time and look one thing up on Google since then).

I see that there's an error, and when I check it says my SD card is not in the phone. I open the case (the battery also seems to be not totally in properly) and the card is still there, but sure enough it's been popped out of it's slot. As if someone had, for example, mistaken it for a SIM card on the first try and neglected to push it in securely when they were finished. 

I'm pretty sure that that can't just happen on it's own. I immediately felt extremely hurt that he would go ahead and open up my phone after I didn't tell him it was OK. 

I might be overreacting but I don't think I can feel as comfortable around him as I did before. I will probably wind up saying something but I don't know how to approach this with him. Any advice on having as non-confrontational a confrontation as possible? He just got here, so I don't know if he's the type to hang out in the common room but if he is it's not like I'll be able to avoid seeing him and I don't want this to make things weird or awkward. 

*Also because people might ask, to my knowledge there wasn't anything compromising on the card. There were some pictures of me in my bathing suit, but it's a conservative one-piece I wear for swimming laps and I was going to post them online later anyway.

30152,Non-Romantic,2qrm1r,"My (ex)husband and I were in a relationship from December 2006 until about Dec 2013 (got married in August 2011 and had our first kid in March 2012).

I work weekends which means I don't always get to go to family functions but we would get together every month or so and I would go to the events when possible. My SIL was at our wedding, every Thanksgiving, etc. I played with her kids. We exchanged Christmas presents. She even, voluntarily, of her own decision, without my or my ex's prompting, arranged my baby shower in 2012. 

When my husband and I split, it was after a super complicated relationship but VERY friendly (the split had NOTHING to do with anyone finding another partner or cheating or anything of that sorts). My ex finally told his family in May of 2014 even though I hadn't been really living with him since January.

I found my SIL had deleted me off of Facebook not long after. I wasn't bothered. I thought at the time maybe she was upset that my ex and I had split though from my perspective, my ex and I were still super friendly. 

I did not go to Thanksgiving this year as I usually host and my ex told his dad to host instead (I was pissed -- but that's another story) and so I decided to not make things awkward and to just hold my own with my family. It went well and my ex was there too. I made sure the events were at different time so my ex could take our daughter to both.

On this last Friday, we all went to our city's Christmas lights at the zoo event. SIL completely ignored me. I mean, not just like not looking at me. She was beyond that -- at one point she picked up my kid and carried her away to somewhere else to talk to her. I was really confused but just tried to have a good time and not allow her to poison my night. My ex and kid and I left when we all wanted to and went home.

My ex finally asked his sister what was going on with her and she told him the following:

* SIL had never liked me, even from the beginning, and thought I was horrible to him 
* she was just being polite on Friday by not talking to me (I have no idea but holy shit was it awkward)
* she had no idea why we broke up as ex was the perfect husband (obviously not)
* she almost didn't go to Thanksgiving (that I was not at) because *she* wasn't ready to see *me* (what the fuck?)

Now thankfully, my ex stood up for me. He told me that he actually was pissed at his sister for her being upset at me. He said this was none of her business and that she shouldn't be mad at me for some perceived slight against him that doesn't even exist. He also told her he's not perfect.

**Here's my issue:** I feel extremely betrayed by this revelation from her that she *never* liked me (she fucking *ARRANGED MY BABY SHOWER* and now I can't stop thinking about how she hated me during that). We never had a fight before, never were close but we seemed to get along when we were together. I give no fucks what she thinks about how my ex and I broke up because she has no idea (she didn't even know we had an open relationship), but I am upset that she is acting like we never got along and I'm really worried about her continuing to cause my ex drama. He was upset about his sister's attitude toward me.

They are talking on Friday face to face. I just get sick when I think about how for the past 8 years she has hated me and was talking poorly about me. I also get upset when I know that my ex and SIL are going to be talking about me. I assumed his family disliked me after we split but not the entire 8 years? Ugh.

Essentially I'm wondering what you all think about how to make sure the ex gets the least amount of drama. I wanted to message her and tell her how upset it made me but I don't think it'll help. I told him I really don't want her at my house and I would prefer her not to see our daughter unless I'm there, but I'm not sure what else to do. I don't want to do nothing because I might go crazy with not expressing myself about this, but if overwhelming support says to just shut up and let them deal with it, then I will.


**tl;dr**: ex-SIL told my ex (after ex and I split with no ill feelings) that she has never liked me and that he was the perfect husband. I want to minimize drama as I don't want ex to be annoyed but I also don't know if I can just let this go.

30194,Non-Romantic,1yakav,"Background (sorry for all the text!): I have a weird relationship with my dad. It's practically non-existent but due to some ingrained cultural traditions (I'm Chinese), I still feel the need to be pleasant and respectful to him. Growing up, he never really liked me very much and I had a pretty crappy childhood. He's also an extremely selfish and prideful person. When I was maybe 5 or 6, he lost $100 and assumed I stole it. I got the living shit kicked out of me and then he found it.. in a pair of pants. No apologies, just laughed. For 1.5 years when I was 14, he ignored my presence completely and refused to be in room with me.. so I ate dinner by myself during that entire time. I think it was because I lied about where my report card was or something. He always called me my mom's daughter and acted like he had nothing to do with me. My parents divorced at 16 and I was much better off with my mom.

Anyways, my grandparents (dad's side) raised me for about 4 years when I was young. It was fun, I liked them a lot. However, after the divorce, my grandparents seemingly forgot I existed because I went with my mom. When I was 18, I went to China for a trip and my mom took me to Shanghai to see my grandparents. The entire time, they bashed my mom and acted like she was abusing me, asking if she fed me, was nice to me, bought me presents, etc (which she does.. obviously). They said my mom had brainwashed me and all my current and future success is because of my dad.. and basically trashed her for the entire time I was there. It was infuriating but I kept quiet since they were old and it's impolite in Chinese culture to talk back to your elders.. but it's not like they would believe me anyways. 

So fast forward a couple years and my grandpa passes away. I was never mentioned in the will for anything and he left my dad 70% of his assets/houses and gave his wife 25%.. and his sister 5%. My dad managed to convince my grandma to hand over all her money over to him so he can watch it so she essentially needs him to buy her large items and he gives her an allowance. He convinced my grandpa to leave his sister out of the will for the most part because she was rich and he was poor. He's not poor. I know exactly how much he makes (six figures) since he works for my mom's boyfriend (weird, I know..) who I'm very close to. The houses my grandpa left him are worth millions, and he recently sold one for half a million in cash. His new wife's family also gave him 2 houses as a dowry so.. he's really not close to poor. He told my grandpa he was so poor he was still driving this old dodge caravan from 1990's.. which we sold.. in the 1990's. 

Recently, he conned me into buying my grandma a cell phone. I don't really mind buying the cellphone but he literally tricked me. My grandma was too scared to ask him for a cellphone (wanted to use WeChat) for her 80th birthday but he found out through his sister.. then chats me up and tells me it's her birthday and says well.. since you're working now, I think you should buy her something. Oh how about a simple basic cellphone for elders? Oh I'm at the store now, there's no basic phones but there's smart phones here that cost 5x the amount. He knew from the get go that she needed a smart phone.. you get the idea. 

After asking me to pay for the smart phone, he's now asking me to pay for my grandpa's grave marker+related things in a nice cemetery because my grandparents raised me (I also think this is more of a favor to the parents than anything.. but maybe I'm wrong). I know he asked my aunt and she rejected him because he got everything in the will and also because it's the son's duty (in China) to pay for the grave marker/burial costs. I don't feel like I should have to pay for this. Am I wrong for thinking this? If I'm not, what's the best way to respond (in a civil/respectable manner). I feel like I'm being used and if I don't stand my ground now, he's going to randomly guilt me into paying for more things. He's also asked me twice now and is guilting me. The overall cost is probably $2-3k and while I can afford it.. it feels wrong to be paying for this in this manner. I would like to not burn bridges since he has a daughter (my half sister) that I would like to maintain a relationship with. Thanks in advance for your help!

30198,Non-Romantic,1yiuya,"Our friendship began the first week of University. To say the least, it was a great friendship. Although she can be superficially flattering, I know she once described me as the best friend she made at University / one of her best friends period / someone she wants in her life forever.

Thing is, I had a thing for her. I didn't tell her until our second year, because she's gay and has a history of neglecting / abandoning friends who develop feelings for her. When I told her, she pretended it wouldn't change anything, but really she was becoming distant. 

This distance evolved. We used to hang out on campus a lot, go into town, always go out together, spend time at each others houses.

Right now, we don't do any of that. We don't do anything, at all. We'll only see each other because we hang out with the same people. 

In recent weeks, we're just upsetting each other. We're always out together, since we share all the same friends. I don't even know why I go out now, because one of us ends up getting upset.

One week, I remember her even being upset with me most days of that week - just the days we had met up. 

Recently, she seems to actively be hurtful or inconsiderate. 

You were worried about being a disappointing friend? Great job tonight, then ! 

^ An example of something she said, knowing it would hurt me, as I confided in her about how much I worry about disappointing friends. In this example, she didn't even have enough faith to hear what I had to say before 'punishing' me. She literally told me she thought I deserved to worry about what I did, and went as far as to persuading one of my best friends not to pick up the phone when I needed him.

Of course, after knowing what actually happened, she apologised. 

Situations like this seem so common now.

On a much less significant note, she recently seems to be extraordinarily flirtatious with our guy-friends. I wouldn't note this, except it's been pointed out to me that it must feel inconsiderate. I don't blame her, but she seems to be putting so much effort into it.

On the occasions we're out and we're not hurting each other, it just feels so artificial talking to her. Nothing flows naturally or comfortably any more.

Now I'm thinking, this friendship is full of so much pretence that I shouldn't really care. Last night, we were out with some friends and we didn't really converse the entire night. When she caught me free to talk to, the things she said felt so superficial. 

She tried making a serious point with me about how I should learn Spanish if I'm not going to learn French, since she can speak both.

She told me she wanted to take MDMA (Ecstasy) again, something we've only ever done in a group of very close friends.

But these things felt so imposed, so artificial that I couldn't really respond comfortably.

What I'm really concerned about, is how to managed everything. Considering we always go out together (sharing the same friends), and ending up upsetting each other.

Gloria and I are two peas in a pod. Someone called her my daughter once and she didn't correct them. I know she does not get the attention she deserves at home, she is one of three kids and not the favorite. So she is looking for someone to be the mother figure she needs. 

She is also very smart and jumped ahead a few grades, which makes it hard for her to make friends her age. So when I show interest in her paintings or poetry, she almost cries. She is not abused but I know her interests are second to her brother's illness. 

I love my nephew (13) and my other niece (11) but Gloria and I have a real connection that is hard to turn off. I do things with Rob (nephew) and Joana (niece) but they don't like the same things I enjoy, so I am never as passionate about a football game or cartoon movie. 

I try, really hard, but Gloria is the daughter I never had. Joanna has a close relationship with her aunt on her father's side. So each child has someone who champions them. 

Now, here is the issue at hand.

Rob's illness is not terminal but he needs a lot of TLC. The area we are in has done all they can for him and now my sister is talking about uprooting the whole family.

Gloria and Joanna do not want to leave, and they go to great schools. Gloria has a real chance at getting into a prestigious high school if she remains in the school she is now. 

My sister has asked me to take both Joanna and Gloria. She will pay for them to stay with me. This would be until Rob either gets better (not sure that will happen) or they hit high school. Even then she is willing to pay for me to parent them through high school as well. 

I would love to have Gloria with me. It would not be a hassle and my husband loves her. But Joanna and I do not get on well and I do not want to make the time for her. I know it sounds cruel, and it might be, but Joanna is a lot of energy and effort that I just don't want to put forth. 

My sister has said it would crush Joanna not to let her remain here, as she has friends. But Gloria and Joanna has never gotten on well. They fight like dogs and cats. 

Having grown up with tons of siblings myself, I felt like my interests were never as important as my older sisters. So, I want to give Gloria the chance to be her own person without Joanna (who is considered the 'pretty one' which is bull, but my sister uses that a lot) around. 

My sister has pretty much said, Whichever you want to keep, go right ahead but I know she would be happier if she had no children, which she has also said. Rob is her attention grabber and Joanna takes too much attention for herself, which is a problem. 

Other family members have offered to take Joanna, but they are not in the same area. So either way Joanna would be leaving an area she loves.

I’m a 19 year old guy who’s working until I can afford college and I recently had a chance to repair things with my ex best friend but I feel I may have biffed (messed up) by going too quickly.



My best friend is a 20 year old university student that is studying criminology; she wants to be a cop, that’s somewhat important.



We have been great friends since high school. We were both super nerdy drama kids that had a class together. 
She was a grade older than me but we didn’t really care our friendship was based on common interests. We would spend a good four to five days a week hanging out together playing video games or just talking. We like the same shows, movies, games and even comic books so the friendship was pretty good. 
We were almost attached at the hip inside an outside of school, allot of jokes about us dating but we kind of awkwardly laughed them off.  We would text each other for hours in class and at home. It got to the point where I convinced my math teacher to let me skip class to hang out with her (My math teacher liked me allot).

We have broken the friendship off once before when I became romantically interested in her. It was my fault I was too aggressive, straightforward, and I lacked subtlety. She wanted to just be friends and I wouldn’t settle for that which made going out more awkward than I realised.
We didn’t talk for a bit, but we were still in high school so we saw each other almost every day so I had plenty of chances tone things down and make up.

Later that year we are back to being great friends. I was still interested in her but I knew she didn’t want a relationship so I pursued other girls at our school.

Things got better when I actually set her up to date one of my friends who was interested in her long story. They dated and seem happy together. Then two weeks later stopped because she’s unsure and felt off about it. I know how much they like each other so I convince her to try again. 
Turns out my friend is a total douche to her, really controlling over what she can do and is a prick to her in public. One day she decides to hang out at my house and she gets a text from him asking if she wants to come over and have some “fun” they’ve only returned to dating 3 weeks now and says she can’t. He asks why she can’t she says she’s with a friend and isn’t really interested.  He asks whose she’s with, she answers me offhandedly, and then he demands to know where she is. 
To cut the fat off the story, we end up going to his house to talk to him, he acts like ass and she dumps him there and then and goes back home with me. She spends the rest of the night with her head on my lap not talking which is worrying me.


She drives home and the next day life returns to the way it was before except she acts different around me.
Really clingy and close. When we hung out she would often position herself in some way that was mildly sexual. Example being one time I was laying on my couch reading and when she walked into the room she took the book out of my hands and just layed on top of me. Now all the way sexual kind of lounging but spread legs so that I was missionary but with her on top (is that a thing?).
She starts kissing me on the cheek or holding my hand around the school. I feel really uncomfortable about this because of the recent break up with my friend and I only feel like she doing this to get back at him. 
He was her first boyfriend so I also felt that maybe I was a rebound even though they only dated a grand total of a month.

During this time I was going to the gym and starting to hang out with the more popular kids at school. I started to bulk up and joined some of the sports teams. I got invited to many parties and usually they were pretty fun. I was experimenting allot with partying and my best friend was somewhat aware of my new friends and parting but wasn’t aware of the extent.

However one party I was having a bad day at work so I decided to get massively drunk. I tried more than just booze too. I’m almost passed out when I look for my driver who got me to the party. I see that he is also in the same condition as me and I may be dumb but I’m not letting him drive me home.
I begin to panic I can’t phone my parents because they are out of town and even if they were I’m sure they would have killed me for being so stupid. I don’t have any other friends who could drive so I called her. She came sometime later and could see how out of it I was. I could tell she was mad she wants to be a police officer and is a completely against teenage drinking and having fun.
She drops me off at home and I say thanks and she asks if she can come in.
It finally comes to a head when we are lying in bed at my house watching TV. She repositions facing me and grabs my hand while doing so and puts it on her breast. I really didn’t know how to feel about this. I really do like her but this was a bit fast of her. I was still vey dunk and I wasn’t 100% sure this was a go ahead, it could have been an accident (or some test?), even if it was a go for it I was still drunk and feeling sick. 
She kind of just stares at me and I end up kissing her on the forehead getting up and making us tea to try to kill my headache. She has tea and leaves, I feel sick for the rest of th week about the hole ordeal.

Life continues, and she graduates. We were going to go to grad together but we decided against it.
Now that she graduated life went on we still stay friends. However we sort of drifted away.
She was at university so I hardly ever saw her we would hang out maybe three times every two weeks at most. She got a date and they have been going out for several months. I met the guy he seems nice if a bit fruity.

I was with some other girls but nothing serious and I really did start to questions my feeling for her.
I decided to talk to her about them and we got into a big argument. I wasn’t sure about how I felt about her so allot of the argument was her asking “what do you mean” and me replying “I don’t know”.
 We got into more arguments later about my partying and her recent behavior with some of my friends, just the way she treated them. And how she was beginning to manipulate me and other people.

Eventually we saw each other in person and tried to patch things up but we somehow got into an argument.

The last words she said to me were “F*** you”
And the last words I said to you were “F*** you too”

Now three months later we saw each other just by accident in a public place, book store, we were both kind of ignored each other.

The next day I felt sick about not talking to her so I texted her ‘saw you yesterday how are you”
She replied and we hit it off. We spent a good two hours just texting filling each other in on our lives.
She’s still dating the fruity guy he’s still fruity. This carries on for two more days until I text her.
“Can we be friends again?”
She hasn’t responded.

I feel like I may have asked to soon or she’s just not interested or I don’ know.

When I ask my friends for advice they all say, you acting like a teenage girl which is bothersome.

What do I do just wait? Text her again? Try to see her? Or just kind of move along and forget her?

TL DR haven’t spoken to my best friend in months we start talking again and now we stopped again?
Should I text her? Should I move on? Should I just wait?
