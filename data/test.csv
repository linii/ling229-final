11430,Relationships,2ff0ft,"Ok, I am a newbie and this is my first post, please forgive me but will try to follow all the rules here.

Basically, we've been married 3 years, known each other 5. We had twins one year ago, and it has been a very difficult year for us -few friends/family in the area, transitioning to parenthood with twins at this stage has taken a big toll on our relationship, and we have serious arguments about almost everything it seems. We are really stuck on how to combine our finances and it's been a major fight between us lately.


I make about 100k and she makes around 60k, we live in an expensive city. When we got married I had about 20k in savings, and she had a lot more, that her family 'gave to her to hold on to' for her future. I was raised to not ask too much about money, and to respect people's privacy about money. I learned that she had this large sum only after we got married, was like, that's cool, and didn't think much of it. We were both doing well and money was not an issue. Her family apparently has a ton of money, and will freely give it to her when neeeded. I don't have any close family living.


When we got married, my wife, the math teacher, said we ought to combine our finances in some way, at least to cover our common expenses. I went along with it. She insisted it be a percentage of our weekly wages, so I had to put in more because I was earning more. Didn't know if this was fair exactly, but went along. In other words, if we had common expenses of 2000 a month, I might put in 1300 and she might put in 700, because I was earning more. 


About a year ago my last close family member died, and left me a house. Actually, he intended to leave me a house, but another family member got him to sign a new will on his deathbed giving everything to him, meaning me and the other family members lost it all and are in court fighting this. Chances are excellent I will win this house back, since there was coercion and trickery involved. However, I sank all my 20k into the legal fees and it could take another year or two if this goes to trial.


We had our twins about a year ago too, and at that time she wanted us to put 100% of our check into the joint account, because she said we are a family now. This didn't sit right with me, because I think people should have at least some of their own money, and shouldn't need to pull it out of some joint fund. For example, being stupid and a long night of drinking with friends, an impulse buy, buying new pair of shoes. I feel we should take that from our own money, not a joint account we both monitor. So we've fought and fought and I agreed to put in 90% of my check into the joint account. She puts in 90% too, but she makes much less than me. 


So now, we are this point where even the money in our joint account isn't covering the expenses with the kids. I can't figure out why, but she feels we should do best by the kids and buy what they need and not scrimp. Actually, we do pay about 4000 a month for a nanny to watch the twins, so that's probably our biggest expense. So our joint account is very low. Meanwhile, my own savings account has gone down to $1000 after all the legal fees, and just a little money going to my personal account every month. I'm at a point where I'll have to apparently borrow from her to pay my legal fees. This confuses me, because if I am putting in 90% of my check, or 90,000 a year, why do I need to borrow from her to pay a 2,000 lawyers bill that may come next month. It isn't adding up for me. 


Long story short, I am not happy with this arrangement of how we are dividing or combining our money. She doesn't want to put any of her large savings into the joint account, because it is just for our earnings not our personal savings. So I am at a point where I am about broke, I have no money to pull from the joint account I am putting money into, and she has a large sum of money in her private savings. 


I am wondering what people think of this, am I being wrong for being married with kids, and not wanting to combine all of our money into a joint account? Sometimes I wonder if I am being a jerk. On the other hand, people should have their own money, especially if they make much more than the other. And I have no money to use. Seriously, I will need to ask her for money out of her savings to pay my next lawyer bill or if I wanted to buy like a suit for work etc. 


I should add that we live in her family's apartment. We were paying rent, but when the kids were born they said we could stop for a time, so we haven't been paying rent. She doesn't mention it, but still.


It's been a stressful year of becoming new parents, and we are fighting over everything, but this is one thing we are fighting over very very badly. She feels its important and symbolic that I put my entire check into our joint account. I am wondering if even 90 is too much and I should reduce it. I don't have enough to cover my expenses. I am thinking of telling her to match what I put into the joint account, our of her savings that her family gave her, to be equal. 


it is a very emotional issue and it's really causing problems in our marraige. I am overheated and need help from others to think about this straight and logically. i know for some this is a first world kind of problem, but it is really a serious problem for my marraige. 

thanks

tldr: wife wants me to put all my check into a joint account after we had children. I make much more then her and have legal fees, and don't think its fair. She also has a lot of savings, but doesn't think that savings should go into the joint account. It's breaking us up. Help me find a fair solution!

11431,Relationships,23u49u,"I have been dating my boyfriend, Ryan*, for around 2 1/2 years. He is amazingly kind, sweet, caring, and supportive of me. He loves me so much and would do anything for me. Although we're young, we are both very mature in our relationship and have already gone through a number of bumps. In October of 2013, I started feeling really distant from him and I felt nothing for him for a few days. I decided to wait it out, treating it like a phase or a mood or something weird with me.

After a while, some of my feelings came back but things didn't feel the same as they had a few months ago. I know I still love him, but I have gotten so bored... we never do anything, we spend every weekend at home watching a movie. I realize I'm young and there are other people out there, and I'm scared I am going to cheat myself from having experience with other boys (Others have put this in my mind). We do fight from time to time, and things get nasty sometimes but other than that, we are pretty normal.

I have been trying for months to make sense of all this, but I just can't. Sometimes, I feel incredible with him, that I love him more than anything, and other times I feel mad and annoyed at him for really small things and also bored.I am torn... my heart and mind are confused. Please help!

11432,Relationships,1g04td,"i'm leaving in a week for the next two and a half months, and i won't have any way of contacting him with the exception of snail mail. no phones, wifi, etc. we usually don't spend a great amount of time together, unlike other couples of our ages. i see him maybe twice a week, and we've been dating for the past year. lately i've been wanting to spend more time together. when we do hang out, he talks about his friends and his plans with them. more importantly, he doesn't seem to want to hang out at all, though he says this is false.

11434,Relationships,2dycfk,"I have been dating a fantastic girl (35F) for the last 4 months. She was divorced a year and a half prior to us dating due to the ex-husband cheating (was married to him for about 9 years). She had dated other guys after the divorce but before me. She has 3 young kids. I (25M) have never married and do not have children. Prior to her, I would never have thought of dating someone divorced with kids or someone 10 years older than me.

The idea of being in a full-blown relationship scares her terribly. I have been very sensitive to this and tried not to push things too much. About two months ago, she stopped herself from telling me she loved me cause she thought I would have flipped, and it was a major thing for her to say. I only know because I asked her recently what she was going to tell me at that moment in time. I asked her if she meant it, whatever it was, she said yes. Asked her if it involved the L word, and she wouldn't confirm but she wasn't denying. It was an acknowledgement that it's what she feels but she's too scared to say it, which is perfectly fine and normal. 

We put the brakes on about a week ago to slow things down a bit. In that time, she has realized she has never healed from the divorce. She is scared of going forward at all as she has been getting attached and doesn't feel she can mentally let me in yet. She needs to heal some.  

I struggled tremendously over the past week with slowing things down, as we weren't talking very much at all. It was a major change. Last night we sat down to talk through things. She is okay with talking once a day via text, maybe seeing each other here or there. I realized last night that I had totally fallen for her, and that I love her. Of course, I cannot tell her this at all or it's bound to scare her further. 


I don't know what to do. I've got an incredible girl, who I am in love with. And she feels the same. I cannot tell her, otherwise I'll freak her out more probably. She needs to heal from the divorce. I'm not sure the best way to carry forward.  Part of me says I have to break it off and quit interacting with her entirely; the idea of this kills me. Another part wants to text a little bit each week, see her when she'll let me just in a very casual setting - hang out, watch a movie, nothing physical beyond cuddling, etc. Love her, want to be with her. Need to let her heal. What's the right way forward? How do I let her heal? She does not know. The idea of not talking/seeing each other a bit hurts her as well. 


And yes, I know this all seems crazy. Love in such a short time. But I have been in love before, and I know that what's here is genuine. Thank you in advance for your advice.

11436,Relationships,1ip3dg,"Long story short my girlfriend and I talked about having a threesome with a mutual friend (female) we discussed beforehand the boundaries and what we can and can't do. My only restriction was that whatever acts I performed on the other girl id also have to do on my girlfriend. Well last night we gave it a shot and it was pretty much the worst experience ive ever had. Not only was I not allowed to touch or do anything with the other girl but I was also cut out of the entire experience, I pretty much was forced by my girlfriend to just sit there and think only of her..she got pretty hot and heavy with the friend and they ended up taking it really far before I stopped them. I explained to my girlfriend in front of the friend our agreement and she got super mad and said I wasn't allowed to touch another girl and that she 'didnt remember agreeing to that' etc etc.

Now my male friends ive asked all argue that I was a pussy and should have just let them have sex, since I could of just watched but a huge part of me saw it as her cheating on me and me not being able to join in. Like she got a juicy steak and all I got to do is look through the window while she ate it.

The friend was very vocal about how she didn't mind and actually wanted me to join in, but my girlfriend started raving about me ruining the night and now shes giving me the silent treatment.



Some added info is that I have been 100% loyal to her through our entire relationship and she has cheated on me in the past with 2 guys which ive forgiven her for since it was early in the relationship. Im pretty sure unless someone in this thread changes my mind im going to end it with her. I think she's acting very selfish.

11437,Dating,2rcuq4,"So I started talking to this girl almost two months ago and we finally went on a couple dates the week before Christmas (one was lunch right before I left to go back to my family). She went back home as well and over this break texting was very scarce (she isn't much of a texter to begin with so it's not that alarming and this fact is relevant later).

I come back from break and she texts how was the flight, I respond, and she responds 30 minutes later, I ask if she wants to grab dinner, and she responds 45 minutes later she says she is super tired (6am flight that day) and can't keep her eyes open and that we should do it later that week (ok understandable). 

New years Eve comes around and we had a good time, after a few drinks we started getting super cute and fell asleep cuddling all night at my buddies place. The next morning she drove a friend home really early, but actually came back (the friend lives near her, much out of the way of where we were) and we went right back to cuddling. We finally get up and start some day drinking. Things eventually start to get cute (no cuddling, just smiling and playfulness). Later in the night she starts getting tired and falling asleep on the couch and I sit down to chit chat, however our friend kept waking her up. The girl is new in town and told me how much she just hates living by herself, so I offer to let her come over my place where we can watch a movie and she can pass out there (this wouldn't be the first time she was over with just me so it didn't seem that weird). She says that no, that's alright and that made me feel kind of weird (you are passing out every 30 minutes why not come back and sleep not alone, after we just cuddled the night before?) Eventually I get too tired and start to get emotional so I leave before I said something dumb. 

The next morning things got slightly confusing. She texts me around noon seeing if I'm up to anything fun this weekend (good sign). I say, no what about you? Did you still want to got to the game tomorrow? (we discussed this the day before). Then I followed up to see if she wanted to grab lunch since I just left work. 

She responds, not sure what I am doing this weekend but that I'm probably staying in tonight since I feel like shit, but if I'm feeling better I'd be down for the game

I say I'm sorry to hear that and reiterate she is always welcome over my place because I know how much living by yourself sucks.

She responds 4 hours later saying that she really appreciates the offer and she'll totally take me up on it, and sorry about the delayed response, she fell asleep.

Soooo...she texted me about the weekend, only to say she was too sick to do anything that weekend. Maybe it was a conversation starter, but there was no conversation that followed!

The next day I see how she is feeling. She responds an hour later saying still like shit, she has a bad head cold (believable since all of our friends have been sick recently) and she can't stop sleeping. I sent a response and she never responded.

I am just really confused because before christmas things seemed good, New Years went great, but we haven't seen each other just one on one in a few weeks. I know everyone is different, but I know for me even if I am tired/a little under the weather I would still want to see the person I really like after not seeing them for a few weeks or at least have a decent text convo without falling asleep. What is the interest level here from her? I can't tell if maybe she really likes me and is scared of something or what. Thing don't seem bad in anyway, but they also don't seem great either.

11439,Relationships,1ol851,"So my SO and I have been dating for nearly two years. He is a Merchant Mariner, and is therefore out at sea for many days at a time. He used to work for the Dept of Defense 4 months out to sea, 1 month home - which was really tough on our relationship. We ended up talking and he switched to a job where is out at sea 21 days, home for 21 days. I am currently unemployed, and I have been much of our relationship - because I was unaccustomed to dating someone who was always away, so I blew off work so I could see him as much as possible. I am now regretting this decision not to work, and am actively looking for employment, and have two interviews tomorrow (yay!) Anyway, the being gone for 21 days/home for 21 days is really tough on me, as I am a very clingy person, and I don't like time away from my SO. Soon he will be switching to a job that is 28 days away/28 days home. 

Now here's the problem: We have discussed having a family in the future. I have a medical condition (a bicornal uterus) which makes pregnancy high risk and dangerous. When we first started dating he told me he wouldn't sail forever, and would find a land job. Later he said he would find a landside job once we decided to have kids (in 5 years, as a compromise) Now he is saying that he loves sailing and doesnt want to quit, because I am not yet contributing. He wants to continue to be gone for 28 days or more/home for 28 days forever. I made it very clear that I cannot emotionally or physically deal with having a kid with someone who cannot be there half the year. I will be a high risk pregnancy - and I don't know how I can go through that by myself. I don't think I can handle raising a kid by myself half the year, or would want to. His argument is that he loves his job, and he won't give up a high paying job just to be home with me and a child. There are landside jobs he can do for just about the same amount of money. I will be working and plan to contribute as much as I can. Now he is saying this is a deal-breaker. He loves to sail and doesn't want to give up his standard of living ($$) I want to have a family and not go through a pregnancy and raising kids with him only there for half a year. We keep fighting about this, and we keep coming up with ultimatums...Any advice or relevant experiences, or opinions would be so helpful...

*******EDIT******** So we get into stupid fights sometimes. He just wants to make sure it doesn't infringe on our standard of living. We made up, and ended it off with this...

Me: so im gonna have a job and im going to contribute and work with you until we retire. and if we are financially able to afford it, will you go landside when the time comes, whenever that may be?

11440,Dating,1mv0l2,"Hi,

So this is more or less an update to a post I deleted. Wasn't sure about the flair.

So I dated this girl a few times, we ended up kissing but I had the impression she was looking for more and I finally manned up and cleared up some things.

I had a breakup not too long ago (well it's recent enough to be a problem that's what I mean) and it lead me to realise there's a lot of things I want to change in me, I'm insecure, I don't like my way of life, I think I have no ambition, I still have hang ups about my ex (no contact in 4-5 months, I do not hope for get back with her but I'm still sad about it and angry at her sometimes), I feel like I'm naive and lack experience in relatioships and I wouldn't mind having some fun. Basically a shit load of reasons that made me say I didn't want to be in a relationship with her (she only got the I'm just out of a relationship and want some fun. reason).

So we agreed it wouldn't work and stayed friends, we saw each other a few times, mostly with other people.

The thing is I like her a whole fucking lot. She's smart, funny, cute as fuck, we have very close interests, she has a fucking pokemon bra and is more geeky than me, etc... I'm not in love with her, no butterflies, no panicking heart when I see her, but I can't deny I like her.

I thought I could just be friends with her, until after a few drinks with common friends at a bar, a friend of mine told me he'd wanted to kiss her but realized there might be something between us and decided not to. (That's a fucking good friend too.) And that made me a bit jealous.

Plus all the people I told this about were all: Stop fucking around and overanalyzing and try anyway..

So I'm wondering why not try anyway? And how? I'm thinking I should maybe explain the situation honestly: I may not be in the best state to be in a relationship but I'd hate myself for not trying because you're rad as fuck. But I don't know exactly.

Plus I think I just made her mad somehow and that's not helping.

&gt; **TL;DR
&gt; After saying no to a relationship with a great girl I like because of issues I want to deal with (insecurity, things I don't like about myself, etc...) I'm having second thoughts.

11443,Infidelity,2bgess,"Sorry for any incoherencies. I'm sleep deprived and heartbroken.


Two nights ago, my fiance (we've been engaged 1 month, together 2 years, had an arrangement for 2 years prior to that) ruined my life. Our relationship started in a strange way, so I guess I'll explain from the beginning.


During O week of my first year in undergrad, I met a guy while shopping with friends. He approached me, was so very handsome and charming, so I gave him my number...mostly because I was showing off to my friends. I didn't really have any interest in dating anyone, let alone an obviously older man.


So we text/talk for a couple weeks before he proposes an arrangement in which I accompany him to business events that he has to go to sometimes in exchange for free vacations/pretty dresses. I eventually say yes, and he flies me out a month later to Hawaii for a weekend. I had my own room, he didn't ask for sex, and I didn't offer. I'd had fun, so when he invited me to Vegas two months later, I said yes. We carried on this way for about 6 months and 5 trips before I initiated a physical relationship. I didn't feel obligated to, I just wanted to. I was developing real feelings for him. 


About 18 months into our arrangement (we started seeing each other more often than just during the monthly trips), I had a falling out with my roommate, and he offered to let me stay in his condo (he has a condo downtown and a house in the suburbs) until I found something else. It was basically my place because he preferred staying in the suburbs for the quiet. Around this time, we discussed being together officially as a couple, and we both stopped seeing other people.


I ended up staying at his condo for the rest of my college career (~2 1/2 years). He proposed at my graduation party last month. He'd been resisting setting a date with me, even though I'd been asking him almost every day about it. I wanted to start planning. We had a huge argument about his hesitation, and we didn't speak for a couple days.


Two nights ago, he came over and told me that he's still married and still lives with his wife (whom he'd told me was an ex-wife). He said he was ready to leave her for me, but divorce takes time, so he couldn't make any wedding plans with me yet. I cried and tried to reconcile what he was telling me and what he'd been telling me for the past 4 years. Eventually, I got angry and left with a few of my things.


I haven't spoken to him since. I'm staying with my parents, but they don't know what's going on yet. No one does because I fear they'll all just say, I told you so. My entire life revolved around him. I turned down my 1st choice grad program to go to a school in the area to stay close to him. I lost friends and almost pushed my family away for him because they weren't happy about the age difference. I'm also late and am terrified that I might be pregnant. I'd purchased a couple tests to take with him, but now I can't bring myself to use one.


I love him and want to just ignore what he told me. He proposed, after all. That means he really was going to leave. But our entire relationship was a lie.


He would always complain about his ex-wife, and how awful she was...I guess it was his way of venting about his wife without having to come clean that they were still married. It makes sense now that he always went home to the suburbs, even though he works downtown... He was always there when I called though. Never once did he ignore me, disappear randomly, or not come to me when I wanted him. How is this even possible??


I guess I'm just looking for perspective, and for people to help strengthen my resolve to leave this guy. I know it's right, but I want so badly to stay with him.



---   
**tl;dr**: Recently engaged to my BF/SD of 4 years, confessed he's married after being pressured about setting a wedding date. He says he wants to leave her for me. I'm considering staying, even though I know I shouldn't. Any input is appreciated.

**Update:** I'm pregnant. My sister is going to help me clear out my stuff from his condo while he's at work today. I finally turned on my phone and read/listened to all his messages. I want to see him to get some answers from him as well as tell him I'm pregnant. Right now, I don't want to be with him. 

I'm not sure how to get in touch with his wife. Any suggestions? He doesn't have a facebook (or maybe he does, I'm not sure of anything anymore). I'm not going to his house. What if she's not home?

I've started conversations with him on facebook twice since I've liked him. But they always seems to go like:

Me: Hey :)

Him: Hey :)

Me: How're you?

Him: Pretty good how about you?

Me: That's good, I'm good

Him: What's doing?

And then we might talk a little bit about what we're doing, but then it seems to peter out. I know we have some common interests, but the conversation never seems to get that far. I can't ask him about homework or school stuff because we're not in the same year at school.

Also, how many times do I start conversations with him? Because I don't want to be that annoying girl who always messages him. I mean, it's not like he ignores me (he tends to reply pretty quickly) but he could just be being nice.

TL;DR: I like a guy, sometimes I talk to him on facebook, want to know how to swing conversations around to our common interests.",How do I [17F] talk to my crush [16M] (who I've known forever but have rarely spoken to) on Facebook and how many times should I start conversations before giving up?,0.0,False,1.0,1.0,1370747020.0,/r/relationships/comments/1fynhs/how_do_i_17f_talk_to_my_crush_16m_who_ive_known/,Romantic
11445,Relationships,3hszn3,"My boyfriend I have been together for two years- two really wonderful years. When we first met I wasn't looking to date, but he slowly wooed me, and I really fell hard for his wonderful personality. Background on him: he is witty, smart, funny, makes me feel loved, cared for, and beautiful, and I love spending my time with him. He's a wonderful person, and I can't emphasize enough that I really do love him deeply. He is also objectively pretty attractive... I'd say a solid 7!


However. I am just not attracted to him. I can't honestly say that I was ever knocked to the ground by those tidal waves of attraction you feel for some people just by looking at them, but his personality is so compelling that (especially in the beginning) I wanted to have sex with him, make him feel good, and have a good time, if that makes any sense. Also, the sex itself is great! We seem to have a good fit, and our bodies work great together. The sex itself isn't the problem. It's the *getting to sex* part that needs work. 


To clarify- I could make out with him all night long, and just not feel aroused. Fingering is getting tougher and tougher because I'm just not getting wet. When he gets naked, I literally never have an ooh la la! moment. Even when we start pawing at each other before sex, even if I was horny before we started, the pawing won't do anything for me. Also, I'm just not in the mood that much any more... it's been in a steady decline since we started dating.  All of this is a marked change from past relationships of mine that may not have been emotionally fulfilling, but which were sexually captivating. 


To try to rectify this I've coached him in things I like and dislike when he does, but it honestly feels like it hasn't made an impact- the fault really isn't him, but mine. He does pretty much exactly what's been done to me before and works- I'm just not attracted to *him* very much. And my only solution is to reach for the lube and get to the sex part.


I really want to be aroused by this guy- he even might be the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. However, it is getting bad enough as the novelty has worn off of our relationship that I'm considering calling it quits. Anyone have any advice or personal experience I can rely on?

11449,Dating,3bjn0g,"I met this guy around 8 months ago. I had a boyfriend back then but the guy still subtly flirted with me. My relationship with my boyfriend was rocky and when I broke up with my boyfriend, the guy came on to me stronger and I thought 'why not' since I was newly single and went on a date with him.


We've been seeing and talking to each other for over 2 months now. I really enjoy spending time with him and started having feelings for him. We both have very demanding jobs, working mostly 12-13 hours a day so I can't and don't expect to see him often. So we've been seeing each other once 1-2 weeks - which I am totally okay with as this works out with my schedule and all my previous relationships were like this. 


I stayed over at his place the last time I saw him and we hooked up. Sex was great and the morning sex was even better. He treated me well, driving me home and texting me afterwards. But since then, I haven't seen him, which was almost a month ago!


Now, the guy was out of town for 2 weeks but I still feel like he could've tried to make time to see me? He continued to text me 2-3 times a week during the month, updating me on what he's up to and asking me about my day &amp; week. He has never ignored any of my texts and unless he's busy at work, he responds within 20-30 minutes, sometimes within a minute. We also break the dating text rules 101' by texting each other up to 100 messages on some days.


So this is the part I'm confused about. He came back in town last weekend and texted me apologizing for not being around, listing what he has to do that weekend and how he'll make it up to me. Note: I didn't ask him what he was doing that weekend and didn't even expect to see him anyways. I kind of gave him cold shoulder because I felt like he was giving me excuses and I'm being strung along? I don't want to be interested in a guy who is not interested in me and would like to walk away before I invest too much of my emotions and time.

11455,Relationships,2cdm0d,"Hi all. I've never done anything like this before but I'm having a day so bad I can't find the words to describe it. I just need to talk to someone, vent and hopefully calm myself down. Maybe in the process some folk can give me a sense of perspective also. So here goes.

A precursor about me - I'm an emotional type guy who has had a rocky relationship with my mother growing up (alcoholism, parents splitting up, yadda yadda). So I think from this, I have trust issues and low confidence.

I have been with my girlfriend since January. Things got off to a rocky start. I noticed from the outset she was immensely confident, charismatic, sexy, funny and flirtatious which drew me in but I would quite often be the victim of lying and manipulation. So many things with her and her activities just wouldn't 'add up', you know?

First of all, cutting a huuuuge long story short, she dabbled in prostitution. Both before she got with me, and right at the beginning of our relationship, twice, that I know of. I managed to brush this under the carpet and we moved on. Then there were all the lies to cover this up, which as you can imagine were *massive* lies and hard to swallow.

Secondly, she was hugely reticent to publicly commit to being in a relationship with me. Ya know, to everyone else we were just friends. No changing any online status, that sort of thing. I feel this was because she got a lot of male attention and she didn't want to give this up.

Oh and right at the beginning, she was speaking to a random guy inappropriately online, and one of her close friends dropped her in it by showing me a message. Again, lots of lying to cover this up on her part, and then we put it behind us.

As the months went by, to be honest things mostly got better, but with the odd lie here and raging argument there. From my point of view there would be a lot of very violent mood swings on her part, as well as the irrationality during arguments the likes of which I'd never seen ever before.

Can anyone see anything here? Yep, we managed to diagnose her with what we think is BPD. She's been to a therapist who tends to agree with us. I understand this must be really difficult living with from her perspective, but from mine it is also difficult.

Things have come to a huge head last night.

She has been wanting to go to a show with cars and live music which involves camping over night. Except she hasn't really told me she **really** wants to go. It's been stuff like I don't know if I can be bothered really, I don't know yet etc. Since she's indicated it, I've merely responded by saying I don't know if I can trust you to do that - it will be very hard for me, after everything, etc.

This caused a cataclysmic argument. Like, next level manipulation and irrationality and rage. It's this that pushes me over the edge, and me not being perfect, I say things I soon regret sometimes. In the heat of the moment last night on the phone, she put the scenario to me of do you actually want to be with me? So me feeling manipulated and lied to, and trying to maintain my dignity and not feel like a pushover of a man, I essentially broke up with her and abandoned her. Not a good idea I know to do to a BPD girl, which then sees me getting threatened with suicide repeatedly.

This upset her and she was initially really apologetic and begged for me back, and said she understood how it is difficult for me etc. This continued a bit today after we slept on it, but she soon went back to what I class as the 'crazy' side of BPD - irrational, manipulating and next-level rage.

Fast forward a bit today and she goes off the radar for a few hours, saying she was at home talking things over with her mum. But I was dead worried as she wasn't picking up or responding to messages - quite a worry when someone threatens suicide all the time. So I said I was going to do the 3 hour drive to her house to check up on her. Immediately she replies saying she was fine, and at home, with some inconsistent story about being busy. This didn't add up - I spoke to a mutual friend of ours and he sounded like he was covering for her to go to this show, not giving me a clear answer.

Next thing, within minutes (but it is about an hour from her house) the mutual friend confirms she arrives at the show. Finally she calls me, but lays into me. I'd essentially been lied to all day, and last thing I knew she was a BPD girl with issues to sort, but now everything has changed. I'm controlling with issues and I stop her doing things, etc etc you name it.

This put me in a really, really bad place. It was really surreal, like a dream or nightmare. I don't know if anyone reading this has been lied to by several people at once in the middle of a break up, but it isn't pleasant. Suddenly I started questioning everything - like, am I crazy? Is this a dream? I pinched myself. I freaked out, broke down and cried like a girl(!!!) Why is this happening? What happened to the girlfriend who was in love with me? Why am I now the biggest piece of shit spread on toast that's ever lived? How can she not *see* how upset the lying had made me? And now she has the *audacity* to be speaking to me like this?

So yeah, I think I need to wrap it up. I understand I can appear controlling, but this is my trust issues coupled with the lies and rocky start of the relationship manifesting themselves. I'm not perfect. I get that. I just wanted to vent, and if someone can offer their perspective, that would be great.

I haven't really spoke to her much since. She's now at this show having a good time with friends, when I don't entirely trust her. But I'll have to. And I am of course the biggest shithead going. Yes, I wasn't very compromising about it, but I don't think I deserved to be lied to all day when she was planning to go to this thing all along. Like I tell her regularly - it's not the action that's bad necessarily (I don't really have an issue with her going to an event if she had been honest about it from the outset); instead it's the lying about it and the irrationality in the discussions and arguments about it.

Thank you for reading. If I have not made sense or missed anything I will be glad to elaborate in the comments.

11456,Relationships,2w7rsv,"Hullo Reddit,  newbie on mobile here,  please excuse my noobness. 

Like all these,  it's complicated (yawn, I know,  but please read on!), my girlfriend and I have been together just over two years, after a long time having a crush (mutual) and fooling around (sleeping together after house partys).

In that time before dating, we had our ups and downs as I got over my ex (suicidal, crazy, scared me out of a sex life for a couple of years). In this time,  she had a few guys,  but she couldn't move on. About months later we got talking properly again and duscussed the possibility of a relationship, which was positive. This lead to me asking her out at the top of her parents farm with a spectacular view. 

However,  from the start is seemed a bit of that romantic spark was gone,  it was just normal when we headed off to bed, not exciting. Don't get me wrong,  I care deeply for her and always have, but sometimes we feel more like friends than bf/gf. 

Lately we've been drifting apart, it feels like we've stayed together as we know it's safe, rather than due to love. When this topic comes up she gets emotional, I fully believe her when she says she loves me, but I can't honestly say the same.

What's stemmed some problems is that now I've graduated university,  we don't have so much in common.  I'm pursuing my interest in MTB,  multisport and hunting,  she's a little overweight and unwilling to try any of this. Her only hobby is her horse,  which I have tried to learn to ride,  we got on ok,  but it's not really my kinda thing. 

I'm unsure what to do, I know I'd struggle to let her go, but I don't see us being together for the rest of our lives, but she's such a big part of mine right now. Her family love me (siblings: 18m,12f,11m), and her parents and her grandparents, all invite me into their family. Also most of my friends are from those house parties, and are mostly her friends from school etc, as being from 550km away,  I didn't know anyone when I came to town and ended up attending a party hosted by a guy I met at university. 

So, I don't know what to do,  I want to try fix our relationship, but I've tried to talk to her about doing this,  which lead to nothing in our relationship changing. What do I do Reddit? Keep trying to fix it, or end it? Either way,  how do I do it?

Fiance has friend who when we met he told me up front about her and their past and whatnot. He wanted to make sure I knew everything about his past so I didnt run away like every other girl when they found out later. Thats fine, I was young didnt know better whatever, appreciated the honesty (mostly). Mistake he made was telling me he wished he had slept with her because he never did, she just used to stay at his place and sleep nude and he would go watch her strip regularly but apparently wasn't interested in sleeping with him. They did this on and off for years til she started sleeping with his best friend and then it was just friendly encounters. Ok wasn't real fond of her from the get go I admit that but she wasnt exactly real nice to me either so there was tension.

THEN I go out of town 1.5 years into the relationship. He takes her out, which he would never do while I was in town, wont answer his phone all night, and promises me he didn't do anything with her and that she never even came over when I get ahold of him the next day. I was still upset he took her out while I was out of town and wouldnt answer his phone and he apparently told her I was upset. She then contacted me and told me nothing happened she just stayed over most the night hanging out in the living room and then went home. So I knew he lied to me about her, we almost broke up, he had to work really really hard at gaining trust back and I dont fully believe they never did anything. I forgave him eventually and we moved past it.

Then she needs a job. He gets her a job where he works to help a friend out. I am not ok with this after his past behavior with her but he insists and tries to get us to become friends. I try, we hang out, I invite her to his birthday party and whatnot. We go to dinner with her and invite her over and things are mostly fine.

She moves away eventually and leaves him high and dry on that job he stuck his neck out for her and I am pretty happy about her moving and pissed she treated him so poorly. Dont think about her much after a while until he starts telling her publicly online how hot she is and how sexy she is (wtf?). What an embarrassment to me, we fight and almost break up again over her. I forgive him, he stops doing that. Then he accidentally pulls up pictures on his phone and her in a bikini is the first picture in that album and the picture was only posted on the internet days before that. Obviously I am pissed off especially after he admits to using them for his “needs”. I dont care about random people but his friend, who has already almost broken us up and come in between us, he has to use HER pictures? That was 2-3 years ago but I cant say I ever fully forgave that after everything else he did. 

Since then hes mostly cut her out of his life and stopped trying to get us to visit her when we go to the city she lives in to visit other people. They talk occasionally when she needs something (like computer help or whatnot) but that is it. We've had a pretty good relationship last few years without her living in town and him maturing enough to not do shitty things like that. We get engaged, life is good.

Well wedding is in a month. She contacts the best man yesterday and asks to go with him even though we did not invite her. Best man doesnt know (we kept drama between us, didnt spout it for everyone to know) and thinks she was invited and agrees to drive her here a few days early even to hang out with him and my fiance. I tell him flat out she is not welcome at our wedding and he is fine with that, understands, is very supportive. I even offer to tell her myself to avoid him having to be mean to her. I honestly dont want hurt feelings if we can help it even if she was really out of line doing that. He insists on doing it and just tells her simply that we are completely booked and everything is final with less than a month to go we cant add anymore people and that the best man didnt know. She knows he is lying and freaks out at us both and no longer wants anything to do with being his friend. Now he is upset about loosing a friend because of me. He is irritated and now I am too. I just cant believe she is causing problems again and now so close to our wedding. Who invites themselves to a wedding anyway by asking another guest to take them?

What can I do? How can I move past this crazy girl who my fiance clearly had some sort of attachment to? I thought things were fine and he was over it and everything and I want to just be happy and not think about all this horrible painful past stuff with her. I dont want him bitter with me about loosing her when its his behavior with her and her liking to cause drama that caused this. 

Am I in the wrong here? Did I overreact to her wanting to come to the wedding? I know his behavior in the past is atrocious but he isn't that person anymore, I wouldnt be marrying him if he hadn't grown up since then and started treating me with respect so maybe I am punishing him wrongly by telling her she cant come and causing her to not be his friend anymore?

**TL;DR Fiance has always had a thing for his friend, told me so when we met. Lied to me about her staying over once, got her a job with him, started telling her how attractive she was in public, and then accidentally showed me bikini pictures of her and admitted to using them for his personal time. That was 2-3 years ago and he since stopped and everything has been fine for years. Yesterday she invited herself to our wedding by going to the best man and he agreed to bring her without knowing she wasnt invited or welcome. Fiance tells her she cant come after I make it clear I dont want her there, she freaks out and no longer wants to be his friend, he is upset with me for causing him to lose a friend. Not sure if Im in the wrong or not.**

A preface: I dated this girl for 3 years.  We broke up about 5-6 months ago because she felt like she had to focus on other things in her life and that she could no longer try in our relationship.  I loved her.  She's been the most amazing person in my life, even up to this day.  I'm not going to lie- it hurt a lot but I understood and respected her decision.


Last week we met back up and it felt like our relationship had never ended?  That connection between us was undeniably back.  She had actually been asked out by another guy and was going to respond to him the next day but because we happened again, she told him no.  I hadn't talked to her for weeks prior and I had no knowledge of the other guy... I don't believe what happened that day last week was a coincidence.  I know a lot of people will say it's stupid to go back down that road, but its something that I'm willing to do.  We talked about it today and we both admitted that the feelings were back, but she also decided that she doesn't want to get close to a guy again, partially given that she had just rejected the other guy who was her friend and partially because it was me.


I didn't pry or beg for her back.  But I did ask her to be open to the possibility of us again because we both know how great we are together  and we both still had undeniable feelings for each other.  However, she's pretty determined to resist getting close to me again.  I'm not sure if I should even actively pursue this.  I want to let things happen again, naturally... but her determination to keep her feelings in check also puts distance in between us.  


Any advice on how to approach this?  I do want her back.  But she's strong willed and I know she's able to keep her feelings in check.  How do I get her to fall for me again?  ((  I'm a huge fan of cheesy romantic gestures (like serenading her with a guitar and candles in the park) and I've used it to win girls before but I feel like thats not the right thing to do this time ))

Anyway, in our six month relationship I became friends with her cousin(J) and her boyfriend(S) and other people. 
Well since our seperation the three of us have went out and had fun. A couple of time even with another cousin and her friends. We just go out and have a great time. We've only hung out a handful of times and have a good time. When we do hang out we don't bring up my ex or even talk about the situation. They understand that I have a no contact situation with my ex. 
The real problem comes from when/if pics are posted on facebook. Apparently, other family members ask my ex why these people are hanging out with me. I believe it is her mother or a different cousin that are mentioning these events to her.
I do have my own circle of friends that I normally hang out with. I have my own life. I am trying to move on. But I will not rush into another relationship to try and move on.

To let you know, my girlfriend is currently abroad for studying and has been so for roughly a year, and we have 2 more to come.

I regularly visit her. Around twice every month if I have the time for it, but due to a lot of work, and various problems in my daily life, the next time I'll go there isn't before new years eve.

lately thoughshe haven't been responding to my texts, or my calls(only talked together for roughly 30 minutes the past 8 days)

And due to that I have really been missing her really much. I constantly think of her, about how much I want to be with her, what we could do when we are together, and pretty much just how much I love her. However at the same time I have been making a lot more mistakes at work, because I can't think about how to solve simple problems.

After roughly a week filled with mistake after mistake, my boss told me that if I didn't step up soon and did something good, my contract wouldn't be renewed, and at the end of the day he told me not to turn in tomorrow so I could stay home and cool my head and then come ready for work on Monday.

I am not interested in breaking up with her, because I really love her. But how can I stop thinking about her all the time? Any advice would be helpful.

He suffers from severe depression and anxiety; he takes medication, but some days are better than others.

I come from a family that doesn't really talk about emotions or anything really while his family is really open about their emotions. So I've definitely had to work at communication and initiation of affection (both verbal and physical). I've been trying pretty hard to change and get better at this. 

He told me that he sometimes feels like I don't love or care about him as much as he loves me. Basically because I don't tell him as much as he thinks I should or if I do it's because he's prompted it. For the record, I'm not silent about my feelings. I tell him I love him all the time, I do things like make handmade cards, I'm super cuddly (although not as much as him) and I'm a good listener/supporter (he's told me this). BUT I don't initiate sex often (something I'm working on) and I don't often talk about how I feel about him (unless he asks). 

It hurts because I feel like I'm doing everything I can to get better at communication and initiation of sex/affection. I also wonder if his standards are too high. I feel like if he doesn't get the exact kind of affection he's looking for without having to ask for it than he's unhappy. Maybe he should relax his standards knowing that everyone communicates differently. But maybe I'm just getting defensive.

11463,Infidelity,2uz42c,"So about two years ago, I started an extremely high-stress job in the field of my particular chosen profession.

Okay fuck it, I'm a nurse and started in an insanely busy emergency room for my first ever baby nurse job.  I'm sure many can relate, if not, imagine getting thrown into a pit of two hundred snakes and being told that you have to (a) guess which snakes are actually sick, (b) keep all the snakes alive, and (c) make sure all the snakes are happy, even while paying special attention to the possibly dying snakes.

I guess referring to my patients as snakes doesn't reflect well on me. Er, strike that, let's call them puppies.  It's not like I'm going to come out looking too great in this post anyway.

So I start in the ED and meet a lot of amazing and not-so-amazing people.   One of the people I met was my coworker, let's call him Mark.  

Mark is all-around fantastic, and we bonded almost immediately.  I had been hired less than a few months after the worst breakup of my life, but being an open book and raconteur I told almost anyone about it.  Others feigned awkward sympathy, but Mark was different.  We laughed together when I told someone new about my misadventures.  But most of all, he was always there with an encouraging word or a helping hand when I wanted to give up.  He's funny, empathetic, and blah blah fill in all the other things we think about people with whom we're infatuated.  He's my rock at work, and for a long time I thought the glowing feeling I got when he walked in was simple relief.  

Well at some point, I gained my footing so-to-speak, and the work environment clicked.  I no longer necessarily needed all that help from Mark, but I still had the same sunny feeling when I saw him, like the day had gone from certain drudgery to any bright possibility. 
     

Uh-oh, looks like someone had a crush.  And unfortunately it wasn't just his adorable gap-toothed grin or that muscle under his scrubs, I actually cared about this guy.  So I did the obvious logical thing: I joined OkCupid and got myself a boyfriend, one who was the opposite of Mark in almost every way.  Tall where Mark was short, lanky and soft where Mark was a compact bruiser, fair and pompous and artistic where Mark was a no-nonsense ex-warrior.

Mark hated him, and made no bones about it.  Eventually the relationship ended, and Mark took me to breakfast, told me the guy was an ass anyway, gave me a long hug and told me to stop dating such assholes.  

Cut to nearly a year later, and the flirtation has gotten out of hand.  Had I mentioned Mark was a notorious flirt?  No one thought much about it, least of all me.  But we had started playing a kind of chicken with each other, touches getting more daring, hugs getting longer...we'd find ourselves in a room alone together and try to outdo the other one with shutting the doors, turning the lights off, etc.  

Well, now's the part of the story where I confess: I consider myself kind of slutty.  I'm sure there's some weird female misogyny mixed with self-hatred in there, but there you have it.  There was of course part of me that didn't care about anything else, I just wanted this guy.  I warned him on one memorable occasion, You'd better be careful, I can only get teased so long.

And yet I held out, because SPOILER ALERT, this guy is married.  I'd love to tell you I've never had any romantic attachments to married men before, but remember how I said I'm apparently kind of slutty?  But this one...I don't know how to explain it.  I really do care about him.  So I kept that paper-thin barrier intact.

Even a couple months ago, in the most romantic possible situation, I held back. We were at a friend's wedding, and we were both dressed up, rather than in oversized scrubs covered with various bodily fluids.  He looked...oh damn.  And the look he gave me when he saw me in heels and a dress, double hot damn.  

He saved the last dance for me, whirled me out onto the floor like fucking Cinderella, and I somehow through the haze of too much wine remembered we were around everyone we worked with and whirled myself away again.  

Well the wine caught up, as it's wont to do, and shortly after the gorgeous bride and her loving husband left the venue, I ran out into the lit-up town and found myself a percussion group performing batucadas and Christmas carols.  Being an ex-fine arts major myself (particularly, a percussionist), and being as joyful and expansive as one can only be with too much champagne, I joined in.  
Maybe two songs in, Mark caught up to me.  I turned around and there he was, and to this day I don't know how I didn't kiss him right there and then.  Probably because he seemed more serious than I'd ever seen him, distressed and frowning. He drove me home and the whole time, I babbled about bell patterns and 3/2 versus 2/3 clave just so I wouldn't say something stupid.  Like how much I luh-luh-liked him.  

So I put all that in the back of my head for a couple months, and things progressed much as usual.  Too-long touches, strange silent bonding moments when a patient passes, rowdy mornings at the local watering hole after work.  Just a flirtation.

I guess things all came to a head the other night.  I had a patient brought in by rescue who was almost immediately Baker Acted (involuntary commission for mental health evaluation--basically this woman said she wanted to kill herself which meant a staff member needed to sit with her at all times).  I asked Mark to sit with her while I did work on some of my other patients, and he of course did.  A little while later, I went back into the room to draw blood and do some other things with her while Mark took a break.  

As he was leaving, this woman says to me, OOOOOOH girl, he is CUTE!  That smile...and THAT ASS, oh Jesus~!  I laughed and unguardedly said, Trust me, I know.  She proceeded to ask me why I hadn't, and I quote, jumped on that, and I remembered myself and tried to be professional.  

Mark then walked back in, and she continued, Boy, what are you doing?  Isn't this girl pretty?  Look how pretty she is!  

This girl? he replied, I've had a crush on her for years.  

Then why haven't you done nothing?  She don't like you?

I unfortunately met his eyes at this point, and said without looking away, Oh, that's certainly not the problem.

Then what are you two doing in here with me?  

I pointed out his wedding ring, and she freaked out on him, saying he shouldn't be looking at me like that then.  
Later on we joked about it, and that morning we ended up at the same old bar after work with a few other people. 

We had talked a bit earlier about my days as a percussionist, and he let it slip that he remembered some of the things I had been babbling about that night after our friend's wedding.  I cocked an eyebrow and made some quip about him hanging on my every word, and he looked away, smiling and scrolling through his phone.

After a few moments, he handed the phone to me, and said Well, it's tough not to remember.  There I was on the screen, face alight, swaying back and forth with agogo bells in hand, trying to follow along with the Spanish lyrics to another Christmas carol.  He had been watching me that night long before he walked up beside me.  I looked back up at him, the rest of our group lost in chatter, and he smiled, not the huge gap-toothed grin that I love, but a small private smile.  Another dare.  

For all the details I remember about little meaningless encounters, I wish I could remember how I ended up in the hallway outside the bathroom with him, or how I ended up kissing him.  But it's still all a blur to me.  I do know I initiated it, and that he responded enthusiastically.  But then we were interrupted by someone walking up (no one we knew, fortunately), and broke apart.  I went into the bathroom, splashed some water on my face, and walked back to our table.  

Finally when everyone started to leave, Mark excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I did the same.  I waited for him outside in that same hallway and apologized profusely, he told me not to worry about it and kissed me on the forehead.  

I know it was meant to be a chaste, platonic gesture, but without leaving each others' arms we ended up eye to eye again, and with the look in his eyes I was just finished.  I grabbed him by the collar, he fisted his hands in the sides of my shirt, and the next thing I knew I was pressed up against the wall, both of our hands in very new territory.  I'm not sure how long we made out, but we both tried to end it several times before finally Mark backed away and said, I can't, I can't.  I'm sorry.  
We said our goodbyes, hugged, and left.  At work the next night things were slightly awkward to start but returned much to their usual pace.  

In the parking garage before we went home, he pulled me in for a close hug and kissed me goodbye.  I left in a daze...I thought the previous day's transgression was going to just be left in the past.  

A day later (yesterday), I was off work, and checking Facebook when I noticed something off about some posts on my wall...Mark had deleted me.  Today, he changed his profile picture to one of him and his wife.  

Let me be clear...I think I love this guy, but it's for that exact reason I want to fix this situation.  I would never try to wreck his home life, though I know I've already taken steps in that direction.  I was hoping neither of us would ever tell anyone about this, and life could just move on, but I'm fearing the worst now.  And I don't have any way to contact him that won't look like the crazy possessive homewrecker is trying to stake her claim.  

The part that I was taking as some cold comfort in all this was that Mark's wife has cheated.  I was there as the shoulder to cry on when it happened.  But he forgave and forgot as far as I know, so I had been hoping that he wouldn't feel as guilty to have done such a small thing to someone who had done worse to him and gotten away with it.    

I thought maybe this would blow over as just some awkward thing that happened, but if it hasn't, I want him to know that I'll gladly find a new job or cut off all contact.  I don't know what's going on, and it's killing me.  I work with him again Sunday, and I don't know how to tell him that I'm no threat to his marriage, I'm no one, I'm just a stupid girl with a stupid crush.  I don't want to affect his life like this.  

What do I do?  I know that kissing him was wrong, no matter what I feel for him, but there's nothing I can do to undo that now.  Should I start applying for jobs elsewhere?  Should I assure him that I have no delusions about what all of this means next to a marriage?  Or do I just ignore him and disappear, taking my rightful place as no one, a set piece in the play of their dysfunctional marriage?

I'm a horrible excuse for a homewrecker, as it seems I'm mostly the one in a wreck.  Can I salvage this friendship?  More importantly, how do I make sure things are okay for him while staying arms-length from him?

11464,Relationships,1syr2e,"Hi Reddit,

Where to begin... I guess at the beginning. Both of us were after bad relationships, both of us had really good chemistry, passion, fun, laughs. Falling in love, for real. And it was in a good pace, nothing fancy, no stars, or heads spinning, or other Hollywood c*ap.

Plain ol' love, burning slowly but truthfully.

Nothing happened, I guess: maybe it was Life. Both of us are sooo busy, having more obligations than just a 9-to-5 job, so gradually passion and attraction died out. Not altogether, but too much to bear (eg. sex frequency is dissatisfying).

I adore her wisdom, smarts, looks, values, philosophy. We get along very, very well and we love each other to the extent of talking about moving in together at some point in the seen future and even having a family together in the unforeseen future. We both know and agree we're not there but it feels like there's a potential.

Problem -- and there is always one, right? -- is that I am not as attracted to her as before. Not sure what exactly; weight maybe? She did not gain weight. Maybe it's the routine? possibly. Most likely the feel that it's not that exciting as it used to be.

So what do we do about it? We work on it!
Vacations, weekends off, date nights when possible. And to be honest, it helps. Sometime in the next month we're going away for a long while (approx. 2 weeks) and it should be amazing.

I really want to be optimistic about Us, since I care for her dearly, still love her and I know she loves me too. This small doubt never lets go, though. Maybe 'cause the sex is okay but not great, mainly in comparison to previous partners that I had.

To sum up my questions (and there's plenty, sorry for that!).

1) Sex is an issue.

From your experience, does the sex get better? Even if our libidos are not the same? We end up touching each other more often than having penetration...

Whenever she tries to be adventurous in bed / discuss such things I shy away, I guess mainly because I am afraid to be up front about my declining attraction to her.

[Confession, not sure if it's related: that's the first time in my life, after numerous partners, that I feel my penis is not large enough when I am inside her (sorry for TMI). I guess it affects us both, dynamic in bed that is.]


2) Can intimacy create passion?

That's my angle. We are, consciously working on being more intimate, both physically, emotionally and mentally. I hope it'll increase attraction... but not sure about it.

I am attracted to her emotionally, intellectually too, beyond any measure. Did any of you had experience with such emotions creating attraction?

3) How on earth can I talk with her about *any* of this?

Thanks all,
- Vinnie

I'm completely and utterly crushed and lost in the world. 


My boyfriend of a year and a half just, completely out of the blue, ended our relationship. I'm so confused.


We first met through a mutual friend and hung out as very good friends about 3-4 months before we decided to even think about becoming more. The first time we hung out together, just him and I, i felt something I have never felt before with another human being. I truely, and still do and will probably always will, that he was the one, that I was going to spend the rest of my physical life with him. It was like our souls were connect. He felt the same way. We were inseperable from there on.


In the beginning, everything was perfect. The only downsides were that we were both living at our parent's. We both had jobs and both of us didn't make a lot between us. But, we didn't give a fuck about that, money has never ever been an issue for me, he also believed money was never a factor in someone. Everything was perfect. We were so in love, in that gross, cheesy honeymoon stage. He went on family vacations with me, we did family things together. His family adores and loves me. My family loves him. He helped me through my first grandparent's death. Our friends are mutual and always said out loud we were perfect for each other. I could hang out with the boys (since I grew up being a tomboy and being one of the boys so that wasn't new) and joke around, and make sure I wasn't being that clingy and annoying girlfriend his friends didn't like. 


Eventually, this past summer, we moved in with each other, along with our good friend/his bandmate. Ended up working at the same company. Spent a lot of time together, most of our day was around each other. But, we also made the time to have our own alone time so we weren't suffocating each other. 


Recently in the past month or so, I noticed he wasn't being himself. He seemed depressed, stressed out, not himself. But, there were outside factors: I had to leave my job because my work schedule and upcoming semester schedule would not work out, so I'm in between jobs right now. He wasn't happy with the direction of his band. Along with normal real world shit. I know money because we had bills stressed us both out, school in general was stressing me out. Just things became shitty, we fell out of the honeymoon phase and the real world hit us hard. But, I always found the time to make sure he felt appreciated and everything was going great. In the past 2 weeks, I had to move out of the place we shared, we made sure we found someone to move in and take the spare room so bills stayed the same. I had spoke with him multiple times about me moving out, and he had promised nothing was going to affect us. And everything was looking up, I recently am in the process of being hired for two seperate jobs, his job is going great, his band is going great, because I didn't have to pay bills anymore I have the extra money to spend on us. Everything has been fucking awesome, except for him being distant. Which I just assumed was because of stress or whatever. 


But, today happened. I had barely slept last night because of being nervous for an interview I had this afternoon, so when I got to my house, I fell asleep and took a nap. Just to kill some time before he came over so I could make dinner and we could just hang out, maybe watch a movie or head over to his place and chill with friends. I don't know, I was just looking forward to seeing him. I was planning on recording some of his music for one of my sound engineering classes, everything seemed normal.


Then around 6:30pm, tonight, he came over, sat down and laid his head on my chest, started tearing up and said. I need to break up with you. My mind immediately went into overdrive. I thought he was kidding since I had just woke up I was in a weird state of mind.


But he was serious. After talking for a good hour, what I had got out of the conversation was that in the past month and a half to 2 months he fell out of love. He sees us as best friends than partners. He also is trying to figure himself out and feels like his life isn't heading in the direction he wants it to and doesn't want to drag me down in the turmoil. He also was planning on doing this a couple weeks ago, but wanted to wait until I was all moved out so it was easier on us. He feels that we're both too young for a serious commitment. There were so many excuses and reasons he said, but the main was he stills loves me but only as a best friend and not in a romantic way.


I've asked if instead of officially ending it, we could just take a break to figure things out, but he doesn't want to give me or himself false hope. I asked what I could do, and he said there's nothing because everything I did was perfect, he just felt he couldn't match up to me and felt like he wasn't good enough for me. I feel the complete opposite.


After laying on my bedroom floor crying that deep ugly cry. We talked briefly through text messages and have decided to talk tomorrow once I get myself together and he sleeps on it.


I don't know what to do. He gave my life meaning, he was my first real true relationship. I love him with all my heart and soul, and thought, and still do, that he is the one.



I'm so lost.

---

**tl;dr**: First real relationship. Boyfriend and I were together 1.5 years, everything was going perfect, even to this day. Then out of complete nowhere, he blindsided me and ended it tonight. I'm crushed and completely lost and don't know what to do with my life.

---

UPDATE*UPDATE*

After a very long, emotional as hell conversation, we've decided this is the best thing for both of us right now. Him and I need to make ourselves happy before we can make us fully happy. We're not doing the whole break thing, we are going to end this little journey and are just going to remove the title of boyfriend and girlfriend. We both realized things have been changing in the past month and it's best to end our romantic relationship before someone gets hurt by getting dragged along. We're still going to keep going on as best friends after the dust has settled. The two of us care too much and have too much love for one another to completely erase each other from our lives.

We started out as best friends, turned into lovers, and came out the best friends we've ever been.

But, I'm not going to lie. It's fucking hard. And it's going to take some time for me to fully accept this. Even tonight it's better, I've stopped hysterically crying every 20 minutes. (It's down to a sob every now and again) Now, I'm slowly start going through the motions of coming to terms with what is going on. But, I (and he's admitted it) know truly, deep down, the love we have for each other is different, and maybe it was just the wrong timing.

Who knows what the hell tomorrow, next week, next month, is going to bring. We could both, in the very end once the debri settles and clears, realize it really wasn't meant to be more than best friends or that we're so damn stupid for thinking we don't need one another. 

We never did anything by the book, we're both weirdos. But, mature, rational, understanding weirdos.

So thank you for everyones kind words and advice, it meant a lot. I'm now going to make myself a cup of strong tea, cuddle with the kitten he gave me at the beginning of our newly blossomed love, and get some actual sleep for the first time in the past 30 hours. Because fuck I am EXHAUSTED.

She has a very strange, sad relationship with her parents (80); she can't stand being around them, and they say rude things to her, but she doesn't stand up for herself. She allows them to show up at her house unannounced whenever they please, to snoop around in her personal things, to demand that she chauffeurs them during their errands without even asking first, etc. Instead, she chooses to just complain to me about the things they do instead of actually talking to them. My grandparents, especially my grandmother, have been abusive towards my mother and her older sisters (58, 60) all their lives. My two aunts have distanced themselves from my grandparents (still in touch, though), but my mother just lets them walk all over her. I feel that since she is expected to do EXACTLY what her mother tells her (at the age of 54), she expects me to do exactly what she wants of me. She and I have butted head for the past few years because I feel she demands unreasonable things of me. Like, when I first moved away, she wanted me to give her my work schedule so she knew what days I had off. That way, she could call and talk to me on the phone for 2+ hours a day or insist that I travel 8 hours round-trip to go home to visit on long stretches off from work. After a while, I realized this was NOT normal, so I refused to do it not too long after that. Eventually, I got a different job with more demands of my time, bought a house in my new town, and met my future husband. I thought she'd understand with all these new things going on in my life, I wouldn't have the time to visit as often as she liked. And its not like she would be making any fun plans for while I was home; most of my evening back in my hometown were sitting on the couch, watching the shitty sitcoms they liked to watch, while everyone had a laptop in their laps playing Farmville. Hopefully that paints a fairly decent picture as to what the family dynamic is here.



Basically, this is my major problem in a nutshell: I tell my mother something she doesn't like (like, I chose not to drive down to visit because I'm busy, or husband (39) and I don't stay as long as she thinks we should for Christmas), she'll cry, throw a tantrum, and demands us to do what she wants. It doesn't work for her (since we have jobs that require us to be at work, of course), so she calls my grandmother, unloads to her about what's going on. Grandmother calls me, doesn't even ask for my side, but just goes on a tirade about how what I'm doing to my mother is bullshit, how I'm going to upset my mother so much that I'm going to kill her, and that I better fix what I broke. All of this because I'm choosing to do home projects on my days off or because I'm staying for the holidays one day less than what she has expected. That's nuts, right??




This particular thing has happened a few times in the last few years, but right now, I'm about ready to fucking crack. A year ago, my father died unexpectedly and I'm still in an awful place because of his death. I really, really miss him. My husband and I trying really hard to get pregnant, but we've been trying a long time now with no luck. Our doctor has recently told us that we will need to get way more invasive in our treatment. Being infertile is terribly depressing, and undergoing the treatments and paying for them is a huge stressor. We're both working extra to help with the cost of fertility treatments. I'm really sad over Dad being gone, depressed about being infertile, and stressed out from working extra hours at a stressful job.




So, apparently, I did it again this week. My mom came right out and asked me why I haven't visited her in over a year. I was honest: I'm still torn up about Dad being gone and I'm so sad to go home and not see him there anymore. Also, I'm terribly allergic to her cats (she's been well aware of this for a while now), and feeling so awful and getting poor sleep while back home makes for a very miserable visit. I said that I felt she would be more hurt at the suggestion of us staying in a hotel, so I've taken advantage of being super busy with a lot of shit going on to not come visit her, because I was afraid that mentioning a hotel would be a really bad thing to do. We have seen her this past year; we've invited her and my brother to stay at our house a few times, and we got hotel rooms for a weekend to celebrate Dad's birthday, so I'm not avoiding her completely. I just can't physically be in her house because of my cat allergies. She seemed fine with us getting a hotel room as long as we visited her more, and I thought it was sorted out. She gave me a good pep talk about my infertility crap going on, and I honestly thought that we had the best conversation we've ever had.




Then my grandmother calls me a few days after my last phone call with my mother and said, I'm worried about your mother. She's so sad that you don't visit her anymore. She called me up crying because you treat her terrible. You never go and see her.

I said, What? This doesn't make any sense. She and I had a really long talk, and I thought we both felt better after that. Why didn't she tell any of this to me?


Well, I don't know, but she was really upset and crying.


By this time, I was mad, because my grandmother is sticking her nose in business that's not hers and was acting really holier-than-thou, so I say, If mom has an issue with me, then she needs to talk with me. No one else. I'm not trying to be rude to you when I say this, but if there's really an issue between her and me, then we're the two who should be talking. This is really none of your business.


I think what I said really struck a nerve, because she said, in a really horrible tone, *You know, your dad's already dead. If you don't stop screwing around and you don't make this right, you're going to lose her too and then you're really gonna be sorry.*

 I just told her that I needed to get off the phone and hung up. I really did not like how she used my dad dying as a weapon to try to guilt me into behaving the way she wants me to behave. Am I being way too sensitive here, though?? What she told me really, really hurt, but am I just being ridiculous, or did what she say was awful?

I'd really like my grandmother to apologize to me, and I'd like my mother to apologize, too. I have a husband over here who cannot believe the dysfunction he's witnessing. He's said he's never leaving me, but he may just snap one day and refuse to see them again. That would put me in a terrible position, but I feel like I should stand with my husband now before I would stand with anyone else. I don't blame him because I'm about ready to throw in the towel myself, but the thought of cutting them out stresses me out and makes me sad. I DO love them all, but it's hard to deal with them. It's actually pretty embarrassing for me to have my husband see all this; his family is really laid back and you can actually tell his mother that you won't be coming over and she doesn't automatically think you hate her. She's not passive aggressive or manipulative. It's... weird to interact with a woman like that.


I really don't want to cut my family off if I can help it. I would really appreciate any help on how I can try to get all of us to be more kind to each other. I have yet to talk to my mother about this phone call I had with my grandmother. Any suggestions on how to make that as painless as possible?

11468,Breakups,2p1dgy," And she decided to stay. Some back story, we dated for 3 months and I (m28) know that isn't a very long time but the circumstances were different then any relationship I've ever had.

 She's from the US and im in Canada so she came up for a visit and decided to stay. We rented a apt and bought a dog and had a wonder little life together. Never fought or anything, just happiness. 

Then comes the holidays. I decided to send her back for a xmas present cause I know how much she missed her friends and family. She'd be gone for thanksgiving, her birthday, Xmas and new years and id stay home and take care of the dog.

 The day after her birthday she texts me tell me shes confused and every thing there feels different. So I called her and she laid it all out on the table and told me she wants to learn how to live on her own before having a relationship and that shes not going to come back home. 

That was 5 days ago. I packed all her clothes and gave the dog up for adoption (it would sit at our bedroom door and wait for her all day so I figured he needed a new home, thou I miss the little bugger). Im taking this so hard, I've never cried so much in my life.  I really want her to live the life she needs to but this abandonment of everything we started just eats at me. To the point I want to move away and start over somewhere new. I'm lost and need guidance.

11469,Relationships,1z7b3e,"Hi everyone. I really need some advice here. I'm hurt and I'm angry and I don't know if I should be either or both or how to even go about dealing with this. 

First off as a disclaimer I am in no way opposed to masturbation in/out of a relationship. It's perfectly natural and healthy.

However I feel uncomfortable with my fiancée masturbating next to me in bed. I just don't know what to do and I feel awkward about it.

We have a great relationship and he's a fantastic guy. We're very honest and open with each other. You may be asking why don't you just tell him your uncomfortable, thing is, I have. 

The first time it happened, I sat him down and we talked about it. He was very understanding and said it wouldn't happen again. But a few months later it did. He woke me up in the middle of the night and I was just so uncomfortable, I didn't know what to. I confronted him in the morning and he apologised, said he thought I was asleep...

Which to be honest, pissed me off. As if it was ok if I wasn't aware it was happening?! Anyway he promised it wouldn't happen again. But it did last night.

A little bit of history here, my fiancée suffers from erectile dysfunction. We have had many ups and downs in our sexual life and I will be the first to admit we rarely have sex. He's rarely in the mood and when he is 90% of the time his erection would be gone before we would reach penetration. He used to be very selfish in that the second it was gone, so was he and I would never be satisfied. When he does manage to keep it up long enough he lasts far far too long. We're talking 45mins to an hour here. And we always jump straight to penetration because he might lose it. So I'm stuck lying there for 45mins bone dry... It wasn't a great time for me. Recently I've started being more assertive and making sure it's not all about him and that I have to be involved too.

So I have to lie there pretending I'm asleep for 45mins. I know I should have said something but I was so cross that I just couldn't. We would have had a huge fight and I'd have gotten even less sleep. I haven't confronted him yet. Am I being stupid?? I feel like he has no respect for me. And that hurts. I really need a second opinion here. I went to bed to read an hour before him last night. If he was horny, why didn't he just come on up to me? 

I feel humiliated and disrespected. We're supposed to be getting married next year. Is this what the rest of my life will be like? Being uncomfortable and unsatisfied? Or am I the one in the wrong here?

11471,Breakups,1i51x3,"Highschool sweethearts, we just broke up after a year. As we were both going to separate colleges 2 hours apart, when we talked about staying together I told her I didn't think we should. I knew I wasn't in love with her, and she wasn't with me, and rather than watch us drift apart, I thought it would be better to end it. We decided to see how we felt about it at the end of the summer.

A week later, we talk again. She asked me if I wanted to continue to the end of the summer, and though I had planned on it, I hesitated. She said we were done then and I just silently agreed. None of the circumstances had changed, and so we broke up.

Now though, I'm not sure. I know it would be cruel to her to ask for her back after I put her through a breakup, but I just didn't think the hurt would be this bad. We did everything together for a whole year- now everywhere I look I can't help remember the time we cooked dinner or how we snuck in a quick kiss or how she helped me pack for vacation. She was such a huge part of my life for so long, and now it feels like the days are a little emptier.

That last talk we had keeps haunting me though. I told her part of the reason I thought we should split was because I couldn't see myself with her by the end of college, and definitely not after, or even marrying her one day. We only just graduated highschool, and I know we're still just kids, and she said that most couples like us just take it a month at a time or so. It just hurts wondering if we could have made it after all. Did I make the right choice by looking ahead that far? Or did I screw up something good?

I would have put this into /r/breakups but I don't necessarily want advice for moving on, I just need to know if I made an ass out of myself by trying to be too mature.

We had a lot of talks about how it took me time to open up to people and trust them.  He opened up to me very quickly and said that he felt very comfortable around me.  I was slowly starting to open up to him, but we didn't get the chance to spend that much time together.

He has a very complicated past, full of sadness and trauma, which I thought I could deal with.  But he put me through an emotional rollercoaster of telling me his strong feelings and then pushing me away because he was scared that I would hurt him.  

The last night that we were together I was very clear with him that I was confused about where things were headed.  I was confused about my feelings for him.  He told me that he understood and that I didn't need to be worried because he would understand whatever decision I made and accept it. 


So, I broke up with him on Tuesday night.  I told him that the ups and downs in the relationship were too much for me to handle.  That I didn't want to go further, and have his feelings grow stronger and hurt him more... and so forth.  That I just didn't think continuing to date would be a good thing for me.

Tonight he told me that he felt hurt and sad by me.  That he wished we had talked more about it before we made this decision. That he wanted to keep trying and repair things... And then he told me that he slept with someone on Wednesday.

It hit me so hard.  I can't understand why he would tell me something like that.  I feel sad that he felt he needed to hurt me.  I can't stop crying and feeling like an idiot for thinking that I mattered to him. He said he doesn't know why I'm so upset and doesn't think that I cared about him at all.

11473,Relationships,1jrq1b,"I really hope this is the right subreddit for this, sorry if it is a bit long. I'll start with a few details. We'll call the cousin Daniela and my husband Aaron. I have been in a relationship with my Husband about 6 years now, but I grew up with him (we have been good friends since kindergarten and started dating our Jr. year of high school) He is my first everything (kiss, sex, love, etc.). I am his first and only love and sexual encounter.

In the beginning after me and my husband had been dating 6 months, his 3 younger female cousins were coming to stay with them for a week. I was so excited to meet them and also pretty nervous because I wanted to make a good impression on them. There was Kristine (15 at the time), Daniela (14 at the time) and Marcy (maybe 9 or 10 at the time). Me and my husband were both barley 17 at the time). I'll write everything that happened out in the next paragraph.

Basically, They all seemed to like me. (note, i was never a super tiny girl, I was 5'7 and weighed about 160) Daniela and Kristine were and still are very short. about 2 or 3 feet shorter than me and pretty petite. Well, the third day I went to visit them, Daniela basically BEGGED Aarons parents for me to spend the night. They said it was fine but Aaron had to sleep in his room and what not. So his parents called my parents and asked if it was okay and told them they wouldn't let us sleep in the same room, and that it was for the cousins. My parents said okay so me and the cousins went to get my pajamas and stuff.

Fast forward to that night, Daniela was acting strange towards me. Smirking at me and just being overly nice. She Insisted we play truth or dare. (it was be me, kristine, daniela, and Aarons little brother John(13 at the time) ) So we finally decide to do it. Aaron is in his room sleeping because his parents said they wanted us apart. I go first, and I choose truth, Daniela gets the BIGGEST smile on her face and says okay, do you think aaron would ever cheat on you, what would you do? Me, being young and in love at this point (another note, just a week or so before this me and Aaron had had sex the first time), answered Oh, aaron isn't like that, he would never cheat on me. I know it. then she kept pushing it. And I kept saying the same thing, every time she just laughed at me. it made me really uncomfortable and feel like she knew something I didn't. It came to be my turn again, and I chose dare, she dared me to drink some of her spit. So I did (and almost gagged, i HATE spit) But then she started bugging me saying you should tell Aaron you did that, it's like an indirect kiss, actually just tell him you kissed me. this had me even more confused. after that she told me to go in another room because she had to talk to Kristine and John and it was family related and private. So i go in another room, don't hear anything said and next thing I know john runs into aarons room and asks him something. I have NO idea what is going on at this point, And go to bed feeling like confused and like shit. 

The next morning I ask Aaron what was everyone making a fuss about last night? and he says Oh, I don't remember, I was asleep. So I just left it. Well, the NEXT day, Daniela takes me into a room, and tells me so, every night, Aaron comes in and touches me and kisses me. It makes me so uncomfortable and I don't know what to do, I just had to tell you While she said this, she had a smirk on her face and seriously didn't act like someone who had been violated by a family member, she looked happy about it. I was livid. Aaron saw me and Daniela come out of the room and I guess something about my face made his face just drop. I said I had to go and he followed me out to my car. He tried to stop me from leaving and asked what was wrong. I said did you kiss Daniela???  and he was quiet and looked at the ground. I was seriosly FALLING apart at this point. I asked again slowly through clenched teeth DID YOU KISS DANIELA and he let out a meek yes. I basically blacked out at this point from hurt and anger, So i do not remember what I did. My next memory I was at my friend jerods house crying (I barley new jerod, he was just the closest person I knew lived near by) I told him everything that had happened. He calmed me down and told me I need to talk to Aaron about what happened and get his side of the story. So The next day (after crying all night and not being able to eat anything) I went to talk to him. He told me that ONE night, not every night, him and his cousins were sleeping in the living room on the floor, and that daniela had started kissing him while he was sleeping, and he was half asleep so he woke up and kissed her back for maybe a minute or 2. (to which I thought, how in the FUCK to you kiss your FUCKING cousin back for 2 minutes!) Note, at the time they thought they were 1st cousins. turns out they are actually 3rd cousins(found that out last year actually). 

Anyway, I decided to believe him, and I was kind of right to (you'll see why i still wasn't in later paragraphs). Because Apparently jessica had this creepy crush on him and Hated me instantly because I basically took her boyfriend away from her. (they were kissing cousins when they were just kids. Hey, kids are curious so it's not to big a deal, but if it happens when you are 17 years old you should know it's fucking wrong -_- ) So I try to make peace with both of them, while crying every night and wanting to die because it hurt so much (teen heart break, plus my boyfriend had just CHEATED ON MY WITH HIS COUSIN). Okay, so It eventually gets to me, and I tell his parents, they make Daniela go home, and shame their son for what happened. They grounded him from me for a few days then invited me over. I talked to them and cried and they asked what we were going to do, If I was going to stay with Aaron or leave him. His mom was ignoring him and saying he was disgusting and his dad said If he were me he would drop him like a rock. Well, IDK why, but i decided to stay with him. But that incident, really just killed my innocence. Part of me was broken and would never be fixed.  

Now, that is how it ALL started, after that I had insecurities about him being at family parties with herm or going on family vacations (like rocky point and florida) I asked him to not talk to her or interact with her and he said he wouldn't. Then later I asked if he talked to her at all and he said no then I see Face book pictures that he is tagged in of him and her hanging out and being close (with other cousins around).  I ask him why he lied, he said he didn't want to up set me. And for SOME reason I STILL decided to stay with him. 

He isn't an ass hole or anything, in fact he is one of the sweetest guys out there. He is easy going and almost NEVER gets angry. Even if he does, it only lasts for about 10 or 20 minutes. He just had a bit of a lying problem (which is fixed now, just recently got fixed this past year for good) (also, i am confused because i actually found out THIS YEAR that she didn't kiss Aaron while he was asleep, they mutually decided to make out. I find this out AFTER and and Aaron are married and have a 2 year old daughter (btw, he didn't want to be a dad and wasn't there for my pregnancy until AFTER the baby was a month old. stupid scared kid he is. Fuck me right??? )
 
Onto the WHOLE reason I posted this question, I hate Daniela now. Before, I was never ANYTHING but nice to her. (as i am with everyone, she is literally my only enemy) Even AFTER she made my Boyfriend cheat on me I was nice to her, Yet she still treated me like shit and still does. I think she honestly liked Aaron and thought they could be together(it doesn't help that they look so much alike! sometimes I see him and immediately think of her) . My problem is, it's like i'm obsessed with her. She is the ONLY person that can get under my skin. She always would message me and tell me that Aaron kissed me because I wasn't good enough. Me and Aaron are happy now, everything is perfect. Yet I cannot get that stupid bitch out of my head (and honestly, half of her family thinks she is a bitch and there is something wrong with her) I find my self checking her FB with my husbands profile (I blocked her on mine because she was starting shit) Just because I want to see her fail I also check her instagram (i asked his cousin kristine for her account to see it..... She (daniela) got pregnant last year(during her sr. year of highschool) and has a baby now, she also lives in germany(has only been there a few months) with her husband who she made join the air force recently (my husband is in the Air force, has wanted to be in since he was just a kid and is now and has been in for about 4 years now). And I hate my self because the whole pregnancy all I thought was I hope she has complications and stuff It made me feel like a horrible person. I would check her profiles all the time, to see how she was doing. And hoping she would post some depressed shit because I didn't want her to be happy. Hell, I still don't. I don't know what to do! it's like I am obsessed with her. I hate her and we haven't even talked very much in the past few years!!! it's like, she's ruining my life and she isn't even in it anymore!!!! do i need therapy to get over this or something??? And I probably never even cross her mind (me and Aaron are doing WAY better than her BTW which makes me happy) what do i do to stop obsessing over her???  what is wrong with me???   


**tl;dr**: I hate my husbands cousin, she helped him cheat on me with her when we were first dating(details are in the big paragraphs), she is evil and I obsess over her and always check her Facebook, instagram, and twitter to see if she is having a hard time, which makes me feel good when she is. How do i get over this shit???? what is wrong with me?? also, sorry for any mistakes.....

Edit: I forgot, I sometimes have dreams about making up and being friends with her. In every dream we are crying hugging and saying we are sorry. (idk why I need to apologize, she is the one who always ruined my life....and i never did anything to her !!!!)

Edit 2: It wasn't just that one time that she pissed me off. I actually wrote her about a year after everything happened and said that i forgive her for what happened in the past and that I wanted to move past it so it isn't all awkward at family gatherings. She basically said alright. At all family gatherings we were both at she treated me like shit still. I did the mature thing and was nice to her, ALWAYS, I hate confrontation. She wrote nasty things on stuff I posted on my Facebook, which led to me deleting her and blocking her (this was all within the last three years). She would text me and message me about how i wasn't good enough for david and about how I was a bad person. I swear on my life, that I have never been mean to this girl. I have always done the mature thing and even though I didn't like her I was nice to her. I didn't talk shit about her (until I called her a bitch in this post because it just all built up)","Me[22/F] with my husbands[21/M] cousin [19F], we've known eachother for 6 years, I hate her and it scares me.",0.0,False,0.0,14.0,1375740494.0,/r/relationships/comments/1jrq1b/me22f_with_my_husbands21m_cousin_19f_weve_known/,Romantic

I don't say this to demonize her or make her out to be a bad person, but she has BPD and I think that that somehow plays a factor in how the relationship turned out.


When we first started dating, and it seems like such a long time ago, we started off slow. I was going through a very hard time with my father who had a stroke, I was practically living in a stroke ward for a long time. When she came into my life I felt so happy because finally, someone who can support me through this hard time! Someone to be there for me! We met when she added me to facebook randomly because she found me cute and we had a lot of mutual friends. I was attracted to her because she had a lot of the same experiences as me, we were very similar in so many ways. Eventually, as things started to get more serious, we got very close and comfortable with each other in a short period of time, and we would spend entire days together on dates. Even if we werent doing anything in particular, we would still just enjoy each others company. We did everything together. We played shitty old retro games, we went for walks, we sang together, we had philosophical deep talks, we went to parties, we drank, we went out to restaurants. She was beautiful in my eyes, she swept me off my fucking feet.


I was head over heels for her. I told my friends and family about her and all the small things that made me smile. Like how she took care of me when I was sick or how we were okay with just sitting around watching netflix doing nothing in particular. 


I felt so comfortable with her because I could be my strange self around her and she accepted me for who I am. It felt like she was reading my mind at times. 


The day that she left me, she said that she still hadn't gotten over her feelings for her ex and that it was not fair to me for her to have feelings for both me and him. Which, I understood and respected her for being straightforward with me. It bothered me though,because I knew she was texting her ex but I figured I did not want to be possessive or clingy so I let it go. It hurt because I felt lied to in a way.
After the breakup, I felt so conflicted because I couldn't accept that it was over. She was still mine in my mind, I couldn't give her up. Which lead to feelings of guilt because how dare I be possessive, she is free to do whatever she wants now.


Shortly after the breakup,we talked about the idea of calling it a break rather than a full-on breakup. I said I would consider the idea but I would need my space. Keeping in mind that I was hurt and scared, I wanted to put her out of my mind as much as possible so I tried to avoid contact as much as possible with her.


About a month after the breakup, after she had deleted me off of facebook I got a text from her. I dont remember the exact words but it went something like èstop ignoring me like a 5 year old and tell me why you are upset with me.è I told her that I felt like I wasnt given space and that she didnt have a right to chastize me because SHE broke up with ME. She responded with something like ÈJust because you are hurt does not mean that you can keep trying to find things to blame me for. È Moreso,I was confused as to why she was contacting me because it was over...It took me so by surprise, she brought up things from weeks ago that she could have just talked to me about when it happened rather than collecting all these bad things and ostracizing me for it. 


After the breakup, I did not want to hang out with friends because she WAS my friend.
The hardest part of this is that I cannot stop thinking about her. I feel like I shouldnt still have feelings for her because its over, she left me and hurt me, and i cant get back the past. I keep thinking *I just want her back. I was so happy with her.* And whenever I think of her I feel like crying. And I think about her all the time. It hurts,almost physically, to reminice about it. My stomach is in knots and my heart beats. I hate being alone now because it means I just keep thinking and thinking.Nothing seems to help, I mean I go about my daily life but I dont feel like dating anyone at the moment. its such a weird feeling. I feel like I am never going to find anyone who will understand me like she did, and Im afraid of being alone forever as irrational as that sounds. Which leads me to want to start dating again but I feel so low about myself that I doubt it would do me any good.I cant even take my mind off of it, I cant focus on anything else.


I feel like I should not be as depressed as I am over it because the relationship was only a month long one, but in that month I got very attached. I keep thinking What did I do wrong! How can I change myself! Did she leave me because of how I am, because I am inadequite or some other glaring character flawÉWhat could I have done DIFFERENTLY to make things alright between usÉ Is this what happens in a normal relationshipÉThe MOST wrorying thought is: Do I have BPD as well if I was so similar to herÉ Will I ever be good enough for a healthy relationship againÉ It feels like I will have a hard time trusting again. I would really appreciate any wisdom or insight because as much as I want to be able to man up and get over it on my own I know I just cant. Am I normal for feeling this wayÉ

tl;dr Got in relationship with girl who is similar to me in every way imaginable but suffers from BPD, I was caring for father who suffered a stroke in hospital at the time, fell head over heels in love, she left me because she had feelings for ex,wanted to call it a break but then texts me when I want space,then sends me texts that took me off guard. I am confused about my feelings.

11475,Relationships,1umyqk,"My SO is amazing! Supportive, funny, smart, ect. His major flaw is he has no life skills. 

He doesn't know how to make professional calls, fill out a job application, shop for certain items, speak to someone in a position of authority or write formal emails. He can't write a resume, doesn't know how to speak up or make quick decisions in a emergency.  


He'll try doing the things somewhat, but it always comes with a million questions. He won't do anything if I don't tell him exactly how to do it. I've had several medical emergencies where I've had to instruct him while in pain or half conscious on what to do. 

He freezes up and just asks What do I do?. If he's not explicitly told what to do, he'll be lost for hours. He won't speak to people unless I tell him what to say before hand. 

For example: if he has any appointments, I have to set them up. I also have to deal with all the bills or sorting out issues with companies. He won't talk to people over the phone or in person unless I coach him. Even something as simple as calling a taxi. He'll refuse, then give in and ask what to say. If I tell him to figure it out, he'll stay silent and then ask again and again until I give in and give him a script.


His social/problem solving skills are zero. We've been living together a year now but it doesn't improve.

I don't mind helping him out or offering guidance, but I feel like I'm parenting him. 

I'm worried this could be social anxiety or something serious.

When he's comfortable with the people he is speaking to, he can be charismatic and funny. He understand what's appropriate and inappropriate. But under pressure he freezes. I'm at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do. 

I've suggested counseling, but he was against it. 

(Although that may be a cultural thing. His family is from a Latin country and doesn't place any merit in therapy. They are very old fashioned) 

tl;dr: My SO freezes up and wants to be told word-for-word what to do and say in social situations or situations where he's under pressure. 




Edit: He says he feels like they are judging him or will make fun of him after the situation is over. He's afraid of angering or annoying people in authority positions. He's extremely self conscious and introverted. He's not lazy either. He cleans the entire apartment, he does grocery shopping by himself now, he'll fix things around the apartment or does romantic surprises. Now that I taught him to cook, he also does that as well or we do it together. But dealing with emergencies and social situations is where he struggles.

11477,Dating,2u5vkt,"Throwaway because my siblings reddit.

I guess I should start with some backstory. I come from a really tight knit family. There's four siblings, two sisters and two brothers. The girls are the oldest and I'm the youngest of all of us, putting my brother in the middle. We all remain close even though some of us have started our own families, live out of state, and generally lead pretty hectic lives. We tell each other almost everything. 

My brother started dating his ex, Emily, in the summer of 2013. They took things pretty slow at first because he has a son [6yr] from a previously relationship but I know he fell hard for her and vice versa. In retrospect, the whole family almost immediately loved her. She's drop dead gorgeous, funny, and really intelligent. She just fit in so well with everyone. My parents used to joke that if brother messed it up that they had a backup son for her, since they wanted her apart of the family.  They dated for a little over a year before calling it quits. They were long distance (he lives out of state) and just couldn't make it work. I know the time frame wouldn't seem long to most people but my brother has always been kinda picky when it comes to dating, even more so once he had his son. I know he deeply cares for her even to this day. They ended things on really good terms and remain pretty good friends.

Over the course of their relationship I got close to Emily as well. Not in an inappropriate way at all, just friendly. My brother and I are close so it's natural that we become good friends with each other's SO. Her and I lived near each other too so it was easy to intertwine our circle of friends for occasional bar crawls, football parties, etc. After the breakup she went MIA for a while, but slowly has been resurfacing. My sisters have gone out to lunch/shopping with her a few times and all of us (sans brother, as he lives out of state) have gotten together for a drink or two. It's not weird for any of us, at least I don't think so. 

We're arranging a super bowl party and one of my sister's brought up inviting Emily, which is a no brainier. The other sister then divulged that Emily has started dating again although it's nothing serious, just dates here and there. We all expressed how we wish her and our brother could've worked out. Then it kinda hit me that...I want to date her.

I've always been attracted, I can't deny that. But it was always more of an observation than anything hey, brother's girlfriend is smoking hot. And we've always gotten along really great, we click. For some reason my sister bringing up the fact that she's started dating made me realize there's no way this girl stays single for long and I want my shot. The selfish part of me keeps saying that she's not my brother's girlfriend anymore and if there's chemistry there I should give it a shot. The sane side of me keeps saying is that it's a dick move and I shouldn't even be considering it. I was the one that helped my brother through the breakup, I know that he's probably still not over it. 

I'm going to end this before I really start to ramble. But reddit, what do I do? I'm suddenly crushing so bad for this girl and I know I can't do this to my brother even though part of me really wants to just see if I have a chance. I know going NC would probably make the feelings subside but she's a pretty integrated part of my own circle of friends now, even without my siblings.

We broke up I was upset as most break-ups are but it was very manageable even though he was my first boyfriend and I lost my virginity too him. Now his best friend who I was very close too (in a friendship way) knew me also throughout that whole relationship we started seeing each other after me and my ex broke-up and now have been dating for 5 months.

 I always had feelings for him and he has as well for a good two years now. The problem is that he feels really, really guilty for what he's done and it's started impacting the way he treats me around his friends, like won't hug me or talk to me really. 

Now his best friend said it was okay for him to date me.

TL:DR: (I'd really like you to read it but okay. ) SO broke up with boyfriend for -not- me, for freedom. SO visits me in another state and we do the dirty until our friends ( 1 girl 1 unexpected guy ) come up from another state 2 days later. 1 Girl's BF is my friend and gets me paranoid about unfaithfulness to whatever me and SO are ( not together, but claimed by each other ) I start nit picking things that could be a distance between us, and eventually a thing that bothered the shit out of me. They all leave to go down a state because the girls are going to spend a lot of time together, since they don't have super girlfriends. A nice metaphor about poodles and deep thought at Waffle House. I won't know what to do if things turn bad. 



So, let's take it from the very top. My SO will just be called SO for this. Comment at the bottom explains time length. (Now with less length and TL:DR at the top. )

I met my SO through video games, and we started hitting it off really well. Talking every day about anything and everything. 

Come to find out later down the road, she has a boyfriend. 

We keep talking every day, and eventually feelings come out everywhere from happy feelings of how much we care about each other, to lustful feelings. We Eventually arrange for me to come out and see her. 

I saw her about a month and a half ago, and everything went well. She told her boyfriend that she was going out to see a concert. 

We get there, everything is great and she's just perfect. We do the dirty, go on vacation, do the dirty more and what have you. 

She's not real big on holding hands in public, but she did, but we mostly just did our thing behind closed doors, and that's when most of the intimate closeness came into play. 

She broke up with him when she got back. Now, an important note that was made clear to me; she didn't leave him for me in a relationship, she left him because I opened up her eyes to how free she could be. Remember that, I think it's important.

So moving on, over the next month we arrange another meeting and we're all hyped for it. She occasionally calls me 'mine' and she's 'mine' but we've yet to put a label on what we are. She doesn't want to get into another relationship after she just got out of one, that much is clear. 

So, that month passes and she's out here. We previously arranged that our, mostly her, female friend, 18, is coming up from another state. New to me, however, is the male friend she's bringing up. 

Don't get me wrong, I completely trust her. I have faith, I'm hers, she's honest with me, and she has lots of guy friends back home that want her but she doesn't give them any. Only people she's been with was me and her ex. So, I'm cool with it as long as he's cool.

There are two days that it's just me and her together, and we get a hotel and sleep for a few hours, wake up and do the dirty, watch a movie, do it more, fall asleep, wake up, do it more, then go out for the day. 

Nothing is changed behind closed doors,  from the last time. We still cuddle, we had just as much intimacy, nothing is different.

We get back and repeat, wake up repeat, then chill until her friend gets there that night. The guy is cool, shakes my hand, refers to her as 'my girl' and that's fine with me. We go out and stuff, drink and all back at the hotel room. 

We're all having a good time, and the guy crashed early. Her friend and her sat on the bed, and I laid wrapped around my SO. She didn't mind it, only hitting me playfully when I got too grabby because drinks. When all three of us laid down, we slept with her spooning her friend, and me spooning her.

Eventually she flips over and lays opposite. I wake up in the middle of the night and think nothing of it, and just curl next to her facing the other way. We wake up the next morning, her friend asked why we flopped and she responded that she was hot. That morning when we were alone in our room, we did the dirty again.

So the next day while we're all out my friend who is my SO's friends, boyfriend- we'll call him Tim- calls me. He is wondering how the guy is like, how is he acting, whatever. I told him he's fine for now and I'll watch him. 

During the day we're walking around and I pick up on just unconscious ( I assume ) things; She's hardly walking with me, not really engaging me in conversation but instead her friends, she's walking either beside her friend or the guy, she's taking minimum pictures of me, and more focused on her friend or the guy. 

It's not a problem, I'm thinking, she wants to absorb the moment because she knows they won't be as like, around as I will be- plus they're new people to her ( Long Distance meet ups ), so it's understandable. 

I don't try to hold her hand or anything, but she's either walking by herself or with the other two by the end of the day and I insert myself when it's her and the guy. Just a guy thing, even though we're not in a relationship. 

We go out to the woods that night and make a fire, but before that Tim calls me up and I speak to him in private. Apparently, my SO's friend has been telling Tim that there's some kind of distance between us. 

Now Tim can be kinda a dick. He puts all these thoughts in my head about her not being as loyal because we don't have a title in our relationship. I counter him, and refuse to accept that. I tell him I know, however, I have no say or claim in what she does. I tell her to do what makes her happy, and I'm here to make her happy as well. If making her happy is going to a ladies club, or a club in general to grind on people- I really don't care. I won't like the grinding part, but it doesn't bother me to any major extent. Tim responds to my 'do whatever makes her happy' with; You don't think sleeping with some random guy would make her happy? 

I was pretty pissed about that, saying that she's unloyal and eluding that. I get pissed and hang up the phone. I collect myself before we go out to make a fire. 

So we're around the fire just chilling, laughing, etc. I'm sitting next to her, she's sitting next to her friend, and the guy is on the other side of the fire. 

Each time I put my hand on her back, she moves away to lean over her friend. Which is fine, whatever, the whole PDA thing. 

During conversation we're all talking, and  she's again engaging more with the guy rather than with me, but usually her friend takes priority. 

Eventually the girls go out to look for a club and come back at 2:00 am while I'm taking a nap and the guy is in his and my SO's friend's room, chillin. 

I wake up and I'm tired, because I hardly slept. They got their things, said they didn't go to a club, and were going over to the other room. In a haze I ask if they want me with, and I ask my SO directly if they want me to come with and I get a distracted question or a response to something her friend said. Whatever, I set my alarm for an hour an I'll be over there then. 

I sleep past my alarm and it's the next day. Nobody ever came and got me. So I wake up and walk over there and knock on the door, after getting coffee for the SO. 

The guy opens the door, no shirt, and I say what's up and come in. I asked where SO is, and he said in the bathroom. Her blanket she sleeps with is on his bed, as well as one of her socks. 

She comes out and says hi to me, and he lays back down. Her friend wakes up and she lays on her bed. We make small talk, she drinks her coffee and we get ready to drive to see her other friend in another state. 

I see, as she's getting her stuff, that she's wearing her friends pants and her pants were discarded in between the two beds. Also, her main top is off and it's just her sleeveless, low cut thing and a bra on. I keep my cool and tell myself it was probably nothing. She's not like that.

Eventually the conversation gets to what all happened last night, and they were all really drunk. Her friend took a long bath, spilled beer on her bed, and fell asleep first. I assume that my SO and the guy followed shortly after, only she couldn't sleep in the bed with her friend, so instead of coming back to our room she slept in the bed with the guy. 

I know nothing happened. She would have felt too guilty, or her friend would have told Tim and Tim would have told me. The girls went back to sleep for an hour and me and the guy walked around the woods. He seemed chill, and when I asked if she slept in the bed with him he said yes without skipping a beat, and we dropped it. I didn't have the heart to ask him if he tried anything. 

We get back and I lay down with her for about two minutes before she gets up and starts walking around, getting her stuff ready to go. She then brought up she doesn't want to go, texted her friend in another state that she doesn't have the money to go, and then is committing to going back down with her friend that's here with us now, to the state that she's in. 

When we go back to our room to pack, she asks me if I want to go down to &amp;amp;amp;lt;state&gt; I say 'yes' but does she want me to go down to &amp;amp;amp;lt;state&gt;. She explains that she really wants to have girls nights out, and spend a lot of time with her friend because she doesn't really have a girlfriend or many friends back home. I understand, slightly. She explains further that I would just be at the hotel at nights, bored, while they were out at 21+ clubs. Thankfully, guy is also -21. She also really wanted to focus on her friend. I nod and say okay, and she seemed happy about it. When we got to talking about last night, I asked if she slept in his bed and she said yes without skipping a beat. I didn't want to start anything by asking if he tried anything. 

We never fight, just something to add.

Her friend gets there and I can't get her to focus on a conversation with me anymore. 

It's also worth noting now, that one of the days that we went to go hang out with my local friends, before her friend it here, she said 'They know we aren't dating, right? I don't know if you know that, but yea.' I quickly responded 'Yea.' As to not cause an issue. Still haven't talked to her about it, never got her alone to do so.

As we load up the vehicle I get her alone for a slight second. 
'Ight, have fun.' I said as I hugged her.
'Okay I will.' She said.
'I'll miss ya.'
'Ill miss you too.'
Then I tilt her chin up for a half a second kiss.
'Alright, text me, send pictures! See you Saturday when you get back.' She shouts back okay and loads into the passenger seat with her friend driving, guy in the backseat. Her flight leaves out of my state, so she's gotta come back. 

As I get in the car and close the door I start to feel some kind of emotion in my chest and as they pull away I do too, staying behind them for a good distance. After a little bit everything Tim had said to me seeped into my head, giving me horrible thoughts and I just start bawling. Full out, never before seen this bad, tears. Screaming, wailing, all from about a football fields distance from my SO on a curvy road. 

As they pull off to a gas station I get stopped on a light. I knew she had to pee. By gods crewel joke I saw the guy get out the back seat and walk in, and her follow suit twenty seconds after. Jogging up to either catch up with him as he opened to door, or catch the door. Either way, in my conflicted mind it just looked bad.

I cry and scream for about 5 miles before I pull off behind a McDonalds because I can't drive anymore. I cry for about 10 min before Tim texts me and asks what's going on, because SO's friend won't text him back. I call him and explain as calm as I can, before he calls me out for sounding upset.

I don't mention the bed thing, that was nothing. It's the fact that the distance that they were concerned about before-- I felt it. I blamed it on the fact that she's not about PDA and what not, but he insist that's it's something deeper. He calms me down by explains to give her distance, because she'll see after she's done having fun that she needs me. That she'll come back with even more want for me after this mini-trip.

That gets me a little ways, and I get to a Waffle House and drink a coke for two hours, thinking about everything that's gone on.

I asked myself, where did I go wrong, why this, why now while we're here together-- and came up with the following;

I introduced her to this life of freedom, and since we're not together I can't demand that she pay more attention to me, or even request it. If I did that, or I needed to be in a state of getting affection, rather than just behind closed doors, I would be acting just like her ex boyfriend and she'd bug out. She doesn't want a relationship right now, but all I want is her loyalty to me when she does. That being said, she can fuck a random guy as long as a) I don't find out and b) feelings aren't involved. And c) She'll always be mine when she's ready for a relationship. 

I also thought that it's very possible I'm overreacting. I love this girl, she means the world to me, and I've changed my whole future and accidentally burned too many bridges for her. She's all that I got left, and if I don't have her in my life I don't know what I'd do.

While I was at Waffle House Tim was texting me, and he put it this way;

SO is a poodle. 

Tim thinks that this is my state of mind; 
The poodle is out in the yard playing, and won't come back inside when asked. 

Tim thinks the poodle ran away, and I'm waiting on the porch for it to come back. He said, 'If it does, rejoice but if it doesn't go back inside and wait for it to scratch at the door.'

I think the poodle is out in the yard playing around with whatever, and I'm waiting on the porch with the door open waiting for her to come back inside- with a smile on my face. Sometimes she comes over and licks my leg or plays with me before going out in the yard- but that's okay. 

Or, the poodle is out on a play date and just doesn't want affection right now and this whole thing is just me and Tim and Tim's GF overreacting, which would be the BEST case scenario. 


So, what do you guys think? Overreacting, or perfectly sane? She comes back Saturday, and I plan on talking about it with her then. Tim is still very bent on the running away scenario.

About the relationship and kids issue...


So we're perfect for each other, except that she's 5 years older. We've talked about marriage and are committed to each other. The only issue is the topic of kids. 


**Her:** She's determined to raise a kid, especially because her childhood was rocky (dad died at an early age and mom is nuts) and she wants to give a child a better life opportunity than she had, regardless of whether it's biological or adopted.


**Me:** I don't want kids at all. Can't see myself having a child, and it scares me to think about the responsibility of it all. My dad didn't have me until he was 43, and I want to live my youth childless. I am open to the possibility of having a kid in my late thirties, but not before that. Even then, I'm still not really interested having a kid. They're cute and fun, but not all the time, in my ignorant opinion.


**More info:** The topic came up last night, and she mentioned having a kid. She wants a kid in 5-7 years (she'd be 35-37). For me, that's really terrifying because I'd be only 30-32, which in my opinion is really young. Basically she says it's a deal breaker if I decide I don't want kids, because she wants enough time to find someone to be the guy she has kids with, even though she doesn't really want anyone else. Here's the thing: Everything works so well with us currently that I don't know what to think. Here are the questions I keep having...

* If we break up over our difference in opinions, will I think of it as a mistake later?
* Will I find someone else as amazing as her?
* What if I want kids later in my thirties after we end and she's already moved on?
* If we break up, since we're living together, most of our furniture and stuff is hers, and she keeps our cats, so I'd be left to start from scratch (i.e. moving back in with parents maybe? finding much cheaper studio, moving out of the city, etc.)
* Is all the stuff I'd be sacrificing worth not having a kid in 5-10 years? 
* Is having a kid in 5-10 years worth sacrificing the 20 years of raising them?

I understand my view towards children is very limited, and I'd love any input, be it on why kids are great, why kids suck, advice on what to do, or what you did (if your situation applies). 

Anyone else ever been in a situation where you've risked losing the love of your life based on giant life decisions? Did you leave them or stay and change?

My husband and I have been together for almost 5 years now. We are currently LDR because I am finishing my degree back in the states and it's very difficult to find an english course for my major in his country. 

We spent the summer together and I came back home in August. We have been planning to see eachother for Christmas for months now. He would have been ordering the ticket this coming week. I have been buying presents, and getting ready to see him by having a bunch of places for us to go for the holidays.

Today he calls me on skype and tells me I have some bad news. He told me his mother's wedding falls on Dec. 27th and that he can't come because he can't miss her wedding. He only gets a few days off for holidays and he planned to take off unpaid to see me, but that would be if he came earlier in December. To say that I was crushed was an understatement. I have been looking forward to spending christmas together for months and having it ripped away like that just broke me. I started to cry and he said he was sorry but he couldn't miss his mom's wedding. 

His mother and him have not been close. She has not been the best mother and often brought home bad boyfriends who would abuse her and my husband as a kid. Their relationship has been very rocky. I angrily told him that they barely talk and it's ridiculous hes blowing me off for her like this. He got angry and said it's still his mother. I continued to cry and be angry. I told him I'd come there but he was already mad about me lashing out at his mother and said he didn't want that.

Now things are strained. Im extremely upset, I have finals coming up, and I haven't eaten all day from the stress of this. I don't have the focus to study for my exams, I desperately need to pass my calculus class to get into Statistics next semester, and I just feel like Im falling the fuck apart.

Am I being irrational? Please give me some advice. I am sitting here bawling my eyes out and biting my nails into oblivion. I feel as if I should approach him again tomorrow when we've cooled off but Im still angry and resentful he chose his neglectful mother over me.

11487,Relationships,1n1oid,"Sorry for the length. I've been dating my boyfriend for a little over 3 years. I love him very much, but recently I've found myself at a crossroad. Let me emphasize that nothing is inherently wrong with our relationship. We get in the occasional fight but nothing major. I tend to be more outgoing and motivated while he has trouble focusing on goals. He's very laid back and doesn't let hardly anything bother while I tend to have to have things a certain way. Sometimes I feel he's exactly what I need. Other times though I can't help but wonder if I can find someone better fit for me. I think about this a lot and have done so for a while. He is an introvert and I'm more extroverted. This has been somewhat of a problem throughout our relationship, but more so lately. I've been going through some depressed episodes, partially what I believe is due to a new birth control. I've become emotionally dependent on him and have trouble being alone. Usually my SO will want to leave or have time to himself, but I just start crying and get really upset. These episodes last for about an hour and usually he'll just watch tv with me until it passes and I'll be fine for the most part. I know this isn't fair to him and the whole time while I'm crying all I can think about is how pathetic I am and how he'll eventually get tired of me and leave for good. I tell him this and he says he's not going anywhere. I know this isn't normal and I have scheduled an appointment to see a therapist.


However, this is where I'm stuck. I like to go out, drink with friends, dance, etc. but my SO just doesn't find it very appealing. He understands though and doesn't mind if I go and dance with guys and have a good time. The other night I went out with a friend and her boyfriend while my boyfriend went to a LOL tournament. I met this really cool guy. We ended up talking for a couple of hours. He said he was really into me but I told him I had a boyfriend of 3 years. He tried to kiss me once (I didn't let him), but other than that nothing happened. Since then, I find myself thinking about him and this has really made me question my already shaky stance on my relationship. I'm in college now and while a lot of girls are figuring out what they like in a partner, I've been with one person for 3 years. I would hate to graduate and then figure out that me and my boyfriend are not right for each other, plus I feel the longer I'm with him the more painful it will be to break up with him (if we break up). I'm not thinking of leaving my boyfriend for this random guy but it has got me thinking: Are me and my SO compatible? Do I leave my safe relationship to possibly find someone else that might be a better fit? Even if I decided it's time to leave him I'm not sure if I even could because I do love and deeply care about him.

The winter dance is coming up on Saturday, and it's a girls-ask-guys thing. My girlfriend asked me today, which I knew was going to happen, just not how or when. HOWEVER, one of our mutual friends, we'll call her Sarah, told me a few days ago that my girlfriend had mentioned Sarah should ask me to see what I would say, if I would go to the dance with someone other than her.

Now, again, I'm outgoing, and that goes equally for girls and guys. Not flirting, but just chatting, teasing, like friends do. Apparently, my girlfriend was conspiring with Sarah to temp me into infidelity, thinking that I'm too nice to say no to a dance proposal...

Obviously, I wouldn't say yes, especially because both Sarah and I know that my girlfriend is going to ask me.

11490,Relationships,22izmg,"Background: My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years now. We have a fantastic relationship, and are both very hardworking people. We’re triple majors, bookworms, and want to be lawyers. We’re both happy to have found someone so similar, and love each other very much. We both plan on getting married in the next few years or so.



Of course, since my boyfriend is a year ahead of me, he’s attending law school first. He not only did amazingly on the lsat, but is going to be attending an ivy league school about five hours away from where I am in the fall on a full scholarship. I’m insanely proud of him, and of course, he’s over the moon about it. I always knew he could do something like this.



I’ve always known being apart for a year was inevitable, because math. But, I’m the kind of person who is obsessed with planning. It’s always been in my nature. I have lists on lists, color-coding, routines, sublists, backup lists, calendars, etc. Planning and organization is what calms me down, and although people think it’s crazy, it makes me very happy.



So, my boyfriend being in a different place than me, and me being unable to plan, is putting a huge wrench in things. Of course, I’m excited for him, but worried about the future, which I unfortunately cannot plan for. Since I’m a year below him and haven’t taken the lsat yet, I can’t even plan where I’m going to end up being, no matter how hard I try, because it’s pretty much impossible. He’s all set with things, but I still have exams, two more semesters, a thesis, the lsat, letters of recommendations, the waiting game, negotiating scholarships, etc. Meanwhile, most of my friends on campus have graduated or are also graduating this year.



Unfortunately, all of this is upsetting my boyfriend. He feels like I’m not proud or excited for him, when I really am. It’s just that I feel like he doesn’t get that while he’s able to enjoy the fruits of his labor, I’m in that shitty place of high stress that he was in at this time last year, while now he’s “done” and can sit back until the fall. While I’m super proud of him, *I* still have no idea what will happen to me, and the end is not yet in sight. For me, it’s tough to think about his success and not get a sense of anxiety about the future, because things aren’t yet settled and it’s tough to separate the two. And, of course, being a bit (probably, still figuring it out and dislike throwing around labels) OCD, the idea of adjusting to so many new things is both tough and kind of terrifying. 



So, how can I balance my own anxiety, stress, and uncertainty, and still have my boyfriend feel like I’m proud and excited for him? Or is it okay that I feel this way and is it okay if I express it? Does anyone have any experience with this type of thing? I feel like whenever I've expressed this, that he's reacted as if I'm bringing him down from something he's worked so hard for and has reason to be happy about, and like I'm being whiny, which in turn makes me really mad inside because I was along with him for this entire ride and am still on it myself. Only a crazy person would not be happy about these things, but on the same note, only a crazy person would not be stressed out about their own situation.

I was dating this girl and it was going exceptionally well for about 6 months, just mutually head over heels, until we started living in different cities and had to break up due to a lack of contact. I was also secretly suspicious of infidelity, and I never really found out why she changed her mind about the whole thing.

This was devastating to me because she had already had me thinking we would be getting married just as soon as we could and eventually have kids too (it really was exceptional for those 6 months). After some failed attempts at staying in touch platonically, I decided the only way to get over her would be to cut her out and end all communication, so I did.

I still feel this way and could not ask for better.

He's single but looking pretty hard for a girlfriend and spends a lot of time on dating sites. But, he's pretty picky and doesn't have too much luck for reasons I don't really understand. We're fairly similar and spend a lot of time talking and hanging out. 

I enjoy spending time with him and I believe he enjoys spending time with me as well, although I'm unsure of the scope of his feelings or if he has any kind of attraction towards me. (I almost considered posting this in personal issues)

These feelings aren't so strong that it's difficult to interact with him but my boyfriend wants to keep living with him for the foreseeable future so I'd like to deal with this personally now rather than later.

Also, just to reiterate, this hasn't changed my feelings towards my boyfriend. However it has made me feel a lot of conflicting things; guilt, excitement, confusion and even a little more confident.

I do not think anything that's crossing the line will happen here as this guy isn't exactly the impulsive type. Also, I couldn't see myself actually ever going through with anything. I have a distracted imagination but that's where it ends.

I go to sleep around midnight and he goes to bed around the same time, usually earlier since he needs to get up close to 6am for his commute.

He said we were going to have a nice weekend together just him and I this weekend but his friend is having this big house party and he wants to go.  I don't and I probably won't.  If I don't go I will see friends which is great but it doesn't fix the fact that him and I don't see each other.

He really liked me, but I used him and told enough lies that he, understandably, lost all respect. I can't even figure out why I treated him so badly when he was nothing but good to me. I'd do anything to have him back and do things right this time. I tried apologizing, for three whole months in fact. But between all the crying, the countless I'm sorrys, and the letter I wrote, I'm sure he now sees the girl he once thought was beautiful as nothing more than a weak, desperate mess. And last we spoke he told me he wants to move on.

This guy never leaves my mind, no matter where I am or what I'm doing; even slips into my dreams quite often.

All I had to do was remind myself of the times they'd treated me wrong, and tell myself I deserved better. But this time it was my fault that everything fell apart. I made someone (who didn't deserve it at all) feel horrible and betrayed. All I want to do right now is hold him and make everything right but I can't, he's lost all trust in me. 

He was perfect. He works hard, always willing to help others out (never even asking for help himself), open about everything, incredibly intelligent, easy on the eyes. What was I even thinking? My friends who had only met him once or twice always told me they thought he was lame, and that I could do better, but they were completely wrong, had never even talked to him, and I don't know why I even let that get to me. He was a nice, genuine guy. I was so wrong to take him for granted. How do I get over this guy? People keep telling me to take it as a lesson learned the hard way and do better in new relationships in the future. But I wish I could take it could be a lesson learned, and do better with him in the future. I find myself completely uninterested in anyone else.

TL/DR- My ex was a great guy but I was a dick and we broke up. I tried apologizing for 3 whole months, to no avail. How do I get over him now?

11499,Relationships,1uhydx,"I [19F] have been seeing my boyfriend [20M] for a little over a year now. Our relationship has developed very well and I can see us staying together for a very long time. I was in a relationship for 4 years before this one and I can honestly say that I love my current boyfriend in a way that I have never experienced. Really, he's everything that I ever could have asked for.

The problem lies in the fact that his mother is horrible. I mean, she's a generally nice person but she's a horrible mother. She's recently married this man who never wanted children. He's constantly being an asshole to my boyfriend and his two sisters [17 and 23]. He frequently expresses contempt for them and their liberal views. My boyfriend's not even liberal... To top it off, he's constantly reminding them that the house is his property, they're simply residing in it. I can understand it to an extent but he's set up cameras to monitor them and has even gone so far as to prevent them from decorating their rooms. He has a painting of a cat hanging over my boyfriend's bed. It's weird.

Anyway, my boyfriend's kind of stuck living at home now. He was at college for a year but ran out of funds (he's expected to pay his tuition completely) and had to move back in with his mother. He is expected to hold a full time job while he's at home and is not allowed to commute to school, even though it would save him so much money. The problem is, he's unable to save enough to move out and go back to school as she expects him to routinely feed both himself and his younger sister (they don't keep food in the house and she usually has dinner with her husband without them). Plus, she found him searching for apartments the other day and freaked out.

I guess this is coming off as being a bit ranty, I'm just trying to give an idea of how this woman is. Pretty much, my problem lies in the fact that she's pulling this whole throw my child into the pool and force him to swim act but she's not allowing him any freedom. She's become increasingly strict in everything that he does. He's not allowed to have anybody, including his older sister, visit. He's not allowed to go out unless he's working, essentially. She let's him go out to eat with me on occasion but he's absolutely not allowed back at my house. Really, she clearly doesn't take us seriously as a couple and is putting a real strain on our relationship. This was never a problem when he was attending school. He spent half his time with me over breaks, we went on trips, etc. 

The worst part is, whenever he tells her that he'd like to do something with me, she acts as if I'm a horrible girlfriend who is demanding all of his attention. She literally told him that he's been too nice to me and that any disappointment that I might feel is his fault for letting me get so comfortable.

Reddit, I'm going crazy. I can't stand the way that she and her husband treat her kids and I'm deeply hurt by her refusal to accept that I have a relationship with her son. I fantasize about storming into their house and telling her off. I just don't know what to do.

11500,Relationships,27wrdv,"My boyfriend separated from his wife about half a year ago and has since started seeing me.  He is in the process of filing for a divorce but has been afraid about how she is going to react so he has been postponing filing paperwork on his own trying to wait until she agrees to file a co-petition.

They have two kids together.  And they work together. She yells at him a lot when they are at work together

She is fully aware he wants a divorce and does not want to reconcile.  He turned down couple's counseling.

I suspect she was somewhat abusive in the relationship.  I know for sure that she has physically struck him on numerous occasions (he's a big muscular man so I think he just tries to brush it off).  I suspect there was quite a bit of emotional abuse as well, but he is a sweet man and does not want to villainize her in any way so he has been hesitant to admit it. He just wants out.

She started meeting with a counselor on her own.  She convinced him to meet with the counselor, telling him it would just be him and the counselor. We thought maybe the counselor was just wanting to get his perspective to may help explain it to her.

Instead, it was the counselor, him, and his wife.  And the counselor let her yell at him for a while, while the counselor scolded him.  The counselor was saying that he is hurting the kids by leaving her, that he was hurting her.  That he should break up with me because he doesn't know himself well enough to be in a stable relationship with someone new. (He has a wonderful relationship with his kids and the older one actually has a not-so-great relationship with her mom).

I am a little shocked that someone who calls themselves a counselor would allow someone to be a punching bag for an entire session and then also gang up on them.

He feels like he deserves to be treated this way because he hurt her by leaving and I have urged him to speak with a neutral party (a therapist maybe) to see that he does not deserve this.  That ending a relationship does not grant the party that was left to freely abuse the leaving party. It is breaking him and making him feel so guilty.

Is this unusual behavior for a counselor? How can I let him see that he does not deserve this?

I'm an American who moved to Hong Kong back in 2008. In 2009, I met a woman who would change every aspect of my life. I'll name her Jane for the sake of privacy. We instantly took a liking to one another and even though I'm Black, she never cared what everyone thought or said about us. Jane still is an incredibly smart, sexy, and highly sophisticated.

After much thought, I decided to leave Hong Kong during Christmas 2011. She hated the thought of me leaving, but she knew I wanted to be more. I left because I wanted to be more for her. Jane was receiving promotions at her job while her man wasn't. That didn't sit well with me. I wanted to continue to impress her and be her champion.

She came back with me to meet my family. They. ate. her. up. There were days when I would wake up alone because my family would kidnap her on some days and take her around town just for the hell of it.

Holiday ended and she had to go. It was our first painful goodbye. I dropped her off at Hartsfield-Jackson ATL airport. Weeks later, I decided to go back to Asia to stay near her. Our reunion was beautiful.

Stupidity got the best of me and From 2012-2013, I left HK for Shanghai and Tokyo for work. We stayed together and flew back and forth to see each other. She was always there for me. Always strong.
Once my time in Japan ended, I went back to HK for 2 weeks to decide on my future. My family relationship was in dire need of repair and I wanted to prove to them that I could succeed in the U.S. She took me to the airport for a very painful 4th time.

I moved back to the U.S. and took a job in NYC. Jane and I stayed in a relationship throughout this time, even coming to visit me during Christmas. That's when I realized how much time I gave up while being away from my heart.

We broke up in March. I felt I wasn't good enough. She deserved stability. Not a long distance relationship with someone who she felt had a rocky future. I wanted her, but I knew she was tired. She later told me she felt relieved when we broke up. I decided to moved back to HK at the end of my contract. I didn't tell her. I should have. While I missed her, she worked extremely hard to get over me.

I secretly flew back Sept 15 and surprised her that night at her apt. I was scared out of my mind and she was shocked to see me. Her mouth would move with no words coming out. My overall demeanor didn't help the situation. I was scared out of my mind, heart about to jump out of My chest. When I saw her expression, my face immediately dropped. Let me fast forward this story a bit.

Month 1: Dialogue was incredibly painful. She told me she went to L.A. for a festival(she works in music) while i was in NYC, spent two weeks there, with no desire to tell me. She had also given herself to other men during her time as a newly single woman as well. Understandable. People have needs. Even her dating life has improved. I met other women. They all sucked and regret even trying in the first place.

She was mad at me for expecting her to just jump in my arms. She told me that I don't have a plan B for my life, finishing a job and going to the next one. She was wrong on both counts. I knew it would be difficult and I do have a plan. Unfortunately, I just haven't shown it to her.

Month 2: fared much better. Trips to the cinema, few sunday dinners with her family and even a nice picnic for two at the waterfront. We also had a few setbacks. She has told me that since I've been here(two months), she's had no desire to even kiss me or be with someone who she feels has no plan. You want to talk about crushing a person, Scorpios do it best. :)

We just had thanksgiving dinner the other night where she proceeded to talk the entire time with other people, in Cantonese, as i sat there keeping a smile. She kept me at a distance.

Last night, i saw her with a guy who she apparently has known longer than me. She told me he's a friend who is married with a child coming. She and the guy explained that to me, but it just all felt so wrong. Tonight(my Saturday), we went to a music festival. She told me she met someone the day before I arrived. She likes him. They've had sex while I've been here, and she finds herself more connected with his energy than mine. She also likes the fact that he's around her age. 4 years isn't a difference with me. She had a very satisfied look on her face after telling me.

So here I am, Reddit. Tear me apart. Don't hold back. Tell me how big of an idiot I was for leaving. Tell me everything I need to hear. What should I do? Has anyone on here been in my shoes?

11506,Relationships,2f0r9t,"My husband and I got married less than a year ago but we’ve been together for nearly 4. I graduated recently and am weeks away from beginning my first career job. He is completing his own degree part-time while working, we are in similar fields in terms of workload and academic expectations.


Last semeseter he needed an extension in a class to finish the final project. We were just about to get married, so I understood why he felt so overwhelmed. We agreed that he could focus on our wedding and after that finish up his project (his professor doesn’t care and knows my husband well, so no pressure there). Since I no longer had school myself I volunteered to do all of the cooking and cleaning around the house so he could just focus on summer courses and this project.


Summer school comes and goes, and he aced his classes but he still hasn’t finished his project. I spent so much of my summer (a summer that was ostensibly my last “school’s out” type summer before I got this job) cleaning, working, and generally being more of a support network than anything else. At this point I have gotten really resentful, because I thought his project would have been done by now but instead it’s barely been worked on. His classes were both easy A classes, and we had talked about how he needed to prioritize this course that was already late and a notoriously hard class over his classes he basically had to show up for. Anytime I brought up his project he got really defensive and snapped at me, so I tried to not bring it up at all.



Things came to a head the week after summer school, because we were supposed to have 2 weeks where we would go back to splitting housework and that wouldn’t be happening anymore because he hadn’t finished his project. I ended up having a complete breakdown, begging him to finish it so I can have some time off and we can have some time as a couple before the next school year starts. I also told him how unfair it was that he would get mad at me for reminding him to work on this project when over the summer he said that me helping him remember his summer course deadlines helped. He seemed genuinely apologetic, and I felt like I had finally driven home that this project was really negatively effecting our relationship. I asked if there was anything I was doing that wasn’t helping or anything I could do that could help more, and he said no.


That was a few weeks ago. His project still is not done. I did not get a break, we have had arguments on and off about this stupid thing. He even got very mad at me because the house was a mess and I wasn’t “holding up my end of the deal”. I admit that the house was a mess, but it was a mess because I had decided privately that I would give myself time off and just let it get a little messy and make up for it later because I was at my wit’s end. Every time it comes up we fight. Last time he even said it wasn’t fair of me to get mad because I had to re-take a class twice and was a nervous wreck each time. I had to retake my class because I have a learning disability and an anxiety disorder, and the professor refused to accommodate my learning disability appropriately which caused me to have panic attacks on top of everything. I was furious that he would compare my learning disability to his lack of time management, and he apologized.


He insists he’s working on it as hard as he can. He has had nearly double the time his other classmates got on this project, but it still isn’t done. I am so incredibly emotionally drained at this point. 


This weekend is a 3-day for us, and also the first weekend we have not had unavoidable obligations in 2 weekends. We spent all of last night spending time together and just catching up, it was really nice. We talked about how excited we were to get things done this weekend. He specifically talked about how ready he felt to tackle his project and put a lot of good work into it. We talked about how we needed to be careful to not fall into the trap we usually do where we goof off until Sunday morning and he only works in the afternoon. That this was the weekend to get it done. 


This morning we went and got groceries, and afterward he was supposed to get to work. Well he happens to run into friends outside of the house and they invite us out. He asks if we can go, to which I respond only if we get a lot of work done in the morning. I feel like asking me this put me in a lose-lose situation, because he KNOWS what I want more than anything is him to finish this project but if I say no he’ll be mad because I’m “expecting him to never see friends”. He sulks, then returns 20 minutes later and asks if I want to go upstairs with him and “shower” I admit I snapped a little and said “Really? Right now!?” because we had JUST talked about how he was about to get to work so we could see our friends later. He sulks and leaves. Now I am sitting downstairs quietly fuming that yet again I have to be the bad guy that says no when he’s the one that should be working. 


I am at the end of my rope. I feel like this project should have been done over a month ago. I feel like I shouldn’t have to mother him and force him to work, that he should know to say no to friends and not put me on the spot like that. I feel like I should have gotten this summer to relax, hang out with friends, and maybe do some fun house projects instead of the dishes every goddamn day. I feel like I shouldn’t have to deal with his anger, I feel like he should be BEGGING me to keep doing what I’m doing, not acting like it’s the obvious choice and I’m a selfish bitch to want him to finish his project.


I’m tired of fighting. I’m tired of walking on eggshells. I’m just plain tired. I almost wish this professor wasn’t so fucking lenient because I feel like this would have been done months ago if he hadn’t been. 


What can I do? I feel like I’ve tried everything and all I want is this project to be done and to not be solely responsible for the house. I want a real apology, one that isn’t followed by an angry outburst the next time I ask him to go work. I want him to actually act contrite for longer than a fucking evening. I am past the point where I am being rational about this. Every time I see him doing anything else I just think “you could be doing that fucking project”. It has even been affecting my libido and anxiety. Please help me.

11512,Dating,2bsfo6,"Alright, so my girlfriend and I started dating mid-October nearly three years ago now. I had gotten out of a 6-month relationship that September. There wasn't really a specific time when we started dating; I danced with her at Homecoming, and told her I wanted to take it slow because I had just gotten out of a relationship, and didn't want to make her my rebound. We were just talking a lot at first, then she asked me to see a movie with her family, then I started going to Spanish Club meetings with her. We just kind of slowly started hanging out more and more until it was at the point where we both knew we were in a relationship together.

She's always been insecure; her family is extremely broken. She was born when her mom was 17, and then she married her baby daddy, before getting a divorce a year later. They have both had multiple marriages and divorces, including children in the middle. She currently lives with her mom.

About a year and a half ago, she started having anxiety attacks every so often. Sometimes, we would be hanging out, and something about the future would be brought up (college, marriage, etc.), and she would just stop talking, and be holding back tears. I try talking to her, but she only gives blunt responses, and won't make eye contact with me When this happens, it's hard not to feel like she's mad at me, and it makes me feel pretty shitty. I asked her to go see a therapist, practically begged her. Eventually, she went once and didn't go back. After another anxiety attack earlier this summer, I asked her to start going again, and she said she would, but she hasn't.

My parents are very scared that she is hurting me and herself. They very much want us to break up, to the point where I pretty much can't bring her up around them for fear of it starting another dragged out talk about how she isn't good for me, and why we need to break up. My girlfriend sees this and is very mad at them. She thinks that they hate her.

We went on a one-month long break from the beginning of December until New Year's 2014. It happened after we were talking, and got on the subject of marriage. She said how she wanted to get married literally as soon as possible. I said that I wanted to wait until I had a financially stable job, and was sure that my financial situation would not be a hinderance to the marriage. She just kind of stopped talking, and I told her that she can't keep doing this. She has her own stuff that she needs to work through, her own depression/anxiety/whatever the hell it is, and as much as I wanted to be with her, she needs to sort it out.

It seemed better right after the break, but it started to slip back to the way it had been shortly afterwards.

She's a very smart girl. She was one of two at her graduation to receive a gold cord (basically, she got really good ACT scores and had a good GPA.) She was going to CC while I was finishing up my last year of high school. And when I found a college that I wanted to go to (one that she had looked at, but decided against), she wanted to go there too.

It's a private college, and pretty expensive, although it has a lot to offer in terms of scholarships. She would have to take out quite a few loans. It doesn't have the entire program she wants to graduate with, but most of it. She would have to go to a graduate school. At first, I told her that I was fine with her going to this college with me, but after really thinking about it, it started to feel more and more like she was just wanting to follow me to college so that she doesn't have to lose me. I told her all of this, and she was pissed. I told her that I could be the one to not go to this college, and she could go instead (even though this school was the only one I could find that had the exact program I wanted to get into). She said she didn't want to take it away from me, and would find some where else. 

She was offered a scholarship to go to England for school, some where she has wanted to go for a very long time. She was almost entirely ready to do this, when her mom told her that it would be far too expensive, and she didn't want to take out all of the loans that she would have to.

She has now found a college ~45 minutes away from the school I am going to, and is trying desperately to get into it in time for this year. Granted, it will be nearly free for her with the amount of scholarships (one of which is a freshman scholarship, which she will only be eligible for this year) she'll be getting, and probably a very good experience for her. But I can't help but feel uncomfortable. When it didn't look like her high school had sent in her transcripts in time, she cried to me and told me how unfair it was that the colleges she had wanted to go to were ripped away from her, and why she can't understand how no one can believe that she wanted to go to the school that I am going to for her own reasons. Yesterday, she found out that this college did finally receive the transcripts, and she will be able to go. I don't want to have to take this away from her too, but at the same point, it feels like she's not doing this for her; she's doing it so that we can stay together.

I don't want to make it seem like we're never happy together. We're mostly very happy together. We do all sorts of stupid stuff, have fun, we both share some of the same interests (video games, nerdy shit), and I truly do love her. I could picture myself marrying her, if everything goes right. When she's happy, everything is great, but she has a lot of her own stuff she needs to work through.

**tl;dr**: I'm scared that I'm sort of enabling my girlfriend to not make her own decisions, but rather to coast through life, never really living up to her potential. And it's not only hurting her, it's choke-holding me as well. I guess my question is, should I break up with her?","I [18 M] have been with my girlfriend [19 F] for almost 3 years, she's emotionally draining, somewhat unstable, and it's starting to drag me down.",0.0,False,0.0,0.0,1406393612.0,/r/relationships/comments/2bsfo6/i_18_m_have_been_with_my_girlfriend_19_f_for/,Romantic

I don't want their pity. I don't want people to look at me and wish they could help me - that is embarrassing. They don't need to do that, because I like to think of myself as strong. Feeling weak is embarrassing. 

So it appears that I have found someone who doesn't know how to express their feelings just as much as I do. We have been hooking up for about 4 months, and recently feelings have entered the picture. I have lately been constantly confused. He will act like he likes me when he is around me, but will rarely contact me via telephone. SO many times when I have slept over, the next morning I will sit up and look at him, determined that I will finally ask him how he feels about me, are we exclusive, and what does he want? But when I look at him and he looks at me, fear runs through me. The thought of opening up to him scares me. Feeling vulnerable makes me so uncomfortable. I don't know how to shake it.


Texting is easy. Texting what I feel doesn't scare me, because I can't see him. He can't see in my eyes what I'm feeling. But texting your feelings is incredibly immature and stupid. I realize this, and it makes me even more upset that I can't bring myself to open up to him.


He is awful at everything girls. He doesn't get that him not speaking to me for like two days upsets me. He doesn't understand why I uninvited him to my friend's wedding. He doesn't understand what I've been feeling. He is getting upset, he is getting annoyed, he is confused. To me, it is so fucking simple. Act like you care, talk to me, and we will be okay. But he doesn't understand, because he doesn't normally date girls (according to him). He likes me. I know he does. How we were in the beginning and how we are now is very different (we are very affectionate when together). 

I don't know how to comfortably tell him how I feel. I don't know how to not be frightened when I do it. I don't know what to do. I like him a lot. I feel like me being upset with him, and him having no idea why, is ruining things. But on the other hand, how could it possibly be that hard to understand what he needs to do to make me happy?

11514,Breakups,1k2mnt,"Hi everyone,


So, on August 4th my girlfriend of 4 years and 6 months broke up with me for another guy. I'll give you the details.



My ex-girlfriend  (we’ll call her “A) and I met in college and have been together since that time. She is my first love. We went through a lot of good times and bad times together, particularly in the first two years. She had to deal with the heartache of my depression and it ultimately ended up creating anxiety and stress for her, which I tried to help her manage. I struggled at the very beginning to have feelings for her (and constantly questioned myself) because my heart had been shut down for so many years due to family problems and the emotional trauma in being bullied most of my life. After about three years in we both got help in therapy and got on medication.



Since those times of severe strain, things got much better. We no longer argued, were restless or had major issues. After we graduated I moved with her to Minnesota (we went to school in Wisconsin; I’m originally from North Carolina). Her parents helped me get settled in, I got an apartment and eventually a job with the local police department. Things were good…except for distance. Although we only lived about 15 minutes away, I had no car (now I'm just getting one next week thanks to her dad; a shame I can't enjoy it now though). I ended up working days when she didn’t work and she worked days when I didn’t. I got a bit caught up in being isolated at home and didn’t contact her as much as I should have…



The issue of course is this new guy; we’ll call him “D.” A went with her parents to Japan as a gift for her high school graduation, where she met D. Apparently some sort of special connection was created at that time and never left her. During college this guy actually got in contact with her on Facebook, which freaked A out…it was too depressing (because she tried to “forget him”). He would randomly initiate contact for a few days, cease contact for 6 months, come back again…and so on. 



About three weeks ago they got in touch with one another again online…she started texting him a lot. Then she told me that she wanted to fly out to see him in order to see if she should be with him. Her connection over five years with him never died out. I told her that I wouldn’t like it, but would not protest because she was an adult and could make her own decisions (I felt this way despite her telling me that she might “resent” me for it if she wasn’t able to go). 
About a week and a half ago she left for an entire week to see him…in PA. I was anxious the entire time, especially since she barely had any contact with me once she got there. They went up to Delaware and went to the beach, watched movies, hung out, etc…



When A got back I went to her house, went upstairs and into her bedroom where she was laying down. I laid down next to her and talked a little bit before asking her, “So what did you decide? You want to be with him, don’t you?” She shook her head yes. 



I was devastated of course (and still am, five days later). She told me that our relationship didn’t end because of me. She couldn’t “explain it,” but there was something about D that swayed her. Apparently he’s just like me: a really nice, caring guy. She did mention that she and I never went through our “honeymoon” phase, so that probably had something to do with it (from what I’ve read though, most of that is fiction and based on TV romance; rarely are both persons infatuated with one another early on). 



So now I’m at an impasse. I’m trying to decide if I should compete with this guy, who’s far away, or if I should just “let her be” and get on with my life. I asked her if there was any chance that we would be able to get back together. She said that it was likely, since she doesn’t know if she can handle a long-distance relationship. 



I’ve been reading on forums looking for suggestions and many people tend to quote the phrase, “If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were.” I’ve been thinking about it a lot…this is the exact reason I let her go see D, because I didn’t want to force her to stay against her will. I even told her that today through a text. I said that I let her go because I loved her (and still do). 



The other issue is that I think I should compete for her heart, because it shows just how much I care. My worry though is that this will push her further away from me, especially at the early stage of where she is fawning over the guy. She’s planning on leaving Minnesota after she gets her graduate degree in a year and a half. She doesn’t like the weather here and she wants to be with him. 



Since Sunday I’ve been in contact with her like I’ve always been, save for much face-to-face (she has to work and we’ve decided to only see each other once a week, even though I hate it). I’ve told her how much I care for her and if she still wanted to see me, or if she wanted me to get out of her life. She doesn’t want me to be alone…she still wants to talk and see me. 



This woman is the first person in my life whom I’ve truly treasured. She fixed me when I was emotionally broken and taught me how to love. She’s cute, funny, beautiful, intelligent, sarcastic, adorable and amazing in many respects. I told her that I would never find another person like her (and that I know deep in my heart that I won’t) and that I didn’t want to lose her. 



So yeah…what the hell should I do? Should I continue talking with and seeing her like I always have (obviously can’t be intimate with her anymore) or would it be best to keep a distance and let things run its course? I don’t want to be lonely…she was an immense part of my life and was really the drive to keep me going and happy. She was a huge support system for me. I’ve no friends and am pretty much isolated every day in my small apartment each day I come home from work. At the same time, she shouldn’t have to deal with me…I told her that I wanted her to be happy, and if this guy can fulfill what I couldn’t bring to the table then that would make me content. I told her that I didn’t hate either her nor him for what’s happened…it was probably an occurrence of fate. 



Flirt and compete or keep a distance and move on? I told a co-worker about all this and he thinks I should just move on. A’s mom thinks that I should move on with my life as well, because A is so infatuated with this guy. She said that I shouldn’t put my life on hold while waiting for her (if she ever decides to come back). The nice thing though is that A is very honest and straightforward. She cares a lot about me...said she didn't want to string me along or lead me on, so there's no issue there. I also texted her that I took her for granted...that I got complacent in thinking that she would always be mine. I guess you really never truly appreciate something until it's gone.

11515,Infidelity,35eree,"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for about a month, exclusively for a week. Before dating were friends for over a year. He has always expressed interest in more but I was involved with someone else. 

He would tell me that he's never felt so close to a girl and he can tell me anything, and that he'd marry me tomorrow if I wanted to but would always support who I wanted to be with. I've never felt so reassured and beautiful than I do when he speaks about me. We finally got together and it feels like the strongest most mature relationship. I haven't been worried about any aspect of it. 

He is the tour manager and best friends with a rock band full of guys in their late twenties, who are very attractive, newly successful, and regularly sleep with random women (almost nightly). None of the band members have been in a relationship for over a year. My boyfriend has had a couple of girlfriends in the last few years and rarely has one night stands. They are currently all on tour for about a month.

His friends have been giving him a hard time about our relationship but that's to be expected. I'm friends with all of them too, and I want him to stay close with them. Last night he went out with the band and drank a ton, and was talking/flirting with girls they met at a bar. 

We've talked about harmless flirting now that we've decided to be exclusive. We're both very non-jealous people are confident in our relationship and trust each other. We also both work in fields that require some degree of it (I'm a bartender). However, he claims a girl he met tried to kiss him, and he pulled away and told her he had a girlfriend. His story seemed muddled, I'm not sure if he entertained the idea at all and they made out for a bit or what. I just don't see how it could get to that point. I don't think I would flirt so much that the other party would try to kiss me, at least so far it hasn't happened. I get hit on a lot and definitely do my share of flirting but it hasn't been physical.

He called me immediately after and said what happened. I was blind sighted as I've never trusted someone so much before and didn't see this coming so early into our relationship. I cried on the phone and told him I believe him but I just didn't know what to say. We haven't talked since last night. Should I be upset? Do I need to do or say anything when we speak about it later today? 

I think this is just opening up some larger insecurities I have myself from past relationships. I've had a lot of guys tell me they're in love, only want me, etc., but for their actions to say otherwise. I don't want to be a fool, I'm super young and romantic and I can get wrapped up in love quickly. I thought our relationship was so strong infidelity would never be on the table, even with both of our nighttime lifestyles, but now I'm questioning my blind trust in him.

However, my longest relationship was only about 3-4 months. Even very open, casual sexual relationships with people only really last 2-3 months with me. I feel like the problem is that I'm always identifying why the relationship wouldn't work out in the long term. I don't stop dating/sleeping with them right away, because I still enjoy being around them, but eventually it comes to a point where one of us breaks it off. It's about a 50-50 split between myself and the girl who decides to break it off first.

Recently, I've gone on a couple dates with a girl (who I have no idea how old she is, sorry. Near my age anyway.) and I feel a pretty strong connection. We share a lot of the same interests, she's very laid back, open, she's honest about her sexuality, and she seems to be really into me. For example, my birthday is coming up in a week, and she asked what my plans were. When I said she didn't have any, she started suggesting how we could spend the day together doing my favorite things and she'd treat me.

It was incredibly sweet of her and I really do appreciate the thought, but I also felt an instinctive pull away from her. I'm already planning on seeing her this weekend and in two weeks for a long weekend. I really do like her, but at the same time, I don't want to get close too quickly. The big problem is that she lives an hour away. Despite all the other great qualities she has, that's really hard for me to handle. I know from experience that I don't do well with LDR and only seeing my SO once a week.

I feel a bit trapped. On one hand, it's not a perfect situation, and I've seen similar situations go badly for me in the past. Cool girls that live far away just don't work for me. On the other hand, I know no relationship is perfect and you have to be willing to work on the things that aren't. 

It's not really just about her. I feel like if things did end with her, I'd just have the same problem all over again with the next girl.

Our situation is a little strange, but I'll do my best to explain. We met when she was 18, and when I was 21. She lived with her Aunt and Uncle, and I lived with a few roommates. Her Aunt and Uncle didn't care for me, and thought I was too old for her, which was understandable, but we didn't see an issue. Six months into the relationship she was put into a position by them, to either leave me, and break all ties with me, or get kicked out. She chose me. She lived with a friend for a short time, but they had her sleeping on their couch in their living room and it was just a bad place to be. I got her out of there, and in with me. We lived together and were happy, but if you've ever lived with someone before, and not been prepared it can cause things to go...not as well as you may have hoped. 

We argued quite a bit, and I couldn't seem to make her happy. She seemed incredibly unhappy, in fact. She was talking about visiting back home, and seeing her mother/sister's whom she'd not seen years, but only for a short time, just to have good family time (She had left them for a more secure house life, which is kind of ironic). Eventually she did, and it was a nearly 3000 mile journey home. I wouldn't be seeing her for months, but she planned on getting a simple serving job, and then returning home.

Communication is the hardest part about a long distance relationship, and I was doing it very poorly. It had been a few weeks, and we couldn't land on the same page, and we were arguing even over the phone/skype/everything. She couldn't find a job, and she wasn't making any money, and it wasn't improving. 
I thought she was never going to come back, and I felt abandoned and I split it off.

I did what a stupid guy with a broken heart does, and I slept with another girl, we'll call her 'A'. Even in the moment it was wrong, and I knew it. I ended the fling with A immediately, and I got a hold of C, and I told her I wanted her back, and I'd do anything to get her to fly back.

I found a way for to come back, and so I did. She was going to stay with my parents. A little unconventional, but hey, we wouldn't have the same problems as before, and we could make it work. She flew back home, she moved in with my parents, and all was well. I thought long and hard about how I was going to tell her about what I had done with this other girl, but I decided to let us settle and get comfortable in the relationship first.

That was the plan, at least. One night, she was on my phone and went through some texts, and found a few short messages between A and I. 

She was devastated. I didn't handle the situation well at all, and was defensive more than anything. HURDUR. It was awful. 

She still decided to stay with me. 

I did everything I could for the next year to make it better. She more or less lived with me, but kept her stuff at my parents house. We were comfy enough to live with each other, but We had our very rough patches, and our very rough arguments, but I knew on the other side of them, we were both trying to make it better. She never got over the cheating though, and it was always with her like a weight. Some days better than others, but whenever we were having a rough time, I knew it's what consumed her mind. 


And now, after being what seemed O.K. for months, with almost no arguing, being what seemed genuinely happy, and having conversations about the future...She ended it. Over the phone. It was completely out of left field for me. We were happy, we were working together literally, I had just gotten her a job with me. Everything was going great, and it just came to the most terrible abrupt halt.

What fucking gives? 
So, I say all of that to get to this. We work in the same restaurant, and she lives with my parents, and I'm totally lost. She doesn't want to speak to me, she doesn't want to be together obviously, and I just need help.

I apologize for length, I apologize for shit formatting, and I apologize if this is sporadic, it's hard to collect my thoughts. If you have any questions, just ask, I'll answer.

Everything was great when she first came back, minus the fact that she said she didn't want to do the whole title thing. Which I was fine with. As long as I had my special lady.

The last few weeks she had been acting very strange. Wasn't responding to my texts as much, barely talking to me, we went from seeing each other almost every day until late in the night to maybe seeing each other once a week. Maybe.

I got suspicious when I found out that she went away for a few days and didn't tell me about it. I had been trying to make plans to go on a vacation with her for the last few months. Late in the night two days ago I woke her up because I couldn't sleep. I asked her if she was seeing someone else. After some hesitation, she said that she was. I asked if they had been having sex and she said yes. I asked her if that is who she went with on her trip, and she said yes. She told me that we are not in a monogamous relationship, we don't technically have a title so it's none of my business. She told me her and this other guy have no future together, but that doesn't make me feel any better that she's sleeping with him and hasn't been sleeping with me.

Literally earlier in the night she was telling me that she always has a great time with me and how we're grown up dating and how great it is we don't need a title to define ourselves.

I guess I can't say that I've been cheated on because we're not official, although I do feel extremely used and like a complete idiot. I treat her like she's my entire world, and most of the time I barely get the time of day back from her. I'm sure she enjoyed getting treated like a princess by me and getting to have great sex with this other dude.

&amp;nbsp;


**Is it acceptable for a guy in a relationship to save nude photos of girls to masturbate to that he knows personally?**  

&amp;nbsp;

-----------
My boyfriend and I are both 25, have been together for almost a year, and live together. We have a loving relationship and a pretty active sex life. 

&amp;nbsp;

My boyfriend masturbates to porn and occasionally dirty pictures of myself that I've sent him. I'm perfectly fine with him looking at porn, he knows that, and we've looked at porn together.
&amp;nbsp;

But I recently found his Dropbox open to a buried folder called girls I know and in it are several subfolders - nude pics of his exes as well as girls he has not dated but has hooked up with/been friends with, organized by name. I recognized some of the names and peeked through them. Most of them had not been modified or uploaded for a couple of years, but I saw several that had been accessed anywhere from a few months ago to a few days ago. None of the recent ones were exes (whew!). From what I know about these girls, he does not cultivate a close friendship with them nor does he see them or interact with them very often.

&amp;nbsp;

After talking with my boyfriend about it, he said he didn't know it would bother me and had he known, he would not have done it. He agrees to no longer do it going forward. As to how he got these photos? He says he did not ask the girls for them, some of them post these nude pictures in personal blogs he follows and/or some non-nudes from their Facebook pages.
He feels that mind and body are separate and that masturbating to photos of girls he knows and porn are the same thing to him - 
he doesn't see it as any form of cheating. 

&amp;nbsp;

I told him I feel it is different, I feel that his desire to save photos of girls he knows does something different for him than just saving pictures of porn and its the something different that makes me feel uneasy. I proposed to him if the situation were vice versa, if I were to seek out nude photos of guys I knew and masturbate to them. He said that he would feel upset, but would forgive me.
I say this is an unspoken rule in a monogamous relationship and I shouldn't have to express that it makes me uncomfortable, he disagrees and feels that the photos and the intention behind them are harmless.

&amp;nbsp;

I feel torn. I feel as though our relationship has been solid and healthy aside from this, but I feel it is a form of cheating and makes me wonder if I can trust him saying that there is nothing more going on than the possession of those photos. My gut tells me to flee, to see this as a red flag. My heart tells me to stay and trust he won't do it again.

I'm not sure how to move forward.

He (my boyfriend) always says really hurtful, sly comments about my weight and he sometimes even acts like a dad figure. 

If I'm off from work and just planning to enjoy the day, he'll say oh so I'm guessing you'll just sit here and eat all day?. Or when I'm eating a lot he'll look at me with disgust and say I think you've had enough now, girl. Or when I'm eating fast he might say woahhhhh slow down. 

Recently he started paying for me to do this Weight Watchers program (and I never asked him to). I do, however, love to go. It's full of positive women at the meetings and we are all really supportive of each other. It inspires me, makes me feel better. However, I haven't gone in a while and he's started saying I'm not going to keep paying for you to refuse to go!. Like I said, I never asked him to pay at all.

It's funny because I was never super skinny when I met him. I will admit that I was 125 (so it is a huge gain), but I never thought he would freak out this much over it.

So, because its much less awkward in texts, I have been complimenting her, flirting with her, etc.  Our relationship has pretty much escalated from friends, to being...  Essentially dating except for the fact that we live hours away from each other.  
 
One time she told me that I've been giving her all these feelings which she thinks might be wrong, of course I told her it was fine and that I had those feelings for her too.  So now during the nighttime she will randomly start role-playing with me (not sexual role-play, but things like *snuggles up against you and kisses your cheek* etc. you know, cute things) but I've also noticed that it is whenever we do these role-plays, usually during points where things are getting a bit more intense, that she suddenly and randomly falls asleep.

Now, either she thinks it is too awkward (which I doubt because she usually starts the more awkward stuff) and starts ignoring me, or she is randomly falling asleep, ooor she has been masturbating to our texts and then falls asleep from the exhaustion.  I've read that all girls masturbate and lie about it, and also that some women will masturbate to help fall asleep.  She was complaining about sleeping issues before we started role-playing, and also has an extremely stressful life thanks to an abusive mother.

Idk if any of this actually adds up, I'm a paranoid person who thinks random stuff all the time, so someone please tell me the likelihood of something like this actually occurring.

Also, I wouldn't judge her if she was.  In fact, I would be happy I help her to relieve stress and sleep each night, I'm just curious about everything and once I've thought of something, I can't stop until I've figured it out.

I've been doing non-sexual role-plays with a friend who is a girl, however we aren't officially dating, but we're essentially a couple.  She has a stressful life and used to have trouble sleeping.  Ever since we started our role-plays she falls asleep randomly during the more romantic parts.

11526,Relationships,1im2lh,"**Background:** I'm 17 years old and a senior in high-school living with my mother. For the most part I try my best to respect my mother's rules but I do admit, I don't listen to her 100% of the time (but that's a complete different issue). I have my own job now with a savings and checking account. I rarely buy things in general, only if I still want the product after a long period of waiting on it.

_______________________________________________


**Story:** So I have been eyeing a big purchase on Amazon for a while now, around ~$500 which is a 3DS XL with games if that matters. I have worked enough and saved enough money to be able to purchase it and have some money left overs and still put money into my savings account. Since I have a debit, I decided to go ahead and order the products on Amazon in my name with my own money without telling her.

 So my stuff comes in and I tell my mom what I ordered because I couldn't hide it at this point. She freaked out. She absolutely detested the thought of me spending money on video games, constantly saying that I should have bought something better and something that I would have enjoyed after working my first job.

She always tells me to spend my money on something better, but the person she is, I know that she means I'm not to spend any money at all whether it be mine or hers.

So after my first shipment (Amazon sent me 3 packages at different times), I let her know that I have another package coming in a few days because I will be gone at a football team camp for the next few days. This time, she absolutely loses it. Yelling at me for spending more money, I tried to tell her that I only spent money on one order and I have been planning that order for a long time now. She exclaims why do I work if you're just going to spend money like it's nothing saying how hard she works to buy me a car and to pay the bills and how I just spend money on video games. 

Don't get me wrong here, I appreciate the fact that she provides for her and I, and is 'trying' to buy a car so that I could have the old one. There is no way we are able to afford a car for her and insurance for me in our current financial situation. On top of the fact that she wants a brand new Honda Pilot for herself, there is just no way. I have never asked for a car and told her I have absolutely no problem in not having one, but she still wants to buy one so she can have the new one since our current car is getting pretty old.

So, she is now trying to put a lock on my account so that I can't spend money (I have nothing else on my list at this point) and is furious at me.

**I just don't understand why I am not allowed to spend my own money that I worked my ass off for. My job isn't easy and I would like to buy the things I want after making sure I really want them. I generally am a frugal person unless it is something I have been eyeing for an extended period of time. Am I in the wrong? She is my mother and I do try my best to do what she thinks is best for me, but there are things that I just flat out disagree with her on such as this issue. Reddit, please help and give me advice, I don't want to see my mom so mad over something like this.**

_________________________________________________

**More rant because I am pretty ticked off and I've been wanting this off my chest for so long:** I'm in high-school, make decent grades, in the IB program, and am on several sports teams. My mom is from Korea, has had a bad relationship with my father (she claims he ruined her life by bringing her to America) and has always been a poorer person. She works a physically taxing job as a server for banquets and constantly complains of her body pain, most likely due to her fibromyalgia. I do work the same job as her. 

My mom absolutely hates computers because: 1) she does not understand them, and 2) my dad was always had no money and was constantly on the computer and viewed porn. 

I would consider her a *Jesus freak*  while I am a closet agnostic. She always tries to force her religion onto me, and I can understand why, she fully believes in her religion and doesn't want her child to go to hell. She doesn't speak great English and my Korean is not the best either. It makes it hard to communicate sometimes but we try our best. 

As much as I hate to say it, I do consider her a stupid person who simply repeats to me what all her friends tell her, and I do lose my patience quite a bit with her when trying to explains things she doesn't understand. She constantly blames the problems on the computer or my father or me playing video games when she simply doesn't understand why the problems exist or anything she blames them on. 

I do admit, I play a lot of video games, they are the main thing I do besides school and football. But they're what give me the most enjoyment of my life so far, so I play them. 

I love her as my mother, but I feel as if I would strongly dislike her as a person. She tells me that I'm her life as in, she has nothing in her life except raising me to be an adult. Because of this, she exerts a lot of pressure  on me to do well in life. She always tells me things like stop cracking your bones or else you'll get arthritis, and I'll tell her that that is not true. Or she will tell me something else to which I respond Don't worry mom, I'm not stupid. She always tells me that she won't be able to pay for college, and I understand that, I don't expect anything from either of my parents, just stop bringing it up because *I know that*. Like a lot of things my mom tells me, I just want to respond *I know that, please don't tell me again.* But I don't because I know she tells me these things because she wants to raise me right and she is my mother.

 I hate when my mom brings up my dad because she has nothing good to say about him and I don't want to hear her constantly bad talk my dad. From what I've seen before the separation,  my mom constantly drinks because she is frustrated at having no money and instigates a fight. She put my dad through a lot from what I've seen. I feel sorry for my dad and I respect him and regret how I treated him when I was in 7th grade (I was such a little shit head). Despite what my mom put my dad through, he still sends her money on top of child support, even sent her that money when I was living with him, has not divorced her so she can receive health care benefits, etc. Yet she has nothing good to say about him. I am glad they parted ways. 

I mostly keep to myself in the house, on the computer. I'm not a very outgoing person, due to the fact that my mom does not want me out late at night which is when everybody is doing something, and I do not like to be around a lot of people due to the fact that all they want to do is get drunk and party or something. So as a result, I just keep to myself at home. 

We're not the richest, nor the poorest. I am happy with what we have, I can't ask for more because I can live happily. My mom can't. She always wants more. I don't know how she can live her life always not happy, she is never satisfied with anything. I try to tell her to just enjoy life as it is, but she has to bring something up that is always wrong. 

She used to have a drinking problem but has stepped past that. The fights she would instigate would be so ridiculous that I would just have to refuse to talk to her and ask to go to my dad's. I go to my dad's to just get away from her because I was tired of the shit she pulled, and she still begs for me to comeback to live with her. When she is mad, she thinks she won't care if I'm not there which is false because many times she has begged me to come back. I know I could care less if I didn't live with her, but at the same time, I know she can't handle when I'm gone. It's only because she put everything into raising me, which I do appreciate.

In the end, I do love her as my mother and would be devastated if something happened to her. I do have my issues though.

**TLDR: Wow this rant was huge, and I've never ranted like this, but it feels so relieving to get it off for once. The tldr is the big bolded part in the story section. Also, I will be gone for the next few days because I'll be at a football team camp, but when I get back, I'm going to read all the responses. Thank you.**

11527,Relationships,2dd0f3,"My boyfriend and I have been dating since early November, exclusively since mid-February (that's 9 and 6 months for those who don't want to count).  I have been living at home since September, saving up money for grad school. I'm moving 2000 miles away in two weeks.  

The relationship is good, and it's certainly the most stable relationship I've been in for several years.  Maybe ever?  There is very little drama, we talk about our issues instead of arguing, we've never had a fight, the sex is good and frequent, and there's only been one big difficult upset. At the same time, for me at least there was never a phase of major infatuation. I feel very strongly for him--I think I love him--but I've been very level-headed about the whole thing, knowing that I'd be moving at the end of this summer for grad school. He, on the contrary, fell for me very quickly, and I know he really loves me and values the relationship.    

The main issue, I suppose, is that there's no foreseeable end date to the distance. I will be in grad school for two years, and the field I'm going into is highly competitive; unless I'm very lucky, I will have to move to wherever I manage to find a job.  That will almost definitely not be my home state, and besides I've spent so much of my life here that I am totally ready and open to settling elsewhere. Meanwhile, my SO moved to my state after college, specifically for the mountains. He had a high-paying job he hated, quit it two years later, and is now working a low-paying job he loves (and which is, admittedly, something he can do anywhere).  He's made a life here that suits him well.  We briefly discussed him moving with me, and he was at first open to the idea but quickly realized, financial issues aside, he's not ready to leave his job and friends.  I don't resent that at all, and in fact I would've felt very guilty/weird if he'd decided to move across the country with me after having only dated for 9 months.

I really, really don't want to break up, and neither does he. I feel like we're just getting started and there's so much more to experience with him (we haven't gone camping yet; we haven't visited a museum; we haven't gone on a road trip; we haven't gone out for a fancy meal!).  I want to do and explore everything with him, and it makes my heart ache to think that none of it will ever happen. But am I just setting myself up for bigger heartbreak later, when in two years' time we realize we can't live together? At which point he'll be 30, and I'll be 27, and that's a lot of time to 'waste' on an impossible relationship.  And in the meantime, I'll be a poor grad student, and he's living paycheck-to-paycheck (he'll never make a lot of money doing what he does) and won't be able to fly out to visit that often.  

I just don't know what to do, or how to proceed or how to feel.  Our conversations about the distance have always ended in 'I don’t want to break up, so let’s see how it goes; we will Skype often and visit when we can', but that feels so short-sighted to me. What sorts of real questions should we be asking each other before embarking on a relationship like this?  Do I need reassurance that he would definitely move to live with me if I got a job somewhere, or is that cruel?  (Of course it is; I might end up in the middle of nowhere. Meanwhile if I limited myself to job-hunting in my home state, I might never find employment.) Do I need reassurance that he'd be willing to quit his low-paying job in a couple years and make more money to maybe support a family? It seems wrong to ask or even suggest such things so early on, when the future is uncertain, but is that what is needed? 

In short, I want to be smart about this, and I want to emotionally prepare myself for the journey that's ahead, but I don't know where to start. Sorry if this all seems very obvious, but I've never done anything like this! Does anyone have any advice or insight, especially those of you who have faced an issue like this before?

_____________

Hi /r/relationships. Lately I have been struggling with feelings of jealousy over a female friend of my boyfriend's, Hikari. They have known each other for about a year or so and met through a mutual friend, Jessica. When my boyfriend and I first started dating, the topic of his past year of dating attempts came up in conversation somehow. It turns out he had asked out Hikari several months ago, but she had rejected him. My boyfriend has a ton of female friends, way more than male friends, but I don't feel uncomfortable about them because he hadn't asked them out. I feel different about Hikari because I feel that I am his second choice, and his first would be her but she wasn't interested.

Hikari is perfect; she is not only super cute but also very sweet and has a wide range of interests, a lot which are in common with my boyfriend's that I don't really share. She is the epitome of his type, which makes me nervous, and when he likes her photos on Facebook I become very insecure. My boyfriend keeps a present she got for him in Japan, a little pricey (around $50 to $60), and a card she wrote for him on his dresser. I knew all this very early on, but the thing is, at the time she was in Japan and my boyfriend told me they would probably never see each other again because she was only in the US for her studies. So I figured, everyone has someone in the past, and I should get over it because nothing is going to happen. Hikari and my boyfriend did keep in touch via free phone messaging apps, although in the last couple of months the frequency of communication between them had fallen.

This summer it turns out she's coming back to our city to continue her education. I think it's important to get to know my boyfriend's friends, plus I was friends with her on Facebook prior anyways, and thought she seemed like a very cool and interesting person. In addition I wanted to manage my feelings of jealousy, and always found that meeting and getting to know the girl helps a lot. So today my boyfriend, her, and I all went to lunch together. She and I got along very well and she did not act inappropriate at all; in fact she sounded very supportive of us. However, I noticed my boyfriend used a different tone when speaking to her than he uses with his other friends-- and even me. Very soft and tender, if I had to describe it.

I think my feelings and beliefs may partially stem from having had an extremely attractive (in both looks and personality) best female friend in high school. She had a ton of guy friends, and many of them would fall for her. Even long after being rejected, and even after they got into relationships, some which were several months long or even longer, many would still confess to having feelings for her or still having hope that they would one day be with her. Some of these guys weren't even sleazy. They were genuinely kind-hearted people, but had just fallen for a girl who didn't return their feelings. I'm so worried that this may be the case for me, my boyfriend, and Hikari.

I trust my boyfriend but I find it so difficult to believe someone can have a platonic relationship with someone like her-- because even I felt butterflies around her! (I am bisexual.) Even if it is platonic at the moment, I know feelings can slowly creep up on people and develop over time, without any foul intention. So maybe it's not my boyfriend I'm wary of, but human nature. And with her in the same city as us now, and how awesome my boyfriend thinks she is, I feel like they'll be seeing a lot more of each other. He clearly thinks very highly of her, as when we first started dating, he mentioned her on one of our first dates-- not in name, just mentioning that he had a very worldly friend who could speak a lot of languages, which isn't weird on its own but at that point he wasn't telling me about any of his other friends, and she isn't one of his closest friends either.

Please, /r/relationships, help me manage my feelings on this. I really want to let my boyfriend stay friends with Hikari, and I really like her as well. But past experiences and such make me think I should be wary. Advice would be greatly appreciated.","20/f] with [24/m], need advice dealing on issues of jealousy over female friend [25/m].

Background: He's my first and only relationship, and the first and only sex partner I've ever had (in fact, he's my first kiss and the first person I've ever been on more than one date with). We met online and eventually decided to meet up, and it just kinda snowballed from there.

He's incredibly sweet. I love hanging out with his friends and he gets along great with mine. He and I rarely fight, and even when we do, It's not much of a fight... we just talk calmly about why his/my feelings were hurt and how we can avoid it in the future, and an hour later, nobody's upset.

I should feel like I've hit the jackpot, given how many posts I see about loneliness on all the gay reddits, but...

I don't think I'm attracted to him anymore. He wasn't really my type in the first place, and I never had a crush on him... we really just hit it off on personality. I definitely DID develop an attraction to him after a few dates, and I would even say that I still love him, but I just don't feel aroused when I look at his face or body anymore. When we have sex, he constantly says things like you're so fucking hot, and I honestly can't return the compliment.

The crux of the issue is that he's fairly overweight, and that doesn't do it for me. I mean no judgment on him as a person and would never dream of shaming someone for their weight, I think the beauty of  bodies should be celebrated in all its variety. But as far as my libido goes, every time I see him naked I'm just... not into it. His weight hasn't changed since we met; it's just gotten harder and harder for me to channel our emotional connection into physical arousal. (I belabor this point because I've seen several highly upvoted comments in which guys who are not attracted to overweight people are harangued and called emotionally abusive, and I really really want to avoid that.)

He talks about how he wants to lose weight, but he barely tries to. I know how hard it is; I used to be overweight and lost ~50 lb to get into a healthy zone. So far I've tried to help him do so by eating healthy with him and going exercising with him, but that's been going on for months and he's just not losing weight. He knows exactly why he's not; he has to make the choice to tighten the reigns on his other meals if he actually wants to change his body.

I can't stay in a relationship where I'm not attracted to him. I want to know what it's like to have sex with a guy I can't keep my hands off of. I've never had that. I want to watch him lounge around in sexy underwear and get uncontrollably thirsty. I'm not willing to settle down in a purely emotional relationship this early in my life.

He's mentioned before that he doesn't ever want to be in a non-monogamous relationship, so I don't think an open relationship is an option. (Even if he agreed to it to try to save the relationship, he'd be doing so reluctantly and I know that's not healthy)

I have resigned myself to the fact that we'll have to talk about the attraction issue at some point. But I want to ask for advice from people who have been in similar situations... Do I tell him why I'm not that into him anymore and give him the chance to change it? I worry that it would crush his self esteem and he would never feel attractive around me again. But if I just tell him I'm not into him anymore and break it off without further explanation, I worry that I would be throwing away something really valuable and would deeply regret it.

I'm using a throwaway account because i don't want friends, or even my (ex?) girlfriend to know i am asking for advice.

The story of me and my girlfriend starts in the year 2013, i fell in love with that damaged girl who was struggling to get over her ex boyfriend, that she had been 7 months in a relationship with. 
After a few months of hard work i managed to make her fall in love with me and now, 1year and 6 months later, our story seems te have ended. A few months ago we broke up for a day too but she wasn't able to ignore me for a day and everything was fine again. This time though it doesn't seem like she will bend soon, which makes me sad to know I have let it come this far. 

First of all i'll provide you guys with some background information, which might be really important in the story. Then i will tell what caused the breakup to happen.
I want to thank you every single one of you who spends a few minutes of his life reading and commenting on a story of a total stranger. That means the world to me.  

So, we have had an amazing relationship so far, I am the type of boyfriend that likes to buy random presents just to see my girl smile. We have been on a city trip together for 3 days and things were awesome and i have always loved her with everything i had..
Well until a few months ago i guess, because I started feeling awkward to do the things i previously did, for example buying a lot of presents. Even visiting her house became more of a habit than something i really enjoy doing. Another weird thing i noticed is that i didn't get horny as much as before, although the times we had sex, like 1 time a week, were amazing! 

Another thing I noticed, and which I felt the most is that I got irritated by her because of insignificant things, for example a text message that seemed arrogant to me or her texting me all the time.

So let's get to the point of the story. Friday I attended her prom with her and we got in a fight because she irritated me, I admit, the fight was kinda my fault. Her dad picked her up from the prom and when she got home she sent me a message saying that it would be better to break up because we weren't able to make each other happy anymore. She even spoke about the 'shitrelationship' we had and even her mom told her it would be better to end the relationship.. 
Since friday night I haven't heard anything from her, it's now 3 days later and i haven't sent anything either because I don't know if the relationship is worth fighting for anymore. I love her, but I don't feel like i can't live without her, i probably easily can, although the idea of her being with someone else makes me sick.

So right now i got some questions, but feel free to ask more, i will check the comments regularly. 

1. Are those awkward feelings and not having the need to text the whole time sings that she isn't the one for me, or is it just  a bad moment in the relationship ? (which I had before once, i kinda have affectionate moodswings you could say) 

2. Even if it's just  a bad moment, is there still a chance we get together again ? The things she said about our relationship and her mom's opinion really hurt me

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 6 years. We met at the beginning of college and just clicked immediately. We have had some fights and bumps along the way, but we have always worked things out pretty easily. I have always trusted her 100% and I have never had any doubts until this.

 


Recently things had started to feel different to me. She started to seem distant, and she had no interest in any physical intimacy. She had just finished grad school, and I knew that she was very stressed about finding a job, so I kind of brushed it off as a result of that stress. 

 


Then she went on a 4-day (3 nights) camping trip with a group of ~15 people that included two of her best friends and a bunch of their friends (guys and girls). I didn't go, because camping just isn't my thing. This is something that she knows/understands, no big deal. 

 


When she got back from her trip, the things that had seemed weird felt like they got even worse. Things like pulling away from a kiss, or seeming like she didn't want to really see me or talk to me at all. 



 
I still was just attributing all the weirdness that I had been noticing to a combination of stress and fatigue. But then I noticed that she had changed the password on her phone. This is when I started to feel worried that something was going on. Obviously everyone is entitled to privacy, and it should be fine to lock your phone, but we have just never had that privacy from each other. Previously, we had always known the passwords to each other's phones.
 



I never in a million years would think that she would cheat on me. That just isn't who she is. But I kept having this feeling that something is going on, and the phone locking thing was making me feel really weird.
 



I am not proud of what happened next. I saw her enter the password to her phone. I knew she was stressed so I didn't want to confront her about any of this. I figured I would just look at her phone and find nothing, then feel better. Like everything that I was noticing was all in my head. I couldn't resist. I invaded her privacy and looked at her texts. I felt like shit for doing it, and I still do. The thing is though, I didn't find nothing. I found messages to her two friends that she had been camping with talking about her crush on this guy that had been on the trip as well. 

 


According to the texts, this crush had been going on even before the trip. My gf had been out with her friend one day a few weeks earlier, and I didn't even know that other people people were there but apparently they were and this guy was one of them. That night she had sent a text to her other friend saying something like I need to talk to you, my stupid crush has intensified due to the various events of today. Therefore the crush was a thing even before that.




At one point her friend texted her something about the crush, and my gf said something like ugh, I'm a terrible person, what is wrong with me? Her friend replied that it was no big deal to just flirt as long as she didn't do anything with the guy. My gf responded to that saying Well actually while we were camping I snuck out of our tent and hooked up with him. which was immediately followed by multiple messages saying jk! I feel kind of stupid for this, but it made me feel pretty shitty that she would even make a joke about that.


 

Anyway, I couldn't really see these and then not talk to her about it, so I did. Her responses didn't really make me feel better. She said that the crush was nothing and that it's basically a joke. She said that nothing actually happened, and that she never wanted anything to happen. She wasn't texting the guy or messaging him on Facebook or anything. She had met him at her friend's party a few months earlier and had only ever been around him at 2 or 3 group things and then the camping trip. She ended up saying things like he was just there on the trip and he gave me attention so I flirted with him a little, but I don't actually like him! She said that crush is too strong of a word to describe her thoughts or feelings about this guy, and that she shouldn't have called it a crush. She has said things like I wish I could just show you, or that you could have just been there and seen that it was nothing, and she feels bad that I feel bad about it. At the same time as she said this, she wouldn't really explain anything to me. Like the message about the various events that had intensified her crush. 


 

Anyway, it has now been a little over 2 weeks since we talked about this. Our relationship has felt back to normal, if not better than normal since we talked about it. In fact, for about a week before I read her texts, things had been feeling better, even though I had still felt like something was a little off. I just can't seem to move 100% past this. I still have some residual shitty feelings about it.

 


I believe her 100% that nothing happened, but I also feel like her explanation of it to me was really lacking. I wish she would have had a better response for me. I feel like for a crush to exist then maybe she feels like something is missing in our relationship.  I really don't think she is lying about any of it, but at the same time some of her responses to me just don't feel right. 


 

I want to trust her 100% again but I just can't right now. I haven't said this to her, but the best example of my trust issues that I can give is that if she wanted to hang out with this group of friends again next weekend, I would not feel okay about her going unless I go too. I obviously wouldn't stop her from doing what she wants, but I would be at home feeling like shit the whole time. I feel like a schmuck, because while she was camping my thoughts were just along the lines of like I hope she is having a good trip! not oh god I hope she isn't gonna hook up with some guy. Now I feel like I will be having thoughts closer to the ladder.


 

Also, I feel stupid, like I am way overreacting to just a crush, but I am an anxious person and I can't really help that I have blown this up in my head to be probably way worse than it was. I also am reacting this strongly because in 6 years we have never had anything like this, and this is just a few months before we are planning to move in together, and probably be looking towards marriage before too long (this is something we have already talked about in the past even).
 
 

 
So reddit, is this just my problem? Am I overreacting and I just need to get over it because nothing happened? Am I reasonably upset by this, but it will just go away with time? Do I need to talk to her more about it? Do you think something worse happened than what she told me?

We're both heavily into the church which has been a good foundation for the relationship as well.


He's just been diagnosed with depression. I'd suspected it for quite some time and had brought it up in conversation once or twice when he'd gotten really low, but he always vehemently denied it, just thinking he was sad or sick or should just be better than he was. Caused a couple of anxiety issues in the relationship for a while for me, where he'd spiral down and tell me I deserved better and then not talk to me for hours, leaving me freaking out that he'd either hurt himself (even though there's no history of harming) or was planning on leaving me because, as I said, I deserve better. So now whenever he's upset I get irrationally worried that the same thing is going to happen, even though we talked about it and he promised he'd work better on the not talking side of things.


I find that I'm struggling because I've got a bit of a history of mental heath things too, nothing major just spurts of depression caused by events in the past. I'm finding that it's hard to keep myself entirely balanced at the moment because I'm so focused on being there as a support for him. He'll call me every night to complain or vent or cry about his life, which is heartbreaking, but it's okay because I think for him it's good just to have someone to speak to because he's always been very closed off.

I have no clue what came over me. It's like my body went into autopilot and without a second to think, I introduced myself. I didn't think about being rejected. Didn't care about my friend. I didn't care what they were talking about. There were no thoughts in my mind. I just needed to meet this girl...

And to think I thought she was good looking from a distance. She was more beautiful than I could ever imagine. Gorgeous hazel eyes. Straight, jet black hair. A smile that lit up my world and a voice that soothes my soul.

We became close fairly quickly and soon enough we started dating. Everything was great for a while. We talked all the time. Together every chance we had; taking her to class, standing in the crowded commons, lunch, parking lot, etc.. We didn't care about PDA. She received a detention because we made out in the parking lot once, that was funny. She'd come over to my place on weekends, days she wasn't working and days I didn't have sport practices to watch a movie. When I got my liscense, we started going on real dates. We would be on the phone for hours before bed on nights we weren't together. Everything was amazing. I was so in love with this girl. We would write letters to eachother (don't tell anyone). I don't remember who initiated that. 

Our first breakup was the start of the cycle. It wasn't anything crazy, just a stupid excuse. Insecurity and possibly peer pressure. Her friends probably said something that got to her. She was a junior while I was a freshman. We had different friend groups, but it was never a problem before. Everything seemed to be a huge deal to her. We would get together again and everything would be great. Then something stupid would come up and we'd split. We'd exchange who initiated contact, and who wanted to split. I broke up with her a couple times because I was tired of the drama. 

We would be together a couple weeks here, a month there. Each time we broke up it seemed to hurt more and get worse. I tried to date other people in between, for a while, but they never really went anywhere. And every time we got back together we just picked up right where we left off. Even after she graduated we were on and off. I cringe, now, thinking about all of the opportunities I had with people back in the day and even recently.

Around the end of my junior year I started really looking into my career options. Both of my parents are retired Airforce, so the military has always been something I've considered. Commercial diving is another career I was very curious about. Then, science/biology/chemistry have always been my strong points academically. I had/have options, but my ex has always been in the picture. We did our thing senior year and maybe once more after that. A year after I graduated she came back again. I had been working/saving for school. Having fun with hometown friends before I left. 

She comes back saying shes here for good, keep promises, start life. Well, that didnt last long so I put my foot down. I told her that I never wanted to see her again, ever. This circle we run around has gone on for far too long and I don't want to do it anymore. The older we get the more it starts to matter. The more we do this the harder it gets. I dont want to hurt anymore. Stop lying. Stop wasting my time. Just stop. It was a little more strongly worded than that, but I'm sure you can get the picture and that was that... or so I thought.

I regretted it the day after. What have I just done? I was out of it for a long time, but I kept on. I had come too far to fuck up now. So I continued to work, save and get ready for school. Just so you know, dive school is expensive when you pay for it yourself. Financial aid only covers so much. I was saving not only for tuition, there is no campus housing, but also an apartment and I had to have enough money to keep me afloat if my current job wouldnt transfer me and it took a while to find a new job. 

Two years of more work and little to no social life go by. I get home from work one day and do the usual. I check Facebook and to my surprise, I have a message. Everyone usually just texts me. I wonder who this i- ...fuck. sure enough, she was trying to get in contact with me. I didn't read it right away. I didn't know if I even wanted to. It had been two years and last time we spoke, I basically told her to fuck off. So I thought about it all week and she ended up going through a friend to let me know she messaged me. So I read it. She goes on to say how she doesn't like the person she has become. How she was seeing someone who turned out to be abusive. That she realizes everything she has put me through and is sorry for what she's done. Wishes me the best, etc. I still have the message. 

I needed more time. I wasn't sure if I was going to reply. I took another week to think about what I was going to say. I still had feelings, but I also understand it's been 2 years. She may not be interested and just wanted closure, which was fine with me. But I just wanted to put in my side of the story. Instead of messaging or passing off a letter, I wanted to actually talk. So I went and picked her up, took her out to a spot and we talked.

We ended up spending 8 hours together. I said everything I needed to say. I told her I could have handled the last time we spoke a little better. I told her that I'd been working my ass off for school and how the military could still be an option.  How i still had feelings for her, but I understood that she may have moved on. If she wanted closure, that would have been fine too. She said she was glad I hadn't left yet and wanted to spend more time with me. That she misses me and is thankful that I'm still interested, because she is too. We talked more, about what we'd been up to. Things were going well, so we went and grabbed dinner at like 11:30pm. When we were done, we headed back to my truck, talked some more and cuddled up in the back for a while. Classy I know, but I live in a country town. It's what we do. 

What she didn't know was, I was going to test her. She seemed fine with me going to dive school. She was not sure about the military though. She preferred that I didn't go. Understandable. So the plan was that if she could prove she was was going to stick it out this time, I'd give up the military, go to school and settle down. Do whatever I needed to to make our future together worth it.

We talk more in coming days. She wants to take things slow, but she knows without a doubt she wants to be with me. I'm like cool, this is probably the best way to go about this. We will work our way back into it. As much as I wanted to move fast, I matched her pace. Things were wonderful, though. Took her out a few times, made some plans. I was working my way up to having her stay over. She said it was hard for her to sleep alone. I would've had her over sooner, but I was in the middle of moving. I was fixing up the place for the new residents. Everything was everywhere. Paint cans, trash, equipment, typical moving mess. I wanted to be in the new place before she came over. I wanted to start fresh. Maybe I waited too long.

Things were fine for a little while then out of fucking no where, she freaked out and said she felt like we were moving too fast. I panicked a little bit, but I took it for what it was. But deep down I knew where this was going and it was only going to get worse. 

I tried. I tried so damn hard to keep the fire going. She went back to doing the same thing she's always done, even after saying she was done being that person. Pushing me further and further away. I did everything I possibly could. She wasn't having any of it. She just wanted to be friends.

Now before anyone assumes friendzoned, that's not how it works with this girl. I have never EVER been able to be just friends with her. Why? Because she is so much more than that to me. She's my friend, best friend, lover and after everything we've been through, there is absolutely no way. I have had healthy friendships with ex girlfriends before. It's just this girl, I can't. I've tried, trust me. It's torture. 

So after trying everything I could, I caved. I couldn't do it anymore. I stopped talking to her. Told her I was just going to leave. I started training harder and continued getting ready for the military. That was January, this year. 

Beginning of april. I felt like I needed to talk to her. Explain what was going on. My plan, the test. How I would have given it all up to be with her. If this was going to be the last time we ever spoke, I wanted EVERYTHING on the table. There are a couple things in our relationship that happened that we never really spoken about and I wanted to. I wanted to give us an official chance to end it all for good. I called her to see if she would be interested in talking.

She wasnt able to meet but would talk on the phone. I explained everything. The military, the test, what went down a couple months ago. We caught up a little bit as well. I could have gone without hearing what she said. She ended up moving back in with her abusive ex. She was in his place as we spoke, but he wasnt home. Man, my heart sank. I am still very much in love with her and I wanted to tell her. I explained the moving situation. She said she thinks about how it could have been different if she stayed over. So I told her I had more to say, that I didnt know about the ex and if she didn't want or wasn't comfortable listening, she could just stop me and that would be that. 

She wanted to hear what I had to say, so I confessed my love. I asked several times if she wanted me to stop, but every time she pushed me forward. I talked about memories, things we used to do, plans we had for the future, things I wanted us to continue doing and how I still wanted it all. She started crying. She cried harder the further I went. I told I hadn't given up, but she needs to figure out what she absolutely wanted and stick with it. I told her to do her own thing, take however much time she needs. If she decides she wants to fix things, I'd take her. If not, all she has to do is say goodbye and stay away for good. Because the only chance I have at moving on is if we have zero contact. Obviously more in depth but that's where I ended it, mostly because I was about to lose it myself. I paused for a moment, all she did was cry. I said goodnight and hung up.

So here I am today and I haven't heard from her. As far as she knows I'm leaving or thinks I've already left. I'm good to go, all I have to do is walk in, test and sign. I stuck around for the extra time in case she did come back, but she doesn't know that. As far as I know she could be happy and whatshisname could have got his shit together. 

My problem here is I want to sign next month. I'm done waiting, I'm ready now. For either outcome, but I want to know what she's doing. She never said goodbye. She started crying on the phone. I don't know what that cry even meant. I think about it every day, its affecting my dreams when i sleep. Hell, sometimes I dont even get sleep. My friend thinks the problem was the not being able to stay over. He thinks I should tell her that I haven't left/signed yet and that I should tell her that if she comes back, I will find us a place for just her and I. Financially, I wouldn't have a problem. My old job wants me back and they're willing to pay me more. I could take their offer at any time. The only reason I have my current manager job is because it was close to home and I wasn't planning on being around long. I know it'd work, I have zero doubts about it. I'd just work, go to school, get a degree and a career. She would have no problem finding a job close to wherever we move if she needed to. I'm just not sure how I should go about either decision.

So, Reddit, what do you think? Should I contact her and let her know? Should I say fuck it and move forward? Should I do something different? As i said, i love her, but i literally can't continue running in circles anymore. I just want to be done either way. Any serious advice would be greatly appreciated.

11542,Relationships,25o6xi,"This is fucking long and I’m sorry if it’s all over the place. I was in sort of a hurry. 


My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and living together for 1 year. We've always had an amazing relationship. We get along great, have similar interests and hobbies. 


He tells me everyday and all of the time that he loves me and shows me in cute little ways that he does. We are definitely still very much in love but there's stuff I would like for us to work on. 


Lately, however, I've been feeling lonely, ugly and unnoticed. Lonely feels weird for me to admit because he works from home so I get to see him as soon as I get home from work and on the weekends. Emotionally I feel like he's been absent and I have a feeling it's because he's too comfortable. He never takes me out on dates, compliments me, or talks about anything other than himself. I feel like I'm being needy but what if I'm not? 


I find myself not doing little things that I used to be on top of at all times. Simple things like getting ready (unless it's the weekend and we go out with friends), painting my nails, shaving (I'm not getting any so why the fuck would I), doing my makeup, etc. My reason or excuse is because I know he won't notice or acknowledge it. I've also noticed I don't self-improve anymore in other ways either. For example I used to paint and play instruments.


I get home and we just kind of separate into our own little worlds. For example: he’ll be upstairs fucking with his comp or working on a design, and me downstairs cooking dinner, working on a project or watching Netflix.


When it comes time for bed, he RARELY sleeps with me. He works on his designs that he could've worked on earlier that day. He will stay up until 3am to 4am then finally slip into our bed. I wish he would at least sleep next to me. I miss that. Going to bed alone every night just feels so lonely. 


I know I'm a VERY insecure person and difficult to deal with at times. A conversation was brought up the other night because he found some semi-naked photos on my phone and thought I was sending them someone. I took them as progress pics for myself because I wanted to compare them with older photos so the conversation about my well known eating disorder (I've been struggling with bulimia for 6 years) came up as well to justify my insecurities thus taking pictures to see if I've lost any weight. Although, I've progressed tremendously and have been eating well every week and have noticed amazing results which I'm very proud of, but the urge still lingers, especially if I've eaten something bad like junk or fast food. He doesn’t know I still purge. I’ve hid it from him for about 3 years now. I feel bad about it but I know he won’t understand it and make my problem worse. He’s the type to tell me to just snap out of it because I'm beautiful. I HATE THAT RESPONSE. 


Sex is something I'm very underwhelmed with between us. He's fine with having sex about once or twice a week which is not fine with me. This has always been a problem and anytime it's discussed, we fight. He's never been a horn dog and my sex drive is way more intense. We only have sex if I initiate it, and that's quite often but he only gives it to me 3 times a week max. I want a healthier way to approach this problem I have without it turning into a fight.


Everything I’ve written has already been discussed at some point and resorted to a fight and was never worked on. He promises me that he’ll make a difference and I’ve done the same but he never pulls through so we just go back to square one with more bickering and fighting. I would like some advice on approaching my problems to him without a fight coming from it. 


Little things I would like to add: He doesn't have a car so he has to use mine and sometimes he takes me to work, goes to run some errands, and then picks me up. I don’t feel like he’s cheating on me. He’s an artist, graphic designer and he owns his own streetwear company so he’s fairly busy most if not all days. 


We’re going to go to dinner tonight so we can talk. I would like to know if anyone has had similar problems with their SO and how you fixed them. 


**tl;dr**: Bf and I have issues in almost every department a relationship could have. We're going to dinner tonight and I would like to know how should I bring them up so we can work on them without a fight as the result? 


EDIT: I meant to say MY sex drive is way more intense. I am **NOT** looking for ways to break up with him. That's not going to happen. I'm asking for ways or for some advice on working this all out. ",Me [20F] with my boyfriend [25M] of 4 years have issues in almost every department of our relationship.,0.0,False,14.0,5.0,1400199090.0,/r/relationships/comments/25o6xi/me_20f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_of_4_years_have/,Romantic
11544,Relationships,320jqt,"Alright, so me and my boyfriend have been together for almost 5 years.  He is my best friend and I love him. But, he has the maturity of a 12 year old boy and it is slowly driving me insane.  I don't mind touching at all, I am an affectionate person.  But the way he touches me is not what I would describe as affectionate.  In fact, it's the complete opposite and it turns me off.

For example, we will be laying on the couch/in bed and he can't just cuddle.  When I am relaxing like that, I don't mind laying with eachother or holding hands, etc. But it can never be just that with him.  He's constantly trying to grab my ass, grab my boobs, put his hand down my pants or put my hands on him in a sexual way.  Literally, constantly.  I've told him it makes me feel like a piece of meat and then he goes into defensive mode saying, Fine! I just won't touch you anymore until you say it's ok. It's not my fault you're attractive.  I'm glad he's that attracted to me but I do not need my boobs grabbed every 5 seconds when I'm just trying to relax.

Besides the sexual stuff, he's always doing things like poking me, rolling over so he's literally laying on top of me, tickling me, or doing things like getting really close to my face and breathing or licking me because he thinks it's funny. I try to tell him nicely to stop but he will keep doing it because it's so funny to annoy me.  Then I get seriously pissed because I can't take it anymore.  It literally raises my blood pressure when I feel like I can't just relax calmly with him. I feel like I am constantly being smothered instead of just being able to lay with him and enjoy our time together.  It's not like I'm ignoring him or we don't have sex eventually, so I don't understand why he does it except that he gets entertainment out of annoying me.  I like my personal space and he is ALWAYS invading it.  This example is going to sound totally ridiculous, but last night he said something smelled and I asked him like what? and he proceeded to put his fingers under my nose that he had just scratched his ass with.  This happens far more often than it should.  I have a sense of humor but I think that just takes it way too far.  At that point, I got really fed up and told him that it wasn't funny, that's just plain disrespectful and to leave me alone because I was done dealing with it at the time.  Then when I tried to start a conversation with him about something else and drop it, he was all pissy and wouldn't respond.  He told me he wasn't talking to me because I was being mean.

In fact, the more I write this the more I realize he guilt trips me when I get upset with him.  Like the other night, we went out for a friend's birthday and he got pretty drunk.  He was being loud,  obnoxious, and rude to the point where the bartender was annoyed and family members of the friend were looking at me like, poor you. I have even had people tell me they don't know how I deal with it.  To add to that, he sat at the bar all night with his friends and left me at the table with nobody to talk to really.  I don't need to be babysat, but when I go somewhere with my boyfriend I do like to spend time with him.  He literally didn't acknowledge me when I was trying to talk to him so I just sat there alone and ate. (The friend we were there for was talking with her family at the time).  When I told him the next day I was annoyed because of his obnoxious drunk self and for ignoring me, he told me I was being mean and turned it around on me.

Yes, I have tried to talk about it to him but he never listens and always turns it around on me and ignores me when I tell him I'm upset at the way he acted.  I am by no means perfect, but he never really tells me anything he's annoyed at because he's very easy-going and doesn't care about much.  I used to think hey, someday I'd like to marry this guy if we are still together when we're older, but the more he invades my space and acts like a child the more I'm like...I would go insane if I had to deal with this for the rest of my life.

Reddit, what do I do?!

Edit: I am dumb and forgot to add, he does have ADHD which he takes medicine for, but only on days that he has school. While I do truely understand that this probably contributes to some of his behavior, I don't think it excuses it as a 22 year old adult.

11546,Relationships,1r6snq,"I met this guy 2 and a half years ago through a mutual friend of ours. I was in high school, he was an attractive guy in a successful band who happened to live near me. Basically, I was stoked. After we hung out he gave me his number and we began talking frequently. He went to Arizona to record an album for a little over a month and we made plans to hang out the night he got back. He picked me up from my friends house (didn't have my license yet..) and we ended up hooking up, but didn't have sex. That was actually the first time I had really hooked up with someone besides some painfully awkward and quick high school memories. We remained friends for a while after that and hooked up a few times, minus the sex, until I turned 19.  We stopped talking because the situation made me feel dirty and uncomfortable. This lasted for a few months before we both realized we missed our friendship and started talking every day again. 

August 2012 I lost my virginity to him, and it changed things. Our friendship got a lot more intense. We began talking even more frequently, and about serious things. His brother died of a heroin overdose just 2 months before I met him, and my father was a constant come and go figure due to a heroin addiction himself, and we often were each others comfort when we were trying to deal with these situations. We have the exact same taste in music, our favorite films are the same, and when we hang out it's magnetic. I can't really describe it, but he's just my best friend. We began telling each other we loved each other daily. And meant it. 

I remember there was one night after we had slept together I just told him I couldn't do this anymore and he cried the hardest I've seen anyone cry and just repeated over and over again, please don't leave me. 

We continued sleeping together weekly, sometimes only monthly. But it was consistent. Since last August there hasn't been a month I don't think we've been intimate. At the same time though an intellectual and emotional intimate level has developed to become just as strong as our physical intimacy. We often engage in debates about issues facing our city of Detroit and current event news from all over the world (that we often find via reddit). At the same time whenever one of has an emotional breakdown or anxiety attack (we both suffer from severe depression) we are always the go-to person. Long phone calls and endless phone calls are very common. My dad passed away of a heroin overdose this summer and he's the only person I've been able to open up to about it.

This all sounds great, but I feel like I'm living in a very temporary bliss. One day he's gonna get a girlfriend and then what? We've never been friends without a physical aspect, and I just don't think I could ever view him without that regard because he was my first (and the only person I've slept with more than once, and the only person I've slept with that I loved, and the only person I know loved me). At the same time, we're very openly inseparable. Everyone associates me with him, there isn't a day when he isn't the first person I talk too and the last person I say goodnight too. 

He tells me I'm such a beautiful and intelligent individual, but I'm also very aware he will never date me. But I'm so physically and emotionally attached to him, no one else even seems desirable to me. The idea of looking at anyone else the way I look at him just seems ridiculous. I haven't been able to date or go on dates with anyone in the last year because my weird relationship with him isn't something I can sacrifice and I'm 100% against cheating.

And as much as I've just been playing naive for the last year, I know that this situation can't last forever. Do you guys think there is anything I can do to make this work? Or am I just royally screwed. I really don't have faith that we could be friends without the physical aspect. And part of me loves him in a way I know he doesn't reciprocate. But losing his friendship, guidance, care, and heart isn't something I'm prepared to do. Help? :(

11547,Breakups,2cxawc,"TL;DR - Broke up when I left to travel. Came back, but she'd already made up her mind that it wasn't worth fixing. Months later she desperately wants to be friends and throws out strong signals of feelings when we are together then denies them when I try to talk about it later.


Hi guys. I started dating this girl when we were 14. We grew up together. She was my best friend and we went all through high school together. At the end of high school I either had to decide to stay with her and attend community college locally or break up and go on to a 4 year school farther away. 

This stressed me out to no end. I didn't want to make a decision and our relationship suffered. Having sex made me panic, because I thought if she got pregnant my choice would be made for me. It's not that I didn't love her I just couldn't stand the idea of not being able to choose. I tried to stop having sex with her, but - of course - that ruined her self esteem and upset her a ton. I started avoiding being alone with her at all. She cried about it a lot. 

Instead of making any decision about college or my future I decided to travel. I thought it would let me get away from the situation and look at it more objectively. By the time I was ready to leave I had realized I didn't want to be without her, but she knew it was something I'd wanted to do for a long time and, like a good girlfriend, pushed me to go even after I told her I didn't want to anymore. She thought it was nerves, I think. The distance was too much for her, though, and she broke up with me. 

We broke up last fall. I had finally kind of admitted to myself it was over a few months ago. We never talked, we weren't friends, nothing. Then 3 weeks ago she got in my car with me after church and talked to me for two hours about wanting to be friends and stuff. Ok :) I was excited, because I still wanted to be friends. I'd missed her a lot. 

That Friday we end up at the same party. She never parties. Ever. By the time I'm there she is already drunk. She goes up to the house to go to the bathroom. A guy that's been trying to get in her pants for a while is up there. They make out. I immediately find out about it, and she sees that I'm fuming. She pulls me outside and we talk about it. She tells me he didn't mean anything she's just drunk. I mean way more to her than him. (Obviously she just meant she didn't mean to hurt me, not anything else, I don't think.) We end up talking and whatever for about an hour, because I was able to stay mad for about the total of 2 minutes of us talking.

That Sunday her mother invites me over to their house for pizza. I go because there is no way her mom would have invited me over to their house without asking her, right? I asked her sister and she agreed, so I went over. It starts off kind of awkward, but we end up slipping back into hanging out really fast. I help her rip the acryllic nails off her fingers. She funny-screams for me to come in her room while she gets ready to go hang out with her friend. When I lay down on her bed, I notice one of my shirts on the floor. SHE STILL SLEEPS IN MY SHIRTS WTF. I don't say anything about it. We just talk about nothing and enjoy hanging out. 

She drives me back to my car (I rode out with her sister, we are good friends) and on the way she asks me ten times if I hate her. Of course I told her that I didn't. She segways this into the most honest conversation about why we broke up since it happened. Every other time we talked about it she said it was other things: I drink too much (her dad's an alcoholic, I really should have been more considerate in that regard, but I only ever drank like a beer with dinner or something. I never got drunk while we were dating.), I wouldn't be a good father, she had to fight me to go to church with her, etc. This time we talked about the real problems, and she sobbed. We got to her sister's house and kept talking in the car. I held her hand and she looked out the window and cried. Without thinking, I turned her chin and kissed her. She didn't push me away or anything. When I pulled away she said. Why did you do that?. I kissed her again. She said This is a bad idea. Then she joked about my bad timing. She didn't get upset or anything. She didn't move away from me. We just kept talking about our relationship.

I told her I'd have to put her number back in my phone (I still remembered it. I just deleted her name out of my adresses.) She asked me when I removed it, and I told her I deleted it when I threw away all the things she'd given me. That made her start sobbing again.

Anyway, we kept talking for a while, and I got out of the car.

The next day I tried texting her, but she would only text back single lines of text, and it was always like an hour after I first texted her. We talk about it that night, and she doesn't think exes should text. Uh, ok. We argue about it a little bit. Nothing major.

Last night I am drinking, and I decide to ask her about the shirt I saw on her floor. She flips out and tells me she's just going to block my number. She doesn't want to talk about depressing stuff. She just wears it because it's comfortable. Don't worry, though, she'll never wear it again. WHAT!?!?!? I don't understand.

Its also only her first real relationship. She is a super sweet girl, very understanding and has never fought with me or hardly has been mad at me. We also go to different schools, so I see her once a week or so. Honesty is something we both keep in mind with each other seriously. However, recently she found out one of her guy friends likes her, and she is frustrated. She said its stressing her out and taxing her mind, and said she likes him. Confused on how she can like him and still love me, and feels really stupid and like a fool. She thought the retreat for her school would help her think, but didn't. She hasn't been herself, she isn't as emotional when I talk to her or text her, and it seems hardly makes an effort to seem interesting, like I'm just a friend or something. But we still text everyday. I'm trying to be supportive and help her, but it's hard to when I feel like she's disconnected from me. She would never cheat on me though, as she said nothing happened at all, and is being really honest with me about everything. I just don't know if I should just give her time or what?

11549,Relationships,1ov1ou,"We met at the end of last year and started dating pretty seriously right off the bat. I was really infatuated with him, and I think he did really like me as well. But, come to find out he'd just gotten out of a serious relationship, and his ex had already moved on. So, I think the need to compete with her kind of, just a little, drove his passion for me at this stage. 

Later on, several months into the relationship, I figure out that he wasn't over her. He never crossed any lines, but that could be because she never gave him that option. I was really hurt, because I'd lived under the illusion that he was really head over heals for me. Since this time, it's been hard for me to take him seriously. But, even more than that I've noticed his attitude toward me change after I questioned him about his feelings for his ex. Overall, the relationship has turned into a struggle because I feel like I'm failing to meet his expectations. I'll explain the main things below. 


He doesn't listen to me and usually writes off my emotional concerns. He'll say 'he is too tire' or doesn't consider the topic worthy of conversation. Maybe, I am too into 'talking things out,' but it's just how I function. 

He says I'm too sensitive, negative, and irritate him. It's true I can be sensitive, but I feel he's constantly nitpicking at my behavior. If I act too nonchalant about things, I'm being weird. If I express some concern or irritation, I'm brining him down. I don't mind him teasing me, which I think is what happens a lot of times, but sometimes it needs to stop. If you respect somebody, don't you want to have genuine communications with them, and not just be trying to get under their skin?


Overall, he just doesn't respect me. I have to do all the communicating, emotional and otherwise. I call him to hang out. To his credit, he comes. So, I don't really mind that part of his behavior too much. Sometimes it'd be nice to get the attention in the relationship. Occasionally, he'll specifically disregard a request and then say I'm being controlling when I get frustrated. The other night, I was waiting up for him to get off work, so he could come over. At 2, I get a text saying he's been off for awhile. I told him that it was rude to not just let me know when he got off, even if he didn't want to hang out, so I could go to bed. He ended up coming over, but then to prove a point that I can't control him, just ignored me the entire time. 


I guess my question is how to I demonstrate to my boyfriend that I have no desire to control his life? He does things all the time, which he knows will frustrate me. I never give him any ultimatums or make threats. It seems like he's set me up as his adversary and not his partner. I know it's a young relationship, so maybe I should just let it slide. Communicating my concerns is not an option. He won't talk to me and will turn the whole thing back on me, saying I have issues. 

Should I just give him space? Or, what else is even possible to improve this situation?

11550,Relationships,1vwb9k,"Over the past few years I have been struggling with all kinds of physical symptoms stemming from anxiety. I've tried all sorts of treatments (therapy, non-SSRI, exercise) with no to limited success. I've always tried to avoid the SSRI class until now due to its notorious sexual side effects, as even when I was single, sex was a big part of my life.

A few months ago I started taking a small dosage of Lexapro (SSRI) and had very promising results after the first month. Even though I had never told her I was on meds, my girlfriend brought up at dinner that I had been much more affectionate and in a better mood all around that week. However it was still fizzling out in the evenings, so my doctor recommended raising the dosage. The only drawback to my starting dosage was that it was taking me slightly longer to finish,  thus I became worried that increasing the dose would increase the side effects and I asked my doctor if we could once again, pursue other avenues. 

Well after many more unsuccessful treatments I want to try Lexapro again, I just don't know whether or not I should tell her before I start taking them what the side effects could potentially be. That is, it could affect our sex life.

As far as us, we were originally late night hookups for each other, before we started hanging out earlier and earlier, going out to dinner then lunch, then we finally started dating. We have sex 4-5 times a week currently, but its usually me initiating and she doesn't really seem to care if we only have sex one or two times in a given week.

**My girlfriend had been acting strange the past few months.** I've been very open and trusting with her, so I didn't keep it a secret that I felt like something was up. Knowing her stance on cheating, I decide to take her at her word that she was simply too busy to spend much time together. Fast forward to last night, my suspicions are higher than ever, and I finally did a thing I never thought I'd do, and **I snooped on her new cell phone** (as she slept next to me), which she's only had for a little over a week now. I found many disturbing things.

# First finding
She has an ex-girlfriend, which according to her, had raped her with a guy (as in the guy raped her, too) she didn't know, years ago. This is the story she told me, this is the story I believed. **I came to find out that not only has she been getting together with this ex-girlfriend, but she's also been snapchatting back and forth multiple times per day with her.** This calls the whole rape story into question for me. It also caught her in a major lie, which was that she had no desire to rekindle a friendship with this woman.

# Second finding
I looked through more of her texts, and I caught her in more lies. She had been telling me **she'd been busy** with work, and studying, but it appears **she had plenty of free time for her friends, and drugs**. If that's not enough, **the way she spoke about me with her friends was worrisome**. I had confronted her earlier in the day about her not spending time with me, and during that conversation, she had been sharing it with her friend, where they'd laugh, call me names, and mock me with a lot of boo hoo waaah waaah comments. I guess I'm quite an asshole to want to spend time with my girlfriend.

# Third finding
The last thing I saw was a **text conversation from someone with just a phone number for a name**. She'd been texting back and forth with this person, sending pictures, and **telling this person that I was her ex since I don't know a couple of weeks ago.** She had already **been on a few dates with this person** by the time I read the texts.

# The confrontation
At 4 in the morning, I switched on the lights, handed her the phone, and I asked who she was texting with. **Initially she claimed not to know who it was or where the conversation I was showing her came from.** I gave her a few seconds to consider whether or not I'm that stupid, and **her story changed to he's some random guy.** I asked how long it had been going on, and her response was How old is the text message? After giving her a date, she tells me that long.  Earlier in the year, she saw me browsing gonewild, and told me that that was cheating on her. I brought that up. You said just browsing gonewild is cheating, and now you're actually cheating on me with this guy. **She responded that she wasn't cheating, that she was just hanging out with this guy.** She got out of bed, and left in complete shock.

# Further investigation
I compared the dates of the texts and snaps I saw with the our text history. Many of those dates fell on dates she promised to come over on, but then became too busy or too tired to make. A few times, **she'd tell me she just got off work when in actuality, she just finished up a date**. I didn't find the smoking gun, but there is little question in my mind as to there being infidelity involved.

# The new conflict
I don't know if she knows we're over, but we are. A lot of her things are still here, and I'm sure she's going to want them back at some point in the future. I don't want anything to do with her though. She betrayed me to a severe degree that can't be reconciled. Other than her collecting her things at some point, I'm worried she's going to try to talk about this with me, or start sending me long messages about how terrible of a person I am, and how it's all my fault. I don't know what to expect, and it's bothering me quite a bit. **If you have experience in this area, can you tell me what I can expect to happen before it's officially done with?**

# Additional details
She's also told me in the past that her oldest brother had been raping her from the time she was 8 to the time she was 12. Contrary to this story, she frequently talks about missing him, and just got back from visiting him in Texas for a week. With all of the recent discoveries, I call this into question, as well as any story she's told me, really. It's very upsetting, and difficult to deal with. I'm in shock and disbelief over all of this. I really loved this women, and I still really love her. I thought we'd go the distance. Now I'm just hurt.

EDIT 2:

# Thank you
Thanks for the information, and the advice, everyone. What I got from this is that I should anticipate rumors of rape, since she has a history of claiming people raped her. I'll be packing her things into a box and letting her know where she can find it. If she contacts me, and it's not important (like a medical thing), I'll ignore her. I'll get tested for STIs as soon as I can, and if any tests come back positive, the follow-up phone call to let her know about her medical issue will be my last contact with her.

# No thank you
As for the age discrimination that seems to have caught steam in here, I do have a few things to add. My ex and I are a little over 8 years apart in age. 100% of the relationship took place between consenting adults, and the people pretending 8 years is a massive, cradle-robbing generational gap of some kind are showing intolerance, not reason. Yes, she was 19 when we got together. She'll be 21 this year. If you can show me well-conducted, verifiable, repeatable studies that can back up the claim that 19-21 year olds are significantly more likely to cheat on their partners, I'll listen. Failing that, there's no reason to accept this claim as anything beyond (somewhat popular and accepted) intolerance.","Me [29 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] of 1.5 years, I caught her cheating, what can I expect to happen next?",0.0,False,51.0,41.0,1396599596.0,/r/relationships/comments/226d68/me_29_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_of_15_years_i/,Romantic

Anyway, we had been planning on taking said test on September, preparations had been going on since January and just yesterday she told me that she just didn't feel like spending time and money on taking it since she knew she was going to fail it.

11556,Relationships,386rwf,"Hi, this is my first post and I feel like it's dumb. I have the opposite of a problem. But I'm still kind of freaking out a little bit.

So I've been with my boyfriend, Jack, about 5 months. We were friends for a year before that and finally got together after months of mutual pining. I freaked out a little bit the week we got together, because I don't like feeling emotionally vulnerable. I like being in control and being levelheaded, and I realized right away that I could really, truly love this person. It scared me, but I held out and got over it.

Since then, things have been kind of incredible. I am young, but I've been in unhealthy longterm relationships before and I learned my lesson. Jack and I share the same career goals, the same political views, both feminists, both smart and driven. We are great at communicating--we never argue, because whenever one of us is feeling off we tell the other one and explain the problem. (The lack of fighting is not just a honeymoon stage thing; I'm like that with my female best friend too. We never fight, even when we annoy each other, because we're great at communicating respectfully.)

We respect each other. We have amazing conversations. We have so much in common but are different enough to keep things interesting and to challenge each other. We are considerate, we do little things for each other, we go on fun dates and have downtime, we have a healthy and respectful sex life despite both of us having some sexual issues*, we are very affectionate, etc. 

We just moved in together (NOT alone--I'm not nuts, I'm still rooming with my female best friend and Jack is rooming with another friend, we're just in the same apartment) and it's going great. I love spending so much time with him, but we do lots of group activities with our other friends too. No codependency issues.

Everything is oddly perfect. So now, of course, I'm freaking out. It's early, I'm young, but I can see this being longterm. I have never wanted to get married or have a family with someone. I could see myself doing that with him (after graduating college and being together at least 5 years, etc. Again, not nuts.). 

But I know everyone feels that way. Nobody enters a relationship planning to break up. And I guess I'm just scared because I don't want this to go away. I don't want him to just be my college boyfriend. I want him to be my partner. I love him and I'm scared it won't last, just because so many things don't last.

I don't know. This is probably the stupidest question ever. I should be over the moon, but instead I'm self sabotaging. 

I guess I'm just looking for reassurance. So many people say that when you're in your 20s, shit doesn't last. But suddenly I want it to last. Am I delusional? Am I just in the honeymoon stage? Is it possible for this to be a real, longterm thing?

*About the sexual issues--I'm on Lexapro which dampens (or rather doesn't?) my sexual drive. Jack is a FTM transgender man and still has some dysphoria issues. But again, we communicate and have a great sex life regardless.

11558,Relationships,3dulld,"TL:DR - Been treated like crap, tired of it, now she wants to work on herself, and make us wait. I'm finally standing up for myself and us after all these years. I dont know what to do anymore, she wants to work on us, but theres a part that doesnt. I have no intention of leaving. I am however, wondering if there is anything I can do for myself to get past this, while she is going through what she is going through. I don't blame her for anything, because I wasn't directly in her shoes. But I was directly by her side, always.     
           
It's been a long road to where I am today. We've been married for 6 years, and within a year of our marriage she became severely ill. I was there, helped her through the illness as best I could, with everything I had, both emotionally, physically and even spiritually. She doesn't know about the spiritual part but I was literally at a point where I was turning anywhere I could to try and help her. I would tell her I'd be going out drinking with friends, when in reality half the time I'd be sitting on the steps of a church that was near our apartment, asking for additional strength to get through the next day, and in hope that there would be an answer from a doctor that made sense and for once was right. I still haven't told her about this, nor will I ever. I'm not a spiritual person, at least not in practice. There have been good times and bad up to this point, and the good times are what keep me fighting for the woman I love, even though its fighting with her.     
      
She was with this illness for almost 3 years or so before she was finally able to get the right doctor, and the right medicine to make her feel better. However, the emotional turmoil that took place during and after, greatly affected her in a way that I don't even know how to describe.      
     
Not long after the repairing began, I wanted to work on us, and made that abundantly clear. She however, was so scarred by the event of her illness that she in turn shut me out, almost entirely if it weren't for the fact that we were married. She began having affairs, and then accused me of being invasive when I'd ask questions. Which in reality I've known about  her affair and have never said a word until recently. Everytime I would try and bring it up previously, I'd immediately be accused of being invasive and untrusting for what she called no reason. Yet I know with every bone in my body, and with proof that she was lying to me, every single time.      
      
But I forgive her, because in reality I know her mind wasn't in the best place, and I honestly can't say mine would be either. Once I found out about the affair, I shut down  internally and emotionally towards her. I stopped trying to do things with her, and since then have woken up every day expecting it to be the day she was going to leave to be with another man. Not because I thought I wasn't capable of providing for her in every way possible, or that I didn't know what she wanted, but becuase I know she was literally turning everywhere she could because she still ties me to her being sick. I tried fighting initially, but that didn't help things because she would explode on me, yelling, screaming, and essentially making me feel like the biggest piece of shit on earth for even saying anything remotely different than hello or goodbye.But even after, I brought up the main affair, and the fact that she has basically been intentionally trying to push me away for one reason or another. I honestly feel like a toy that can be put on the shelf whenever she wants. If she's having a good day its great, if its a bad day, I don't even get the slightest look of any emotion from her other than hate. There is no concern in her eyes, nor empathy for what she has done.                  
However, I still love this woman with everything I have, and still continue to try and put everything I have and even don't have into this relationship to repair this. Or at least have the desire to want to repair this still. But even after, I brought up the main affair, and the fact that she has basically been intentionally trying to push me away for one reason or another. I honestly feel like a toy that can be put on the shelf whenever she wants.

Now, I'm tired of leaving her alone, it hurts everytime I'm forced to do it, because it happens more and more frequently. I'm tired of being alone, and left alone. She has periods where she wants to talk, we talk, but only about what she wants to talk about. If I remotely bring something up, I'm shot down with she doesn't want to hear it, or she doesn't care, or she doesn't want to know.     
       
A mutual friend last night told me that it was my fault that I allowed the cheating to continue, even though I didnt find out about it until after the fact, nor did I know about the others until I finally confronted her about the one I did know about. I'm not sure she understands that I did in fact try for years, through the sickness and after the sickness. But during her being ill, she was cold and heartless, everything I did would be wrong, even if it was right. I'd get yelled at for doing anything if it was or wasnt her way. She would ridicule me for trying to do things, to the point she would make it seem as if I were stupid or something. I am not stupid, nor am I an idiot. I was just doing things to the best of my ability, while supporting two full grown adults. It wasn't easy for me...but I still tried. She doesn't see that. I don't think she will ever see that. Instead she most likely sees that I stopped trying and has held resentment from me for that since who knows when. I didn't stop trying, I didn't give up, I was forced to do so, and even then... I DIDN'T not entirely.       
     
We've begun therapy, but she refuses to allow us to heal at this point in time. I understand the need for her own issues to be resolved before we can work on us. But right now she can't even give me a solid answer if she ever wants this to work out, or if she wants us to eventually work on us. Now that I am fully trying again because I am at risk of losing the woman I love, she sees it as being too late. I have never stopped trying... I did however back down for a while, because it was the only way we could get through the days.    
      
I don't think she fully realizes all that she has done, versus how I have managed to handle things up to this point.
I can't turn to many friends, because they will hold all this against her. I cant turn to family, because it will only make matters worse, and my family has their own things they are going through, as is hers.

I just needed to get all of this out.

I will not give up, I will not give in, I never have and I never will.

The saga has come to an end everyone, but not how I'd intended.


Adam and I broke up this week. I am shattered by it completely. You have all helped me gain perspective throughout my relationship, and now I ask that you help me in the end. But first, I want to share the whole thing. 


Adam and I were together just shy of two years. He pursued me on and off for 3 years, waiting for me to be ready. He dated other people during this time obviously, but he never forgot about me and he would check in to see if I was ready for a date every 6 months or so. I had struggled with anxiety for the better part of a decade, and for me, relationships were a strong trigger for panic attacks. I had never dated anyone seriously because of this. And usually when I told someone to kick rocks, they did, and that would just reaffirm my idea that they would have left anyway. Adam was always extremely patient with me, he never rushed me in any way, and it took me a long time to realize that that was because we shared the same dark passenger. We both battled anxiety, just in different ways.


For me, it was a quick fix. I went off birth control while I was single (waste of money, right?) and miraculously my anxiety lifted. Soon after, I bumped into Adam on some idle Tuesday evening outside of a concert, and this time I agreed to go out with him when he asked. From that point on, we were inseparable. It only took a couple months for us to say I love you. I have experienced times of such a high level of happiness with him, that even now I feel lucky to have felt it.


For Adam, there is no quick fix. His anxiety has crippled our ability to be together over time. He lives entirely in the future, afraid. He knew he wasn't giving me the emotional connection I needed anymore, and he was distant and detached from our relationship. He didn't want to be, but we both felt it. It was affecting my ability to be apart from him, because every fibre of my being was screaming at me to hold onto this magnificent and beautiful chapter of my life that has completely changed me forever. We discussed over the course of a few days whether or not we would stay together through this, basically be on a break until he could sort out his issues, but I found it too hard. The waiting was killing me —quite literally, I haven't eaten in 4 days—and I had to let it go. We knew that being together at this point would ruin everything completely, and we weren't equipped to deal with this objectively while in the relationship.


It's crazy how the reason we understood each other so well, the thing that brought us together, would ultimately tear us apart. I encouraged him to seek counselling and he said he knows he should. Whether he actually does is out of my control. But I hope he does. I hope his life is amazing and sparkling, even if I'm not there to see it happen. I have no doubt that he loves me still, that he is leaving because he can't stand to watch us wither. We both cried a lot. I have never seen him cry and he always maintained that nothing ever did, so witnessing him fall apart was sad, yet reassuring. We held each other. We had one last kiss goodbye. And agreed that, for us, nothing is ever completely off the table. I can't wait for a change, and I need to move on from this. But maybe 3 years from now the stars will align again, and this time he will be ready. 


I am broken. I have lost my lover, my best friend, my confidante, the keeper of many ridiculous inside jokes and strange, new experiences. And I leave this behind me completely glad that it all happened, that we ended amicably. He left with a note in his pocket from me that read:


No matter what happens, I will always be here for you if you need me. It has been my greatest privilege to have been loved by you. I wouldn't change one second of it.

I, a lurker and a first poster have something I need advice with but no where to find. So, I have come here.

I met my current SO at a gathering and we hit it off. We would constantly text, chat on the phone, and hang out. We were friends at the start which progressed into us getting together. Now the problem is that I had no clue just how overbearing her parents were. 

I had been kept a secret from her parents until one night where they had checked her phone and found out all about me. I'm talking about Facebook stalking here as well. This had caused them to restrict her from seeing me, and talking to me. Her dad also had a 'stern' talking with me at her Birthday Party (2 or so weeks ago) which completely killed the mood for myself. He basically told me to 'back down' and discontinue our relationship. 

At this point of time I am at a loss at what I do with this relationship. I virtually don't get to talk to her, not even through text, and don't get to spend time with her. The only time I can see this getting better is when she turns 18. But that is two years, and that is a long time.

So Reddit, I come to you for advice. What are your opinions for what I should do with this pickle I am in. Also, what would you do in my situation?

11562,Relationships,1hobim,"Correction: Too. My apologies. Uggh.


**The Background**

I met him in August of 2011 through a friend from high school. I started hanging out with him (and his then girlfriend) in early January of 2012. They broke up in May, and he and I co-captained a sports team together. By July, we started hanging out basically every day, but nothing more. I didn't want to be his rebound and he didn't want me to be his rebound, but we developed a strong friendship full of laughter and respect... and maybe a little flirting. In August, I went abroad for a month travelling. We started officially dating a couple weeks after I got back (early October).

Between then and now, everything has been easy, fun, and comfortable, and I'm very much happy, satisfied, and in love. Our compatibility seems to be outrageously high, and issues (so far very minor) have been dealt with openly and respectfully. He owns his home while I rent a room from my parents, so I spend most of my free time at his house. Most nights, I cook dinner and we share the meal and some conversation. Some nights we simply coexist (I work from home and he enjoys playing piano, so we do that a lot), and others we work together on various projects or activities together. We both also still do our own thing apart from each other.

We share similar views on family, money, sex, etc. and have discussed life goals and hopes and dreams and seem to be on the same page for everything. We're both laid back and were raised in traditional families with traditional values. We're both slightly more liberal than our families, but ideas on how things should be linger for both of us. I know it's the 21st century and all, but neither one of us would be comfortable living together before being engaged. Huge /r/relationships faux-pas, I know.

I'm somewhere around his eighth girlfriend and fourth sexual partner. He's my third boyfriend (first since high school) and first sexual partner, if it matters.

Of course, I know all this wonderfulness is due in part to the honeymoon stage, but I'm also not sure how honeymoony we are, having been friends first and spending most of our free time together for about a year.


**The Development**

We're both from the same city. We each moved away for university and back to our home town for work when we graduated (him in 2006 and me in 2011). He has a high-paying, high-demand job but is unsatisfied professionally. I have a low-paying, low-demand job that I enjoy thoroughly (albeit not with the company I currently work for).

After he and his previous girlfriend broke up, he began looking for a new career. He'd had a dream job in the back of his mind for more than two decades, but ended up pursuing his current job because of family pressure. Turns out, he hates what his father and brother do, and the recruiters he met with for the dream job think he'd be a good fit. Through a series of weird blips that have nothing to do with him, he won't be offered a job for at least another six months but has more or less been guaranteed a position by the end of 2014. The job will definitely take him away from our current city and possibly several hundred kilometres/miles away.

The new job will also be (relatively) high paying and high demand. 

I've obviously known about this since the start and support him in it fully. I would love for him to be satisfied and not get so down on himself about work. As our relationship has gotten more serious, we've had increasingly serious discussions about how I fit into this picture, and we have both said all along that we'd like me to go, too. That would almost definitely require me to live with him, since I make pretty measly cash - as you'll remember, a prerequisite to that for both of us is engagement. 

To be clear, as much as I enjoy aspects of my job and find it fulfilling, I'm pretty easy to please and pretty well qualified and I'm sure that with enough time and effort I can find something else satisfying. Also, if (when?) we begin a family, I expect (as does he) that I will be staying home to raise children, so my career will ultimately be taking a secondary role in my life.

In short, I don't feel like I'd be giving up a whole lot in the process.

**The Twist**

My company is pretty well-known for its ruthless business decisions. It strips its offices down to the bare minimum for staffing and then makes even more cuts. It's not a pleasant atmosphere, to say the least.

I got a note from my boss than I have to meet with him (for the first time since I was hired) and his boss (who I've never met) in a couple weeks. At the risk of sounding defeatist, there is no way this meeting is to tell me what a good job I'm doing. Best case scenario, they're telling me that they're restructuring and the nature of my job is going to be completely overhauled (maybe send me to part-time or amalgamate me with another department). The other equally-likely possibility is that I'm simply being fired.

Point of note: my company is, for all intents and purposes, the only one in a one-hour radius that employs my profession.

I know it's silly to be planning out what my reaction will be before it even happens, but I've had a couple days to consider and browse job postings both in my area and in other areas I'd consider living. I don't want to lose my job in two weeks and have to start from scratch then with updating my resume and everything else.

So, assuming I get fired, my game plan (boyfriend approved) is more or less to get a place holder job - something in retail or reception, for example - in this city until we find out about his job, and then move with him and then figure everything out from there. I'm pretty easy to please and I'm basically making minimum wage right now, so I don't think this would be a terrible thing. It might actually help me wrap my head around where I want to take my career (I've known for a while the answer is not forward with my current company).

**The Dilemma**

I guess the question is... Am I emotionally mature enough to be making the decision to put my career on hold before there's a formal commitment? I mean, we've obviously talked about it and timelines and everything and both believe our relationship is heading toward marriage - but that was still kind of an abstract idea. Now, I might be in a position to make a real-life decision based on our relationship (for the first time ever, for me), and while it *feels* right, I'm hoping to hear from some of the older-than-me Redditors. 

Basically, if I was 18 and typing all this out, I know the answer would be to put my schooling/career first and that I'm young and still have a lot of growing up to do - fair. But now, two years out of post-secondary and in a relationship with a full-fledged adult, I'm pretty sure I can responsibly make a decision like this.

Can I?

11563,Relationships,2y740m,"About a year ago my gf tells me how she was raped, probably date raped (didn't want to push it by asking further), and that she continued seeing him for about a year. He was having an affair. It's how she lost her virginity. She loved him.

I ask her if she cut him off from her life. She mentioned that she hates him and it's in the past.

So about a year ago, like many posts in this sub, she was in the shower and I noticed her phone had some messages so I just go and check like a douche, I know I know. 

I find an old chat, maybe two weeks old, and I do what I shouldn't have done - I read all of the chat that I could and found out it's the guy that raped her. They haven't talked in years but have sent some pleasantries here and there every few months.

I also figure out that he's in one of the small group pictures in her room.

So I know this is late but something reminded me of it recently and I just need to ask the internet community - if someone was raped and you supposedly absolutely hate that person, why are you still friends on FB, still kinda talk, and even have his image in your room? 

She claimed it's all in the past but I just can't shake this uneasy feeling, maybe it's all just me. It makes me uncomfortable he's still there even though she said it was in the past.

We had plans for the 4th that included having a cookout at his house with about 15 of our friends (his plans). I told him I'd love to see the fireworks since I've never been to them with him and there's a nice outlook near his house. I figured we could see our friends during the day and then see the fireworks later that night alone. 

He calls me the night before and asks if I want to go hiking instead of the cookout and then have the cookout later on, eliminating the fireworks altogether. I'm a little annoyed and wondering why he wants to. I ask who made these new plans and he tells me it's this girl, Alex. 

Now, I've always had a problem with this girl. She is an attention whore who gets really drunk and tries and fight our friends/is generally very high maintenance and a nuisance. She also openly flirts with my boyfriend (and really anyone). She has invited him over alone for dinner with her family. She's told people she hates me when I've always been nothing but nice to her despite my real feelings about her. Anyway, one night she tried to kiss my boyfriend and according to him, nothing happened. A few others were there and confirmed that nothing did.

When we got back together, my one request was that we would have nothing to do with her. For me, she is nothing but trouble, she doesn't like OR respect me, and she has shady intentions. He agreed and said he wouldn't respond to her texts.

So, why go to something she planned? Because a few of his friends wanted to go and he didn't want to be left out. And they invited him. I told him I absolutely wouldn't be attending something she planned because I don't want to spend my holiday around a bad person when I can easily avoid it. He told me we would avoid her and not talk to her. To me, that's rude since they are her plans and I don't want to have to ignore her. I told him how strongly I was against the plans. I don't want to be controlling but I can't budge on this one, as I don't trust her and I felt he wasn't respecting my feelings. I told him that if he went, it would put our relationship on the rocks.

Aaaand he ended up going. We fought on the phone that morning, and I ended up going out with other friends and turning off my phone. I was furious that he didn't care about the plans that we (and 15 other people) had already made, and blew them off. And didn't care about my feelings towards the situation. So in my state of fury, I asked him to text her tonight and tell her that he could no longer be friends with her so it was clear to her instead of ignoring her. He said it's too awkward and he doesn't like confrontation. I'm at the end of my rope. He is a coward.

Some context: My GF moved out here to California about 2 years ago. After the first night I slept over at her place after a night of clubbing (2nd time we hooked up) she asked me to jump out of her window because her roommate knew her boyfriend from Florida. Before this moment, she had never informed me that she had a boyfriend. (Also, I did not jump out the window).

11577,Dating,3a7zxa,"I've only recently started actually dating and trying relationships (before I was 20 I hated myself and didn't think I would ever find anyone to like me so I just slept around a lot). When I started things I was just happy to be hanging out with people who liked me and dating, but at this point I don't care for that. Now I feel that i want to find one person to share my whole life with and that's who i'm looking for. Casual sex isn't fun anymore, I want it to mean something.

So I've had a couple serious relationships, and they have all(3 so far, maybe 4) seem to come to a head with him saying something along the lines of: I don't feel that I'm giving you enough time, Do you think I'm a bad boyfriend?, You could find someone to give you anything you want and I can't which to me sounds like they don't think they're good enough for me.

I think this comes from the fact that I am a very understanding and casual person. I don't get upset often. I think I'm really easy to talk to and a good listener. I have opinions but I don't shove them down anyone's throats. I am very swayable on topics I don't know or care about. For example if I'm talking about soccer to someone who plays and I say something and they tell me I'm wrong and explain I'll agree without argument because I trust that they know more than me. I don't ask for money, I pay for things just as much if not more than the guys do (I'm not counting, but I make a good living compared to most my age and don't mind putting in a bit extra), and I love giving gifts and making people happy. Not huge things, just little cute things I think they'll like, usually it was free to me. I came from a super manipulative and abusive family and I can't stand fighting for no reason and arguing illogically so I try my best not to do it. Guys have told me to have my own opinion before, but I do! It's just usually an agreeable one, haha.

So when my bfs have said things like what i said above they seem to want to break up shortly later, citing reasons like I mentioned. I refuse to argue with someone breaking up with me. I feel that if that's what they want then the decision is done and I don't want to change their mind anyway because it would be like living a lie. In my last break up he(D) explained that he didn't feel he was giving me enough time and I said that to me that's like saying you don't have enough money to spend on me which I don't care about, all I want is for you to give what you can and respect me. I didn't say this trying to change anything, I just wanted to speak my mind about why I didn't think that was a very good reason to break up. I said that I don't agree with his reasons though i understand where he's coming from and I wanted him to do whatever makes him happy. We remained friends (he's the only ex that didn't turn on me on the break up and start hating me) but I have a nagging feeling that it's me causing this to happen and saying I'm too good for them is just an easy way out. I felt this way when D was breaking up with me too and I asked him after he said he didn't have time if it really wasn't something I did and he adamantly said no and explained his reasoning about not having enough time further. I do understand where he's coming from, but like I said I still have a feeling I'm doing something wrong...

Here's what relationships have been like for me: Meet, attraction, hang out more, sex, hang out a lot more and do everything together, he's tired and doesn't want to have sex or see me as much (I have a high libido), he stops respecting me, he breaks up.

I'm very indiscriminate. I don't care how people look as long as they take care, same with their job and lives in general. I've been told before by others that i could do better with my choices as far as desirability goes, but I don't feel that way. I feel like if a guy sees something special in me I should give him a chance to show me what's special about him. Sure this has me meeting some weirdos, but also some wonderful people. I try to be kind to everyone all the time and especially to my bf. I am super loyal and feel that if we're calling each other bf/gf then we should be there for each other and have each other backs. I admit that D was the first of these relationships that I really strongly felt this with, but even in the previous relationships where the guy was less loyal and appreciative I still put forth my all in hopes that it would help him and make life easier for everyone. I agree that this was silly and I should be more selfish and know what i want. D was not like that, I felt we were both doing the best we could, though i was able to put in more because of his hectic job. I was happy doing this because I enjoy being with him. He mentioned that he didn't want me to resent him for not spending enough time on me and said I don't and I understand. My life gets busy too, plus I have a super demanding family to tend to.

Some other poor qualities I have are having a crazy crazy asian family that tries very hard to control my life, a demanding job, a family business I have to tend to, my body is wrecked from being an obese child/teen (I look pretty good with clothes on but when they come off  :( ), I cry very easy, I have depression and anxiety (this is something I keep to myself because I've never been serious enough to be comfortable to share. Same goes for details of my shitty childhood), i smoke a lot of weed (at least once a day). I don't really think most of these come up, though, besides catering plans to my family and being a bit self conscious about my body. I also love sex and want to have a lot of it which is good or bad depending on who you ask.

Sorry, I'm rambling now.

My question is based on everything I said, do you think i'm doing something to push men away? I'd be happy to give more details if they'll help.

Thank you!

11578,Relationships,33axcn,"Been together 13 months, and live together, moved in at the start of March (almost 2 months). All we do is fight. About everything.  We don't have sex. I want to have sex, and she doesn't.  We have completely opposite views on sex. She sees it nagatively and hates it. I don't. I want us to work. I get grumpy or sad about not having sex. That pisses her off. Rinse and repeat. I try to keep it to myself, but I'm not good at it. 

She is currently finishing up an associates degree and works 2 jobs. She is also on Chantix and has clinical depression. She is not getting any treatment. She doesn't like antipressants and doesn't like therapists more. She says she has it completely under control. 

She probably on average puts a lot more time into work and school than I do. I say on average because her second job is an on-call job, she could work 2-nights some weeks and nothing other weeks. 

I have a bachelor's and work a full time job. I'm out of the house for 9.5 hours a day, M-F. 

She is stressed out all of the time. Most of what she says to me is complaining about work, school, etc. She hardly asks about me, how my day was etc.

75% of our conversations revolve around me asking her about her day, her complaining, than me saying 'that sucks', offering advice if she request it, agreeing with her that something was stupid/wrong, or any combination. Sometimes it's different.  

I also feel like I do all of the work around our apartment. I cook meals, I clean all of the dishes (not just the ones I make, but the ones she leaves laying around too). I do all of the laundry, I picked up after her (snack wrappers, bottles, clothes, dishes, etc.)

I feel unappreciated and unattractive. I rarely get complimented or asked about my day. I don't get much affection (no kissing other than pecks.) We do cuddle and hold hands.  So there is some affection. 

In the past when we argued about sex, she said she hates it, one time she said she would be okay with never having sex agian. She also said that she gets all the physical affection she needs from cuddling. On top of this, she has a low libido. 

On the lighter side of things, she has stated that she wants to change and wants to have a sex life with me. She says she still finds me attractive, but my timing is wrong all the time. Also my mood doesn't do it for her. Also, when. I say she is sexy or attractive,  that upsets her. 

We used to have sex. A lot. I'm not sure what changed, but it's not me. 

I was thinking it could be the affect of the chantix, but this has been going on longer than she's been on that. 

I would say that she doesn't deal with stress well and that is why we don't do it. Stress shuts down her sex drive? 

We've done it 3-4 times this year, in 4 months. I don't just want to 'fuck', I want everything that comes with it, the emotional bond, the closeness. She doesn't see it this way. 

I haven't been the best I can be in this situation either. I get sad and upset about it. Like when we have a wonderful and all I want to do is be with her physically and she rejects me... it hurts. And she sees it, she knows. And it upsets her, she gets angry so angry at me being sad. 

We didn't even have sex on Valentine's day or our Anniversary dispite it being a wonderful time otherwise. 

I know that she loves. I know it's true love. I know. She is just stressed. 

Lately in our fights, she keeps telling me to leave the relationship if I don't like it. Is this her telling me that she wants me to break up with her?

4 months ago I picked out a beautiful ring for her and now this is happening. 

I just want an outside opinion. I feel like no one understands me right now. 

More about me because I feel like I'm blaming her for everything:

I've been sad about the no sex a lot lately which isn't helping the relationship. I have also been grumpy. I don't lash out with my anger like my GF, instead I just keep quiet and I'm short when we talk. This upsets her. 

I'm not physically attractive, I'm not in shape, but I'm not fat either -175lbs, 5'11 and I have an unattractive face. GF is very attractive. I'm waaay out of league. 

I haven't been doing the little things nearly as much as I used to- writing notes, buying her sweets/jelewery/gifts etc. I guess that's because I haven't been 'feeling it'. 

I have also been giving her massages way less often because it turns me on. 
I also want to say that she has put more of an effort in lately with housework.

We have talked throughly about these problems and nothing has helped.

11582,Relationships,2tm2gv,"When my fiance and I started dating I was about 230 lbs with broad shoulders and a buzz cut. As I entered the work force, I decided to make a change to my appearance by working out 5 times a week and growing my hair out to a Mad Men side part. I am now down to about 195 lbs and, even though I have ways to go, I am in my best shape ever and am very happy with how I look in the mirror. 

My fiance loves my improvement and agrees that I look better than ever, but she has expressed that I have worked myself out of her league. She has said that people must look at us and wonder why I am with her (like you look at a young model with an old man).

Now, I have to admit that I was initially flattered by this, especially since I care about her opinion of my appearance over anyone else. But, when she said it again, I started to get concerned. I personally do not think that I am out of her league and really think that I am just catching up to her. 

She has always had self-image issues even though she is a beautiful girl, inside and out. The advice that I have seen on here (like keeping up the genuine compliments) don't really stick because she usually thinks that I'm just being a nice boyfriend and that I would think she is hot even if she was 200 lbs. 

My main concern is that she is going to convince me that I am actually out of her league. Again, I feel like I am just trying to keep up with her. But since I value her opinion above all, I am afraid that I am starting to believe it and that makes me feel like an awful SO. I love feeling more attractive, but I do not want it to my fiance to think that everyone is asking why I am going out with her.

Is there a way that I can approach this besides the token just communicate how you feel with her advice since I've been trying that with fail?

11583,Relationships,1ixkvr,"So I've been living with a good friend (friends for 7 years) of mine for a couple of months now, and for the most part the situation has worked out well, but lately I've run into some issues with his girlfriend.

My roommate (Jake) has been dating his girlfriend (Lisa) for about 3 months now. They haven't known each other for very long, maybe 4 months at most. Jake has a job that requires him to work early mornings and Lisa has a job that requires her to work mostly nights (until 11 or 12) though she does have lots of days off. I work shift work. About every other day (or more) she comes here after work around midnight and her and Jake go to bed. Jake is gone for work by 6am and she stays in his room to sleep in. Now, I either work early in the morning around 8am or late afternoon around 4pm. When I work in the morning I'm left tip-toeing around my own apartment while getting ready for work because I don't want to wake her. She is then left alone in my house until whenever she sees fit. If I work late or have a day off, then I'm stuck in the house with her, either trying to not wake her up or awkwardly spending time with her when I look forward to that time alone.

For the most part I was ignoring it all. Ignored the fact that Jake was lending Lisa a key so she could come get her stuff if he was working, ignored her shit all over the bathroom and ignored her in general. I have mentioned to him that I'm uncomfortable having her here if neither of us are here, but he just blows me off and says she doesn't do anything. But today Jake tells me that he's given Lisa a key to the apartment. He had made a copy and given it to her without even telling me. I was kind of shocked. All I could really say was.Don't you think that's something you should have discussed with me? And he said well were you gonna say no? And I said I'm not sure. I've told you that I don't want her here if you're not here and in that case she wouldn't need a key.

I think I am most bothered because I feel like she is really just living here rent-free. She lives at home and so if her and Jake want to stay together she must come here. She basically comes here at night to shower, eat and sleep, and then leaves in the morning sometime after Jake leaves. That seems like a second roommate to me.

Am I being irrational about this? What should I say to Jake, and how can I go about it without making it sound like I hate his girlfriend?

TL;DR: My roommate's girlfriend seems to be overstaying her welcome and I'm not sure how to approach him about it again.

We met 3 months ago, and although I found him attractive--both physically and intellectually--I was hesitate to do anything romantic with him due to the fact that he would be graduating this spring. He had also mentioned during our first night out he recently came out of a relationship. However, he was completely enamored with me and always wanted to kiss me and hang out with me. After 3 dates of him displaying romantic behavior, I decided to reciprocate and it felt like a boyfriend/girlfriend dynamic for about two months, where we got intimate, kissed before parting ways, bringing him baked goods, and visiting him every Sunday night at his place. 

Last week, I was invited to a couples night with my friends and their SOs, so naturally I asked him if he would be interested in going together. He looked at me weirdly and told me that he doesn't have any romantic feelings for me, which absolutely devastated me. I know I shouldn't have done this, but I got frustrated while starting to cry and asked what kind of relationship we were in, where he replied, I don't know how to define it. I knew that the relationship wouldn't get serious, but he seemed so romantically attached. He told me that because he thought we were friends the entire time, the relationship wouldn't change even though I realized that we weren't going out.

Considering that I was blindly believing that we casually dating for the past two months, I don't know what to do next. He claims that he made it clear that he wasn't looking for anything serious in the beginning, but I felt like because he treated me like his girlfriend, I assumed that those feelings evaporated as we saw each other more.

It was awesome while it lasted, however, when it ended (it was my fault), it sucked (a lot) and I decided that it'd be better to be singl.e  For the first year or so I still dated frequently and had sex regularly.  Then after that, I had 3 dark years where I rarely had sex, dated, and just overall felt lonely.  

During this time I grew exponentially in a lot of things - all of which was too attract women. In doing this, I found new things I liked (and can no longer live without i.e my current profession and meditation to name a couple) focused on uplifting me, and kept going to the grinder that was the dating game.  I would just talk to girls (I was part of the whole PUA kind've lifestyle which regressed as the  years went by) and overall just loved learned to love being single.

Eventually my life started to change.  I began dating a ton more and then found myself involved with a many women in the final two year.  I reached the point of the what are we conversations quite a few times during this span and found myself letting girls go countless times.  I didn't want to be tied down.  I did not want to lose the ability flirt with the cute girl at the register at whatever store I was in.  I enjoyed going to the bars and flirting with that new girl that just joined my social circle.  I was getting good with women, I was confident, my head was clear, and I loved my life.

Then I met this girl I am talking too now.  I see us slipping into a relationship steadily.  I feel like I can't afford to let this girl go.  She's awesome, may be too young for me, but is bright, full of energy, and unique.  She is kind but confident and forceful.  She's so much fun to be around, the sex is amazing, and overall just so right.  Before with other women I'd date and wouldn't care whether she'd stick around or not - I always met another.  But for the first time I would hate to see her date someone else.

  I want to make it official for the first time in forever...but I am afraid of losing my independence.  (I had planned trips to France and Korea to visit past flings...but those cannot happen any longer).  I'm afraid I will not grow when I'm with her.  I hate how social media has made bf/gfs into mini celebrities.  I dislike the amount of money, time, and emotion that go into it.  I hate how emotions skews so many personal decisions.

11591,Relationships,293w3e,"We've been dating online, and things have been for the most part great.

The root cause of the issue I'm having actually stems from something that happened about 6 months into the relationship. I purchased her a plane ticket, having discussed it thoroughly between the two of us. But she neglected to make certain her parents would be okay with her flying across the country to get to me. Which as it turns out, they were not. She had to cancel the meet an hour before she left the house to get to the plane. I was upset, and reacted extremely poorly.

We recovered (or, I did at least. I feel very childish for having been upset to that degree when it was incredibly obvious she shouldn't be coming), but had a few incidents where we were uncertain of whether the relationship could continue, especially when I was asked out by someone unaware of my relationship status. I nearly accepted, but decided that I wanted to make my current relationship work out.

A few months later and the anniversary rolls around. She waits a few days, then breaks up with me for a day (for what I believe to be another guy, as he was going to spend the night with her soon) before (maybe out of guilt) we got back together. For a few months I was very on edge about all of this, but a visit to her place that was wonderful erased those feelings for the most part, and I think about it very little.

Now I'm here. I'm about to pull the trigger on another visit for the summer, to celebrate her birthday, but I need an outside perspective on whether this is a good idea.

Part of it is because we paid for a ticket reschedule that she could use to come here. Which she has been afraid to ask her parents about, and finally just gave up and offered to pay me back, despite a lot of encouragement and reassurance. My reaction/her fear of a no/her fear of flying/general uneasiness combined to make her freeze up.

My other hesitation is that I'm not going on my own dime this time. My retired grandmother is planning to pay, after hugely spoiling me on high school graduation, and I don't want her to keep throwing away retirement money she might need at some point on an expensive relationship.

I feel like I trust her, as she's basically turned her life around and started to work on her degree and job again, but the concerns of my family members prompt me to think about this again, and they want me to ask her point-blank if she's serious about this.

I'm just having some trouble with thinking this through, with the rest of the stuff on my plate today.

11593,Breakups,1osqrz,"I had a wonderful relationship going at school with the girl of my dreams. Everything was perfect, the chemistry was top notch, and we were basically partners in crime. She was a year behind me, and I graduated. Graduation moved me four hours away from her, and my job moved me another half hour further so we saw our relationship turn into long distance. We had been dating five months at that point (long for me).

This was problematic for a variety of reasons:

1. She has no car.
2. She is incredibly busy.
3. Her parents pressure her to stay single due to her personal struggles, so I was kept a secret from them.

We would text constantly, call and Skype chat often enough, but then things started to decline in the summer. Every time we would set up a weekend for me to visit, something would happen that ruins it for us (95% of the time, on her end). After a summer of missed connections, we finally had the perfect weekend at the end of July...and my car's engine blows up on the way there.

This caused her to freak out and dump me, but for some reason she still expects us to stay mutually exclusive. I ended up going on a couple (of bad) dates, but was still hung up on her. We kept in contact, and still tried to see each other.

Every time I pressed to see her, I met a WALL of resistance which confused and infuriated me. She told me she was helpless, too busy, was struggling with personal demons, and every other excuse. She said she didn't know if it was a good idea, since the distance would probably always be there. 

She told me that if I really loved her, I could wait for her to be less busy.

Wait I did, for months. The fights continued, harsh words were thrown, and we always made up. Now it's October and I met a local girl who is probably the complete opposite of my ex, but the chemistry is there. We have been going on dates and are ready to make it official.

This did not fly with my ex. She went on the warpath, attacking me with very harsh and personal insults. When I fought back she would play the victim and try to make me feel guilty. She said I betrayed her, that I never loved her because I couldn't wait.

But I waited six months for her! Isn't that long enough?

That's not the kicker, after that she tells me she is free next weekend and urges me to go. I decline, and she immediately goes on a date with some guy...**that night!**

I was hurt, infuriated, and frustrated. She told me I deserved it because I did the same thing to her by starting something with a new girl.

What the fuck.

She says that she broke up with me so that we could possibly have a future together, and have a normal relationship when she graduates and we might live a lot closer.  She said that she still loves me and cares about me more than anyone else, but that sure seems like a lie at this point.  I'm not sure if I can have a future with her after this. I'm starting to hate her, just because of how poorly she handled the situation, and how little respect and care for me that she showed.

TL;DR LD Girlfriend of almost a year, broke up with me almost out of the blue after not feeling it any more for about two weeks, with no effort to change that. ",My girlfriend [17 F] just dumped Me [19 M] almost out of the blue and I'm just lost. [Breakup],0.0,False,0.0,3.0,1379340341.0,/r/relationships/comments/1mi1qc/my_girlfriend_17_f_just_dumped_me_19_m_almost_out/,Romantic
11595,Breakups,276eru,"Sorry in advance if this becomes a wall of text, I'll try to make the TLDR as tolerable as I can haha. Throwaway for obvious reasons, and I'll start with some background:

My ex-gf and I live in the same state, but on the other side of each other. We were dating just shy of a year, with both of us having been naturally clingy to each other (which I liked, it gave me a break in worry in the LDR). She lives about a 6+ hour drive from me, so I only see her every so often during school breaks. I've met her whole family and she's met mine, our divorced mothers have met each other. We were really what some people considered the ideal couple in many instances and then suddenly... a build up of arguments led to one another and we broke up.

This all caught me off guard; and it started off with her needing a couple days break from our relationship. I thought, Fine, maybe it's good for both of us (not that I actually wanted it). I already had exams coming up and progression in a varsity sport and had enough on my plate. I have some familial issues at home, but nothing extremely severe that's worth mentioning as of now. However, my cancer had come back (nothing fatal as of yet, but of high concern to my doctors, long story but basically, I'm okay but treatment is raping me).

After a couple days within the break, I said I had it and that we needed to talk. This led to a very heated argument that she made sound like I initiated, with me sending her basically an essay over text on how a break seemed unnecessary in a long-distance relationship. Not only that, but I felt like she had basically taken advantage of my trust. By this, I mean that we had our promises in our relationship, and during her break she had decided to break them all. Specifically, she told me she needed this break to go focus on school, etc, but scrolling through social media (twitter/instagram/tumblr) I found out she'd gone out to smoke weed with some friends and literally just used that weekend to go fuck around. 

One of our promises was to not smoke weed away from each other. We both get too... touchy. Physically. I felt betrayed at this point, and that's when I felt the need to talk to her.

Post-argument, I think we had calmed down a tiny bit (this was last week, forgive me my memory is foggy and it's hard to remember the details), I asked her if she had ever thought of breaking up with me.

Mistake 1.

She said that she had recently, and I asked her if she still did. This caused a long pause (we had been texting each other at the speed of a normal conversation), and she finally replied with I need a day. Can you give me that?

Reluctantly, I agreed to give her her time needed to think. 
The next day, around 10PM, I receive a wall of text from her. 
TLDR: The break up would be best, the relationship is toxic, etc etc and in the end, she claims she wants to remain best friends.

I asked her again if that was what she really wanted (we had invested a lot into this relationship for some highschoolers.... a LOT...)

Mistake Dos.

After constant arguing between where our relationship was headed, we ended up breaking up. I was in a state of denial at this point, not knowing how to react. I was... in shock? I didn't expect this to happen. I was in grief and overwhelmed by everything else on my mind, from school to sports, to my cancer treatments... and I just bawled on my desk for a good bit until I hit an emotional block.

We actually talked for a good bit, a couple days. 1-2? And that's when things turned sour. . . again. 

I'm actually extremely unfamiliar with the last few days. But just a physical recap: My cancer has flared again so I've been undergoing heavier treatment. My mother doesn't exactly know I have cancer, my father is paying for it and taking responsibility over it, it's a difficult situation to explain, and my arthritis is stacked on top of this (in my knees.) I've also been sleeping at 5AM for the past 2 weeks just from the total built up stress, and the break up occurred last week, on the 28th?


Just before this next story, I asked her again, Do you actually want to stay best friends with me? Or was that just a proposal to make things easier on you?

Word for word, her reponse was: I actually do... you are and always were one of my bestest friends and one of the greatest friends i have. I cant just lose someone like you, you know?

I replied with I couldn't take that text seriously after, bestest, but yeah I guess haha; I was just wondering.

bestest best.


So heading into finals week now, yesterday I found my long lost wallet. I mentioned it to my ex, and I texted her Holy shit, look what I found trying to have a casual conversation. She replies with a simple ? and I sent her a picture it's my wallet. Yeah... where was it? In my brothers fucking bag. So not only am I now dealing with some physical constraints, but I feel betrayed by someone from my own family. Great. 

What... why was it in there LOL

That reply made me question if she was even sober. I felt betrayed again once the idea of her being high came up, and I asked Can you not use some common sense

Maybe you put it in there idk

I don't understand what goes on through a person's mind when I tell them I found a wallet I lost months ago in someone else's bag. (Sorry if this sounds off topic, it'll make sense.)

I lost it months ago. Are you serious right now? Sometimes I can't even tell who's side you're on or what's going on in your head.

Mistake Troi.

From there on, she never replied to me.

That was yesterday evening, and I've sent her 2 texts after that. I know she has her phone with me and I know for a fact she saw those texts because she's been on instagram and on twitter through her phone. The texts I sent her were to sleep well and feel better (respectively, 2 separate texts) because she had again made some questionable decisions. Her twitter had stated that she had almost died on the highway last night when her car stopped twice, her next tweet saying she kind of wished she did.

This all makes me feel terrible, I still haven't slept before 5AM, my cancer is stabilizing but not getting better, my arthritis is straight up fucking me up the ass, I'm stressed from academics, my brother betrayed me (whom I was really close to), and worst of all

She's coming to my apartment in 3 weeks. She had already agreed with my mom (the tickets were already bought for her flight) to help make sure my brother and I survive a couple weeks without my mom. Basically, he'll be needing rides to summer school, while her and I go do whatever. At least, that was the old plan.

However with things the way they are, I have no clue what's going to happen and I'm too anxious to hold this in for 3 more weeks.

What do I do :(?

---   
**TL;DR**: Broke up with my ex, cancer and arthritis flared up again, can't trust brother, school + stress in general sucks, ex-gf who wanted to be best friends stopped texting me and she's still coming over for summer break in 3 weeks. What the fuck do I do?



***EDIT 1***: She texted me out of the fucking blue a bit into last night. Make a playlist of Chef John (Food Wishes) videos of food you want to eat when I come over.

I replied with a well hi to you too. After an extremely brief introduction, I was a bit hesitant on bothering to talk to her. I was angry, confused, and emotional. Trying to keep my head on right, I asked her You ask me this all after ignoring me for a day? Basically I asked her what was her problem.

Long story short, she apologized about acting irrationally the night before because she was angry at me for responding to her in an unnecessarily angry tone. Okay yeah, bull shit.

Either way, she apologized... but something changed. We had a legitimate conversation and it was actually nice. I wasn't completely pissed at her for once. 

After talking for a while, I thought about something. Our relationship had collapsed on nothing; and I had wondered if it were her birth control patch that had caused it. I read that hormonal birth control can affect things like this, and wondered. Does this seem like a viable possibility?

I'm only asking this because she was the one who had originally hoped for so much in this relationship, from talking about the future and wanting more out of what we already had, then I got hit like a fucking truck speeding on the freeway and things ended. 

She promised that when she comes over, we can talk about it in a more/less unbiased view. I'm not sure. But I feel a lot better.

11603,Relationships,2d7v9g,"When my husband and I first got together, for the first month we couldn't keep our hands off each other. Our record was four times in a day. I know the exact time that all changed- the night of my 25th birthday. We had gone out for drinks with friends, and when we got back to his apartment, he apologized that he was too drunk for sex, which I was fine with. The next morning, I began to initiate, and he claimed he was still too tired, so we slept a bit more, and I then initiated again, and he made the excuse that he didn't have a condom. I offered to suck his cock, or give him a hand job. Again, no, and he removed my hand from him pretty firmly, and then left the room. Needless to say I was bewildered and hurt from his rejection. Little did I know this would become the norm.


Most probably would've walked away in the beginning, but I was sure that I was in love for the first time in my life, I connected with him more than I had any man, and thought that we could work through this hurdle, that I just had to show my loyalty and devotion (all of his previous girlfriends had cheated on him.)


We moved in together, we bought a house, we got engaged…all the while with me trying everything I could to get him interested in having sex, only to have my efforts rejected, sometimes angrily. I begged, I yelled, I suggested counseling, I cried, and cried, and cried. It would get to the point where I was despondent, and obviously thinking of leaving, and then he would suddenly make an effort again. We would have sex- just enough to where I would think we were becoming a 'normal' couple- and then old patterns would resume. His mantra was always, We'll get through this.


We got married, and he got me pregnant right away. He didn't touch me for the next year after that. When our daughter was just over a year old, I was sure I'd had enough, and gave him the ultimatum that things would have to change or I was leaving for good. Truthfully, I had one foot out the door. The first time we had sex shortly after that, I unexpectedly became pregnant again with our son. I felt stuck, obligated to stay, and he promised that things would be better. We'll get through this. Again, was not touched during the whole pregnancy or after. 


When our son was three months old, I accidentally logged on to his Facebook account, and in his messages was conversations of a flirtatious nature with a woman that he'd slept before he and I had met. She had sent pictures of her tits, and he had sent her shots of his dick. I was enraged, humiliated, confused, and extremely heartbroken. I confronted him angrily. He cried, and professed to being an idiot, that he would do absolutely anything not to lose his family, that he didn't know what was wrong with him. I should have left, but I was chicken-shit. I'm a stay at home mom, with two little kids, I live in a nice house. Despite all of our disfunction sexually, the husband and I are still good friends to each other. So I stayed. It was a dark time, and things slowly got better- or at least back to our 'normal'. But there was a definite shift. I stopped fighting for sex. He began to initiate for it, but only every four months or so.


Which brings us to present day, three years after the Facebook incident. I recently came to the epiphany that I can't depend on him for my happiness, that I have to make my own. I've begun working out, after years of eating my feelings and gaining a lot of weight. I've been going out frequently, by myself and with friends. Other men pay me attention, and find me attractive. This has all boosted my confidence considerably, but, I still seek the attention of my husband. I have come to the realization though, that I'm not attracted to him sexually at all anymore. In the infrequent times we have had sex, I can't come. I can't bring myself to kiss him at all. I've told him all of this honestly, and all he responds with is, We'll get through this. I told him how I carry so much resentment from all the years he rejected me, and he tells me I need to stop living in the past, that things have gotten better. 

I fantasize about other men. I want to ask him for an open relationship, and have in the past, but he's never and will never agree to it, because in a fucked up way, while he doesn't seem to want me, no one else is allowed to have me either. I still feel trapped. I don't want to divorce and blow apart my young children's lives, who adore their dad, but I also don't want to live like this anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice or perspective would be appreciated.

I told my girlfriend that there would be times when I might take on contracts on the side like this when we first started dating.

Two years later, eleven months into a long distance relationship (him: LA, me: NYC), he confessed he gets tempted a lot. It made me upset to the point of not eating. Yes, it is mostly because of a deep seated insecurity I have of my body, but other factors such as his being in LA, all good-looking with so much sexual appeal, does nothing to appease me. I have already signed up for therapy and it starts on Feb. But in the mean time, I'm still finding it hard to deal. Like today, I visited /r/gonewild randomly and saw such beautiful bodied women whom I can never compare to. I keep imagining him sleeping with voluptuous women, and then being disappointed with my body on the few times we make love.

I don't want to bring this up with my boyfriend directly because a) he gets defensive, b) I still haven't figured out a level-headed way of doing so, because c) mentioning everything from my insecurities to the suspicion makes me sound like somebody I don't want to be.

My question is, should I deal with this myself or discuss it? And if I do, what's a non-accusatory(?) way to do that? I'm thinking of starting with asking him, Babe, are you finding LDR physically difficult?--are we gonna have problems in that aspect? Can anyone suggest anything better?

It has been mentioned occasionally during our relationship about whether this is a serious, long term thing and we both agreed that it is. I blurt out 'jokes' about us getting married because its been on my mind a lot lately and he doesn't freak out but lately he also jokes about 'putting a ring on it' etc.


I am wondering if this means its on his mind seriously too, ie is he considering proposing sometime in the not-too-distant future. Or if i'm making something out of nothing. Help!

11607,Relationships,1grw4t,"        Well we were basically the classic couple. We had been together for months and had been really close (best friends) for around a year. We live 450 miles apart, but certainly have met each other and we talked over the phone constantly.

        However, over a month ago, her sister died. After the event, I still was able to talk to her maybe once a day. About a week in, I stopped hearing from her though. On top of all this, I had a flight planned to visit her (she knew about it) which would have left Memorial Day. A week before, I texted her mom explaining that I haven't heard from her, but would be glad to still come up and help in any way and show my support. No response.

        That night, I called my SO (I had every night since as well) but this time the call was declined and she texted me saying just stop please. Nothing more. Before that, her last text was about how great I am and how much she loved me, so I was really confused (it was like a week before hand).

        I cancelled the flight and just thinking that she would have been in my arms is enough to bring a tear to my eye. I miss her more than anything. I have hardly attempted to contact her since she told me to stop, but it's so hard to just sit by and not know how she's doing, and not being able to be there for support. 

        So I hadn't heard from her for weeks. The last text I sent her was like a week ago. But tonight, once I passed my lifeguard test and everything and was excited, I sent her a text saying I got certified as a lifeguard today! I wish I were with you to share the excitement though. I hope you're doing alright. Let me know if you need anything. I love you I saw that she began to text a response but stopped (through iMessage) so I called her.

        She did not answer, but texted back I'm proud of you. I responded quickly with You're there?!?!? Please let me know what's going on. I'm so worried. Please please please then after no response, I texted I just want to know that you're alright. If you want to break up with me or anything, just tell me. I miss you so much though. I love you Katie.

        She is not responding. It really just pains me to think about the whole situation. I don't know if I'm still in a relationship or not (I want to be with her) or if I'm the only one she's ignoring. I feel like I am. I feel awful though. I really just want to be there for her.

        I also sent her a package with a card and a couple of gifts last week. She never mentioned it. I'm so confused. I still love her and can or just forget about her or anything, and the anxiety is building. I really don't know what to do.

        I completely understand that I probably sound like a typical 17 year old whining about a girl, but hey, you remember what that's like, right? I just need some advice or consolation or something.

The moments before midnight she walks out of the bar with him. The countdown happens as I'm frantically searching for her. We walk outside and my brother said they were walking down the street I ran over and saw they were a football field away. I yell fuck you! and walked back to get my friend to go down and confront this guy, along with the fact I was afraid of what I would do.


We can't find her anywhere. 


20 min later I finally call her and she sounds so fucked up. Barely able to speak.


Ultimately instead of a New Years kiss I got a nightmare. She apparently had sex with this guy in the back seat of his car. She remembers walking with him and kissing him. 

He texted her the next morning because he got her number at some point. That is when she found out they slept together. She went to the walk-in clinic and got an STD panel, drug panel and Plan B just in case.


She has apologized through and through. This isn't like her. She has spent all day sick and crying and wondering how she could have done it. 


She has been up front and honest. Saying it is the most f*%#* up thing she's ever done.

11609,Relationships,1fyttw,"Throwaway because I have some family redditors. Also, apologies for the massive wall of text.

So I (22F) just moved back in with my parents so that I can get their house ready to be sold. They plan to downgrade into something more manageable, since my mom works full-time and my dad has early-onset dementia. So here I come, fresh out of college to expedite the process while I job hunt.


My Uncle “Vernon” (56M) moved in here about a year ago. He needed a place because he was jobless and my parents have a furnished ‘apartment’ in the basement. The deal was, if he cooks (neither of my parents can) he can have reduced rent. My parents pay for the actual groceries – he just has to cook the meals. It’s been challenging because he’s ideologically a LOT different from my parents re: politics, religion, etc., and he likes to state his views, but for the most part everybody gets along.


Vernon also brought his daughter, Cassidy (16f). She was ‘hanging with the wrong crowd’ (details are vague) upstate and needed a fresh start. My parents are really committed to her and decided to stay in the house until she graduates high school so that she’d have a stable home. But Cassidy has this secret life that my parents don’t know about. Aside from the smoking, drinking and casual sex (with both genders) – there have been some MAJOR incidents that my parents don’t know about. Maybe six months ago, Cassidy thought she was pregnant. She wasn’t sure who the father was, ended up going to a party and getting blackout drunk. The next day she bled like crazy and miscarried. (When I asked her if she drank intentionally to miscarry, she said ‘I think subconsciously’. This girl.) Then last week, she comes into my room and tells me that she has a bench warrant out. Apparently she bought some pot from people she didn’t know and it was laced with something. She thought she was dying so she called the police on herself and was taken to the hospital. I don’t know at what point she was actually charged with drug use, but she has to get a court date to get it all sorted out. 


My parents don’t know about either of these incidents, let alone all of the other shit Cassidy gets up to. She is genuinely dumb, with both street and book smarts. What kills me is that (according to Cassidy) Vernon knows about both of these events – and *hasn’t done a damn thing*. And I mean that literally. She said that when he picked her up from the hospital, she didn’t even get an “I’m-disappointed-in-you” speech, let alone an actual lecture or discipline. Cassidy says to me, “I think he’s just given up. I think he just doesn’t want to be a parent anymore.” And she’s absolutely right. He just let it go – but first he said, ‘We’re not gonna tell [my mom]’. They told her the hospital visit was because of an anxiety attack.


This makes my blood boil. I feel like Vernon is a piece of shit. He gets this stable home where he can live with his daughter, and he doesn’t take responsibility for any of it. I think the only reason that he hides this stuff from my parents is because he doesn’t want to have difficult conversations. I also think my parents have made it clear that they are committed to helping take care of Cassidy – so if he’s not going to talk to her about this stuff, why not tell my parents, who would? I have a lot of problems with his ‘parenting’ but now that I know he’s conspiring with his daughter to keep secrets from my parents... this is an issue.


I hesitate to confess-all to my parents for a few reasons. Firstly, it would really, really upset them. My mom’s life is high-stress already and it's difficult for my dad to digest new information. The violation of trust is important to them and would seriously rock the boat for a while.

Secondly, I've always told Cassidy that she can be honest with me and trust me. If I tell her that I'm going to do something about it, she'll see it as betrayal. 

And thirdly... am I using this as an excuse to get Vernon kicked out? I really, really loathe this guy to the point where looking at him bothers me. He never cleans up his messes. He has an obsession with his ‘connections’ (owners of restaraunts, boats, etc.) and always talks about them. He has a history of (teen) porn addiction, which honestly makes me want to wear layers when I’m around him. He is extremely conservative, to the point of irrationality and hypocrisy. Our priorities and values are polar opposites, and even when he tries to be nice, it is obvious (I think) that I can’t stand him.


I don’t think I can see straight when it comes to Vernon – and now when I have this very relevant, important issue to deal with, I can’t be sure if I’m doing the right thing.


Do I tell my parents, upsetting everyone in the house and potentially resulting in someone moving out or at the very least making life very tense for while? I should also mention that Vernon lost his job last week, so moving out anytime soon seems less likely.

Do I keep the secret, allowing Vernon to do his own parenting thing and continue to avoid conflict that I am a third party to?

Do I confront Vernon and Cassidy, letting them know why I’m angry?

11611,Breakups,2sf286,"Hey!  Thanks in advance for reading this!  Its a bit longer than anticipated but that's the sum of it I think.  If there's anything else I forgot or you want me to clarify on, feel free to ask.

So for three years our relationship has been a flurry of utmost love, fights and in between recovering moments.  The fights have been horrible and I can no longer take it.  Not only would he insult me, he would tell me to leave, that he's going to kill our pets, that he wasted 3 years with me etc etc.  He has threatened to hurt me on multiple occasions as well.  I used to be violent as well, but I've calmed down a lot considerably and was working to improve a lot of things.  I think I've done great and am at a place where I was happy with myself.

However, it hasn't changed with him.  And I got sick of it.  Being told I should just do as he says and listen and not have any other suggestions, or do my own thing.  Things that weren't a problem before suddenly become something that is horribly wrong and needs to stop.  My interests are now childish and stupid.  My goals are never going to work out.  I'm a shitty person and he hates me.  So I left and moved into a friends place.  I'm taking this time for me, and he knows I'm pretty much at the end of my rope.  I don't know if he's trying to work on the things that caused me to leave, and it scares me.  Because I know that if I go back completely, it'll happen again and that's no way to have a relationship.  Not only that the breaking up will continue into engagement and marriage so i will never get that security I need to be happy, but the fights never change.  I am always the cause of his problems.  He's a little overweight?  That's my fault for not motivating him.  When I did try I got excuses. 

My friends know what happened and tells me to not go back because he's just being this way to make me go back to him.  That he's manipulative.  That he's going to do things to hurt my newfound friendships.  And they're scared for me.  But outside of leaving and suddenly doing a 180 in emotions as soon as somebody criticizes me or sternly talks to somebody else.  I truly do love him.  And I do want to go back because he won't do that to me, because I won't let him

I've been rereading his texts the night I left and they're calling me a cheater, telling me that it's over and that he never wants to see me again.  And they hurt, but they're the jist of our fights.  And I find myself not wanting to go back because it won't change.  I try to get him to improve himself and he wants to break up with me and sleep with somebody else.  I try to fix our relationship and he thinks we don't need it and wants to just leave me because I don't think he wants to put in the effort to fix this and make it last.

But because I love him, i want to go back.  I feel like I can't go back from here because too many people know and won't let me.  But I do want the future we planned. I want to believe it'll be different, but I can't get the fact that it might not out of my head.  They tell me it'll just get worse and that they're going to lose me as a friend.

Relationship wise, we've moved backwards.  From living together I'm living with a friend. From being common law were dating.  But this is for me to be a better, more responsible girlfriend, and hopefully he's going to work on the things that resulted in me leaving in the first place.

So my question is: is this relationship hopeless?  Am I just clinging to a dying thing?  Are they right?  Am I making a mistake like I believe I am?

I deserve better and I should love myself a bit more.  He's abusive.  And while he is whispering these sweet words, they're only sweet nothings. While I keep telling myself all of the good he has done for me (and there is more of that than the bad), the bad isn't worth it.

11612,Dating,2umg9h,"So I went out this weekend and didn't get too drunk and met this amazing woman called Jess, she's absolutely perfect, we danced for 4 hours and I don't mean dance as in the shuffle or some random drunk moves I mean we both knew how to dance and took it from there holding each other close and so forth.

Anywho, we had so much fun that when she went at the end of the night I completely forgot to ask for her number, however I have her friends number as my friend who was with me managed to get her friends number.

One of the problems is that Jess has a boyfriend, and I really can't get her out of my mind, I just want to have a conversation with her.

So my question is, how do I ask her best friend for her number. I feel that she maybe over protective and not do it as Jess has a boyfriend, all I want to do is talk and get to know Jess better but I'm just not sure how long to leave it and so forth.

11613,Dating,2jf7gv,"Jade and I have been friends for awhile now, through having a ton of mutual friends and going to school together last semester.  We typically have a really fun time when we all hang out, but Jade and I have never hung out alone.  After several months go by after our initial meeting, she asks me to hang out.  I decline, saying I'm too tired.  She proceeds to ask me to do things, as do I, but we continually decline each other for one reason or the other.  A few months go by, she starts to date a douchebag, and we stop talking and hanging.  

Those few months end, she is no longer with douchebag,  and she starts hitting me up to chill.  I decline her 4 times in a row.  I then ask her to hang twice and she bails both times. 

Now, flash to this past weekend.  We haven't seen eachother in awhile.  She is with my bestfriend (kenny) and some dude we don't know that she invited (ian).  The plan was to go say hi to all of our friends at a bar watching a sports game, and then leave and go to her best friends dorm(alice).  The bar was awesome.  I had fun seeing all of my friends.  She made a comment in front of everyone when I was eating wings about wondering what it's like if you kiss someone who is eating spicy foods.  I told her it's spicy, duh.

We leave the bar.  Now we're at Alice's dorm.  We start drinking and smoking having fun.  Kenny and I skate for a bit and I bite it hard bombing a hill in the rain.  She asks to see my wounds and whatnot.  Then we're all sitting around in a circle smoking and talking.  She is playing eye-spy with Ian.  She spied something green.  I knew she was talking about my eyes, (she has complemented me on them before) so I give her a glance and a flirty slight smirk.  Good times follow.  I am basically the center of the conversation and I'm making everyone laugh for hours.  

It's getting late.  Everyone goes for late night pizza, except Kenny and I stay back and skate.  They come back and we all get ready for bed.  I am sleeping in the living room on a chair while Jade and Ian are next to each other on two different couches.  Ian is nice and offers me the couch.  Jade and I are now very close to each other.  I make a joke how we are all going to dream about each other, and she gets really excited.  She demands that I hold her hand before we sleep and we will share the same dreams.  I oblige, and we hold hands for what seems like the longest 5-10 minutes of my life, until she lets go and apologizes.

Kenny and I are up early and we take Jades car for a spin to get coffee and some cough syrup before everyone wakes up.  Jade finds out and freaks a little.  When we get back she is upset that I haven't apologized.  I shrug it off and let her borrow my bowl to smoke.  She goes with Alice to Alice's bedroom to talk.  I knock on the door 5 minutes later and give her the cutest, puppy-eyed, heartfilled, apology ever.  They immediately invite me to sit down and smoke.  

Eventually Kenny and Ian join us and we are all laughing and having a really good time again.  Kenny and I are tripping hard, but we blame our stumbling on being hungover.  No one else knows we are dexxed.  We do a passionate group hug and get ready to leave.  

Jade is planning to drop me off (I'm tired and tripping hard at this point).  We stop at a place to get breakfast and Jade stands next to me in line.  She starts rubbing her legs/feet and body against mine really obviously.  I am so disoriented that it was kind of creeping me out.  I didn't respond to it at all, other than just standing there.  I walk to away to pick up my order, and she keeps rubbing against me.  In the corner of my eye, I see her staring at my face for a reaction.  I was expressionless.  

We leave.  Kenny helps me take my boards inside and I go home, saying bye to everyone, except Jade.  

A couple days go by and I ask her to come to band practice with me (she plays an instrument as well).  She responds Ok :).  I call her the next day and she doesnt answer.  I then proceed to text her asking her to hang out with me if she's not to busy.  No response.

I understand.  She's unsure like me.  I'm giving her space, but at the same time I'm worried that she's going to run off with some other douchebag.  She's never had sex with an emotional connection, and neither have I, so we are both virgins in this sense.  We also have so much in common, and I am really starting to like her.  She's a very flirty girl, but she just escalated things quite a bit; I asked her to chill and she ignored me.  I am torn on whether to give her space, or to keep bugging her.  When are we going to see eachother again?

Mark and I started dating 2 years ago. This is his first and my first serious relationship. 

At first everything was great. We got along and had a lot in common. He told me early on that he was depressed and on meds that gave him side effects. He tried a few others on and off, but he always suffered from side effects and eventually sort of stopped taking them. It was really hard and emotionally draining at times, but I tried to be as understanding and patient as I could. I loved him and wanted to make him happy. 

**A little background:** In university, I smoked A LOT of weed. Almost every day I was alone in my room, avoiding people, not doing any school work and getting high. I was incredibly unhappy, lonely, and angry at myself and failed a few classes in that time. I’m pretty sure it did irreparable damage in terms of my ability to focus, my work ethic, and motivation. I felt like a huge loser. But a few months before I met Mark, I decided to change my life around and stop smoking so much. It was extremely hard, but I eventually tapered off until I was only smoking weed with others at parties (a few times a year). I was doing better in school, I made friends, and, most importantly, I was hopeful for my future. I became a very positive, happy person.

**Part 1:** Then I met Mark. Mark and his friends smoked weed frequently. As I started hanging out with them more, I started smoking weed more too. I was terrified of slipping back into my past life (my grades were starting to drop, and I was becoming lazy and complacent again), but since it was still early in the relationship, I didn’t want to unload all this baggage on Mark while he was having fun.

About 5 or 6 months later, though, I broke down and told him I couldn’t stand it anymore. I said I was incredibly uncomfortable with him smoking so much weed and I didn’t want it in my life. I said maybe in the future, if he ever decided to stop, we could pick it up from where we left off, but right now I couldn’t do this. I expected us to break up. I was shocked when he told me that if it was between me and weed, it wasn’t even a choice for him and that he would stop completely if that’s what I needed. 

He said he tried to quit multiple times for years before we met, and that he really wanted to stop. His psychiatrist was telling him he had to quit and he knew it was making his depression worse. He asked me for help and I tried to be as supportive as I could.

He couldn’t stop smoking, though. At first he lied and tried to hide it, but I told him that honesty was really important to me and that he didn't have to hide things. I knew it was hard to quit and if he couldn’t stop completely right away, I would understand as long as he was trying. Months passed and he seemed to be making 0 progress, so I had my doubts. He told me that he would put more effort into it. It seemed to work and we were happy. 

Then, after our first anniversary, we got into a particularly big fight and he told me that he had never really quit and that he would smoke with his friend and his brother, Ethan, behind my back. I was shocked and heartbroken. I trusted him absolutely and felt like an idiot. I always told people that what I loved most about Mark was that he was sincere and selfless but he seemed like a totally different person now. We broke up but he begged me to try again and said that the only reason he lied to me was because he thought that he couldn’t live without me. He promised to really quit and tell the truth this time. It was hard to build the trust up again, but I decided that if I loved him and wanted to be with him, I would have to forgive and move on. Eventually, I trusted him completely again. 

**Part 2:** In the new year, I got a job at his parents’ company. I was so happy to be doing something I was passionate about. However, Mark’s depression got worse and worse. He was distant and I would see him maybe once or twice a week (he wouldn’t let me see him, saying he was tired or that he wanted to be alone). He was short with me often and stopped being affectionate at all. He has some anger issues and he seemed to be losing his temper more and more. Though he never took his anger out on me, it took a toll on the relationship. I missed him so much and felt like I was losing him. Eventually, I confronted him about it and said that it was hard for me to tell if he even loved me anymore. He got angry and said things like, “What’s the big deal if I smoke again? I need it for my depression because I feel suicidal otherwise!” We both got extremely frustrated and broke up. When I talked to my parents, they told me I was being unfair and selfish and that his depression was not his fault. I felt terrible. I called and apologized and asked him to give me another chance. All I wanted to do now was be supportive. It was painful to watch him so depressed and I wanted him to be happy. 

A few weeks after our second anniversary, a girl from his past contacted him. Mark used to have a crush on her before we met. She said no to him at first, then yes, then no again. She was depressed, suicidal, and self harmed. About a year and a half into Mark and my relationship, she called him and said that she was in love with him, that she couldn’t live without him, and that she was suicidal. He told her he was with me and couldn’t talk to her anymore. 

This time, she contacted him and said that she was feeling really depressed and needed to talk to “someone who understands”. I was uncomfortable but let him make his own decisions. They talked on the phone. He said that though he had no desire to date her or anything, he wanted to help her. I was incredibly uncomfortable with the idea and wondered why he cut her off last time but not now. She didn’t say she was over him. I felt like it was because he didn’t respect our relationship as much as he used to. He told me before that because this was his first relationship he sometimes wondered whether he was missing out. I was worried. He told me he would update me on everything that happened with her. The next day, I lost it and checked his Facebook account. I saw msgs from her that day, including, “Let me know when you’re back in town!” I tried to play it cool and asked him if she msged him and whether he planned to see her. He said no to both. When I checked his account again, he had deleted the msgs. 

I left work to see him and after some pushing, he confessed to everything. He admitted deleting the messages but insisted he had no plans to cheat on me or anything. He told me his depression made him confused as to whether or not he still loved me. He had been smoking weed again behind my back. He also did MDMA with Ethan behind my back (I made it very clear around the same time as the weed stuff that I was very against this). I was furious and broke up with him then. I have never seen him so upset and he begged me to take him back saying he couldn’t live without me.

I told him that if he could turn his life around, find a way to treat and manage his depression, get help for quitting weed, cut of all contact with that other girl, and NEVER lie to me again, we could try dating again. He told me we wouldn’t go back to seeing each other just once or twice a week, that he would appreciate me, and that he wanted to build a life with me. He said if I was by his side, he could do all the things he needed to improve his life. He seemed sincere and I took him back again. He started a new medication he was afraid to take before (a HUGE deal) and it seemed to help a bit. Though I’m still rebuilding trust, and am trying to get over what he did, I was very hopeful. 

**Part 3:** (Thanks for sticking with me this far!) He has been smoking weed almost every day since we got back together. There were maybe three days in the last month that he didn’t smoke weed. I also have NOT been seeing him more frequently like he promised, instead he stays home and smokes alone. I started to feel like he was taking advantage of me again and that he wasn’t really trying at all. I frequently got angry and told him this and he would get really angry and say that I don’t understand how depression and addiction works and that I wasn’t being supportive enough. 

Last week, after dinner with his parents, he dropped me off and we were hanging out when Ethan asked if he wanted to hang out. We both knew he meant smoke weed. He said he was going to go. He didn’t even tell Ethan or his friends that he was quitting and was smoking with them freely when he wasn’t smoking by himself. I was very angry.

This week, we went to see his psychiatrist together. He said that I wasn’t reinforcing Mark’s successes as much as I should, but also that Mark needed to start putting 100% into quitting (Mark insists he IS trying hard). Afterwards, I thought of all the things he did in the last 2 years and let that anger build up. I called him and yelled at him about how he hasn’t been trying at all and how disappointed and hurt I was. He was very hurt and has said before that he is sick of feeling guilty and shitty about himself and that I make these feelings a lot worse. I regret yelling at him. I know I hurt him a lot I feel like it’s one of the worst things I’ve ever done. He called the next day and told me that he didn’t know if he could be with someone who doesn’t understand how hard it is to deal with depression and addiction. We’re going to meet on Sunday to talk about everything. 

Reddit, am I an idiot? Do I not understand how depression works and am just being selfish? I love him so, so much, but I don’t know how much more I can take of this. What do I do?

11616,Relationships,1k413p,"Background: we started dating senior year of high school then did 2 hour long distance during the school year for the past three years, spent holidays and summer in the same town. He's about to transfer to university from community college and will be in a different state in the fall. 

He's always lightly joked about never wanting kids (when we see a cute kid on the street he'd sometimes jokingly say that's disgusting, etc.). Lately I've been thinking a lot about my future, I'm about to graduate in the summer and will either go to grad school or get a job. He has the next two years planned out because he'll be at university.

Essentially neither of us has our future planned out, but I like to imagine we'll end up together. We love each other a lot and I can see myself being with him in the long run. That might have been why his comments about not wanting kids were making me uneasy lately, because I have always expected that I'll eventually have kids. We had had a few discussions about it before which kinda ended in what's the point of talking about it, we're getting ahead of ourselves. But today I mentioned an article I read that was on the front page of Time magazine this month about how childless couples have it all. We then talked about him not wanting kids and me wanting kids. He said he respected that I wanted to have kids and it didn't seem to bother him. But he kept talking about it with me because he understood that it bothered me. I asked how he was fine with staying with me even when we have pretty different stances on the matter and he said he would rather focus on having a decent relationship than worry about whether he'll eventually have kids. He said he still feels like a dumb kid, referencing only just being accepted into college. But he also said people change, I guess implying that maybe in the future if he feels stable and everything is perfect he might consider having kids.


We ended the conversation with me explaining how if we are together in a long time and I decide I do want kids but I know how he currently feels about it, I would just be waiting on him to change. He agreed that that would be unfair. His last remark, after I asked him about it, was that he is 75%l sure he will never want kids. I am 75% I will want kids. Are we supposed to break up? Keep talking about it? Avoid talking about it? I'm afraid if we stay together (which is what I want) that this will become an issue for us and make us resent each other or make us super sensitive about anything kid related.

We've been dating for six months and I thought things were going pretty well, but last night we got into an argument that may end it all. She's not the most emotionally stable person (fighting depression, had a rough childhood being raised by a single mom who didn't have time for her) but goes to therapy, and she's had a few rough relationships. Right now she student teaches and works part time, I work and go to school full time.

We have plenty of sex, and it's great. But last night she wanted to have sex a few hours after we had both gotten each other off, and I hadn't recharged so to speak. A few hours later she got a little mopey about it since my sister (24, lives with me) came home and we don't want things to get awkward. After  practically avoiding me for a half hour, I told her it's not a big deal, which caused her to flip her shit and leave. I was referring to the lack of sex from that day, she thought I was referring to her past.

We got into a phone argument for about an hour after that and she confessed that she's wanted to break up with me from time to time, even though we say we love each other every time we see each other. In the past we've had arguments about time spent together (at the time we worked weird hours but have since been seeing each other at last twice a week and sometimes up to four, we live 30 minutes away so it can be tough sometimes), and also another time when I snatched my phone away from her because she thought I was hiding something. Both times she got really emotional and I'm worried of what's going to happen to us if this keeps going.

I am in an amazing relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years. We planned to get engaged soon and both had no doubts about wanting to spend the rest of our lives together. I've never cheated before. I feel sick and I don't understand what was going through my head, except that I was horny, and this guy was hot and smart and giving me attention. I have never felt any desire to leave or cheat on my boyfriend. I love him more than I can even express.

I just don't even know what to do now. As soon as I woke up the next day I wanted to tell him and grovel for beg for forgiveness because the guilt is eating me alive. But on the other hand, it would give me some sort of cathartic relief, whereas it would just hurt him and our relationship. I don't think he would leave me, and while we had discussed the possibility of a semi-open relationship in the past, this was definitely wrong. It would destroy him though. He is amazing; he didn't deserve this and he doesn't deserve me.

What makes it worse is we will be long-distance for about 6 months starting this summer due to a graduate program, so we don't have a ton of time left together.

If I don't tell him, I don't think he will find out. A long while ago we had briefly discussed cheating, and I said that if he messed up and cheated (in a one-night-stand situation, not it an another-relationship situation), I wouldn't want to know. I honestly can't remember is he agreed though.

It was a big change and I quickly latched on to people to make connections since everyone was a complete stranger. I talked to a few people who were involved on the class of 2018 Facebook group. I talked to one girl the entire summer and we grew close, helping each other through our breakups that had both recently happened. We ended up falling for each other and started dating the second week of school. 


When we started dating, she was concerned that I would grow to regret being held down by a girlfriend, especially since my college has a huge drinking/hook-up culture and a big bar scene. We've been dating for five months now and I'm starting to feel left out when I watch all of my friends go out to the bars and talk to other girls while I'm generally alone since I don't want to hit on girls, which would greatly upset my girlfriend (or any girlfriend).



My girlfriend is amazing. Even though I'm young, I could see us spending a very long time together. She's the best girlfriend I've ever had and truly cares about me. Today, however, we got on the topic of what we wanted out of the relationship. I tried to put the topic off but she pried out of me that I'm just not ready for something as serious as that right now (because of my breakup in the beginning of summer). She reluctantly agreed to take a break and to try it over when we're both ready for that level of seriousness. 

I'm so torn between wanting the full college experience and between not wanting my girlfriend to be destroyed on the inside or find someone else. It may be selfish but I'm 18 and simply can't afford to invest all of my emotions in someone right now. But at the same time, imagining her with someone else is painful. I'm afraid she won't be around when I think it's time we try it again.

I should explain our relationship. My mother and I have never been close. I resent her in many ways. My dad committed suicide when I was 4, making my mom into a workaholic and my oldest brother into the parent. I know its not her fault, but I have always felt I missed a big part of my childhood because she was never around. Even when she was around, I felt that I cold never tell her anything. My mom has always been a **huge** gossip. She doesn't know when she is over sharing with other people.

Since middle school, things between me and my mom have constantly been tense. Unlike my siblings, I can't hold my tongue when my mom says something rude, causing a lot of fighting. The fighting was amplified when I realized I don't believe in her religion and told her so.

About 2 years ago I had a falling out with some of my friends near the end of the school year, causing me to fall into a depression that summer. I was alone a lot (my mom took away my phone and I couldn't contact anyone outside of my family), making my depression worse. I became suicidal for a while, but my feeling calmed down as time passed.

Since then, I have had many ups and downs. I finally came to my mom saying I wanted therapy in August of 2014. She was reluctant, but found someone (who happened to have the same faith as my mother). (I have since stopped seeing this therapist, went to another and found a psychiatrist, started medicine and stopped therapy altogether.)

I was never really comfortable with that therapist because she was the same religion as my mother and I felt I wouldn't be completely honest with her. The one positive thing that came out of my weekly therapy that went on for months was the technique of writing in my journal that she taught me.

Basically, when you fell like you're in a dark place or you can't sort out your feelings, you writer down every thought and feeling that comes to your mind. No punctuation or spelling, just emotions. I only wrote in the journal a handful of times, but my entries were always pretty dark. I kept the journal in my bedroom, hidden either on my desk or in a drawer. I even wrote in the middle of the book so if someone found it, they would think it was blank. I never thought my mom would go through my room and find it.

My sister and I were going through the safe my mom keeps in her room, trying to find the registration to my sister's car so she could sell it. There were a bunch of papers me and my sister were sorting through. My sister told me she found an old story I had written and started to read it out loud when I realized it was from my journal. I took the small stack of papers out of my sister's hand and found they were all copies of the pages in my journal. 

I explained what the papers were to my sister and slightly shocked. My mother had read her journal before so my sister wasn't very surprised. 

I tried to take the copies of my journal so I could shred them, but my sister wouldn't let me, not wanting my mom to get mad at her. 

I don't know if my mother has told anyone about my journal, but knowing her she probably has told her triplet sisters and my step dad. 

I don't know what to do. I feel so invaded and hurt. My mom destroyed the little trust we had. I don't know how or when she found the journal. I haven't had the opportunity to talk with her about it, and even when I do, I don't know how to bring it up or stay calm while I am talking. Any advice would be wonderful. 
   
**tl;dr: My mom found the journal my old therapist told me to write in. She then made copies of the pages and kept them in the safe. My sister wouldn't allow me to throw away the copies. I feel hurt and don't know what to do.**

11635,Relationships,2y7tvi,"**TL;DR:** Boyfriend cyber cheated on me and says he didn't follow through with anything. Not sure where to go from here.

Let me start off by saying that I am not in the right in a few of these things that I've done and I know that- but let's get beyond the fact that I intruded on his privacy first. 

Backstory: My boyfriend, we'll call him James, and I started out as just having sex for the first year and went on and off in a relationship for maybe 6 months after that, until we finally made the decision to be together exclusively 3 years ago. We moved in together, 6 hours away from family, 1 year ago. He was a player, and I am so not. 


In our first year, I went away to New Orleans without him for a week. I came back, and he broke down and told me that he had talked to other girls and flirted and received dirty pictures and texts. I forgave him and it took a really, really long time for me to recover and trust him again.

Through that, there were a few inappropriate comments on instagram like dem lips and damn those legs sorry not sorry (yeah, I'm a girl and I remember EVERYTHING.)

I told him it was unacceptable and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. He hasn't done that since.

Now, come up to our third year, and I go away to our home city for a friend's birthday party- all is good. No big deal. When I come back, we're sleeping and I wake up in the middle of the night and his phone is not plugged in. I look through it. (I KNOW this is terrible of me, please don't make me feel worse about it)

I don't find anything at first. Nothing weird in texts, pictures, facebook, whatever, then I find this Google Phone app, and there's nothing in the normal folder but a TON of stuff in his deleted history. Messages to and from girls (all sent during the weekend I was gone), some small talk conversations and some need a rub down tonight. Are you available? He's changed his name to these women, and I also see that he's met a few girls at Target through the messages.
I freak out. Obviously. I wake him up and say Who's Jasper? He pretends not to know what I'm talking about, goes downstairs and grabs some water. Comes back up and explains everything.

He said that he didn't meet anybody, and that he was never planning on meeting any of the rub down / sensual massages women. (I'll give him that because most of them fell through and the one that was available, he stopped talking to as soon as she asked our address.) He said that he was contacting them through a type of craigslist, and that he's just got a fetish for happy ending massage parlors. I have no problem with fetishes and acting them out if he wants, I really don't, but he didn't tell me about this. 
Then he said he talked to the girls at Target because he felt unsexy and unwanted and wanted to see if he could get a girl's number/ talk to a girl, that it was more of a game. Just to see if he could do it.

We made a pact that I can see his phone and appliances at any time, without questions. But I also think he's too smart for me to find anything again.

He's got some self confidence issues, and so do I- but I'm just not sure anymore if it's normal anymore. He started going to see a therapist and psychiatrist this week (2 weeks after event).

The first time, and the comments on instagram are one thing, but for him to do it a second time? I'm just... heartbroken, and so upset. 
We have a life together and have plans for our future, and after this happened, he literally proposed to me because he was afraid of losing me. (I said no because we're too young, and obviously this isn't what you want a marriage to start with)

What do I do? Do I stay with him and take his word for it? Or do I break up with him over what I think is happening? 

It's been about 2 weeks, and things have been okay at home... I've gone through his phone once, and he deleted his google phone app, and everything involved with that. 
I'm just not sure I want to break up with him, because I do believe him- to an extent. I think I just need some advice. Men? Is it common, do you talk to girls on the internet just because? Am I being unreasonable? Am I crazy for being so upset?!

11636,Relationships,3av8zs,"Long time lurker here. I've seen a lot of great advice given on redditt and I finally hit an issue that I could really use some advice with.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months and its been the best relationship I've ever had. For the first time I feel like I've found someone that was definitely made for me. With that being said last week was a bad week. She was very distant, not very happy and just blah as she calls it. Yes, she was having her period but she's never been like this. She wouldn't really explain why she felt so shitty and then after a few days just said she was stressed about money and us moving (we plan on relocating next year). It was basically just an off week for her and I can understand that. 

But me being a guy, I felt like maybe there was something more. So when she went to bed I went through her phone. I realize this is crossing a line but I just couldn't help myself. I didn't find anything bad at all in her texts, pics. Nothing. I went to her email and went to sent just to see and also found nothing except one thing.

It was two picture of a guy she had been seeing/hooking up with for a few months before I came into the picture. I am not threatened by this guy at all and never have been. He had months to lock her down and he couldn't - she told me she kind of just liked his company for the time being and was waiting for something better to come along - who happened to be me. The two pictures are of him holding his new born niece. Nothing sexual or anything. I thought she had been chatting with him and he sent them to her through text but I confirmed a mutual friend of theirs sent them to her in a text. 

I feel like this is very petty but I couldn't help myself and ask her about it. She was obviously mad I went through her stuff but besides that all she could really say is that she sometimes saves pictures like that so that maybe years from now she could see them again and look back at her life and look at a path that she didn't take. She also said she didn't even remember saving them even though it was 3 weeks ago. 

So I just don't really know what to think or if I should worry at all. Like I said we are great. We have an amazingly healthy relationship and nothing like this has ever gone wrong. I can't even think of a time we have been actually upset with each other. I guess in a way I just feel hurt and feel like there could be another motive but she has been nothing but trustworthy and is a great girlfriend. 

Do I just chalk this up as something stupid and be done with it?

11637,Relationships,39jr13,"I’m a wordy person so apologies in advance. We’ve been together 5 years, married for one. Three years into the relationship, the “incident” happened. My husband, Brett, is a very outgoing and friendly person. He’s the kind of guy who can walk into a store for bread and walk out with several new friends and phone numbers (guys or girls). At the time, we were living separately. I was adamant that I didn’t want to move in together until we were engaged based on how my family would react.


He and his friend group sort of “adopted” a girl [19] who we’ll call Brandi. She and her on-again-off-again boyfriend would all hang out together. We did a few double dates together but nothing really came out of it. Over time, she and Brett started to get closer. He claimed he saw her as a “little sister” figure (he was 28 at the time) and that she was quickly becoming one of his “best friends”. This bothered me. I couldn’t quite understand how a girl almost 10 years younger than him and in a very different stage of life could be a “best friend”.  We started to get in little fights about it. I told him that I didn't mind them being friends but I was starting to get uncomfortable with how strong the relationship was. I wanted to be his best friend and I didn't understand why he needed another girl to have that position. 


One example – we all went out to a movie together.  It wasn’t something I especially wanted to see, but he and his friends (Brandi, her boyfriend, and Brett's roommate, Ted) were going and he asked me to come. Afterwards it was late and I wanted to go to bed, but Brandi started talking about going to watch reruns of a show my husband doesn’t even like. I asked him to come back to my place with me (where he usually slept anyway) but he wanted to go hang out with them instead (or as I saw it, with her).


Then her life started to fall apart. She and her bf broke up and her parents kicked her out of the house because she’d decided to drop out of school. Brett and Ted decided to let her crash at their place for a bit. I was not happy and asked that it not be permanent - maybe a 2 week thing while she found something else. They had a 2 bedroom apartment and she was sleeping on the couch in the living room. 



Brett really likes his privacy. He’s always really liked having space that’s just his. When we were living apart, his room was off limits to me (mostly because I’ve always been critical of how messy he is and he didn't want to hear it or see me judging when I was in the room). So he basically never let me in there. That being said, he did spend the majority of his time at my place - he didn't have much furniture anyway, and our shared pets lived with me, so it made more sense to be there. Brett had the master bedroom of the apartment with a master bath, and he decided that Brandi could use his bathroom because Ted’s bathroom (the communal one to the rest of the house) was “disgusting”. This meant that Brandi could walk through his room whenever she wanted. Note: the rest of the guests (including me) used Ted's whenever we were over.


I also became convinced that Brandi was flirting with Brett.  Brett would mention offhandedly about how he accidentally walked in on her naked because she slept naked or was changing in the living room, etc. but played it off as in oops! while I was sure she was doing it on purpose. 


We started to fight about Brandi a lot, and about why she was still living there over a month later. Ted even came to my apartment one day while Brett was out to talk. He wanted to warn me that he was worried about Brandi and Brett’s relationship and that I might lose Brett to her. This is completely out of character for Ted. When I brought it up to Brett, he brushed it off and assured me he has no feelings other than wanting to look out for her and Ted is socially awkward and didn’t have a girlfriend so he didn’t understand the difference.


Eventually Brett told me he wanted to let her move in permanently. His argument: he was always over at my place anyway so she could stay in his room when he wasn’t there. We already knew that Ted had decided that he was moving back home in a few months when the lease was up. Brett had been looking for another roommate unsuccessfully for a few weeks and here was Brandi looking for a place to live. He argued that I had left him no options since I was so strongly against him moving in with me.


The final bombshell came a few weeks later. He came over one morning and I could tell something was wrong but he wouldn’t tell me. Brett had been working late at night on a project so we hadn’t been sleeping together. I’d been missing him and had begged him to let me come over and just sleep in his room while he worked. He refused because the project he was working on required clearance and did not allow him to have anyone else in the room. When I finally broke him down, he admitted that Brandi had been having problems sleeping and he had let her fall asleep on his bed in his room while he was working. I felt completely betrayed. I flipped out. There was a lot of screaming and crying and I basically told him that if she moved in, we were done. He told me he needed some time to think because he couldn’t believe I would give him an ultimatum. 


After some time apart, I came back with a renewed mindset. I decided he was right about one thing - the ideal solution was for him to move in with me. My desire not to was based on what my family would think, not what I wanted or what was best for our relationship. I asked him to move in with me instead. He shocked me by saying he didn’t want to. 


Then the “truth” came out. He'd been keeping from me that Brandi had a lot more problems than I thought. She was a drug addict that had been clean since she met Brett and his group of friends. He was afraid that if he kicked her out, she would go back to her ex (who had been supplying her) and would fall back into that life again. It hit close to home for him because of similar issues in his family and from childhood. I told him that I understood why he felt the way he did and I wished he could have just been honest with me from the start – but that since he chose to keep her secret for her even at the expense of harming our relationship and making me feel as horrible as I'd been feeling, he lost any chance of me being okay with their relationship. It was still me or her.


He chose me. When he told her she had to leave, she lost it. They had a really nasty fight and he realized that she really was a bitch. We both found out later from a mutual friend that she told him she had been stripping on purpose around the house to try to tempt Brett (just like I said) and she didn’t think I treated Brett well and he deserved better (her). 


They stopped talking. A few weeks later, hindsight being 20/20, Brett broke down in front of me and said that he had been completely blinded by trying to save her. He was so completely sorry for putting me through everything with her and he should have put the breaks on the relationship when I first told him I was getting uncomfortable. 


Fast forward 3 years - Brandi has remained out of our lives. She has since tried to contact him on several occasions and he tells her to fuck off. We’ve since gotten married and are for the most part quite happy… but the problem is that I get jealous very easily of new girls in his life. I understand that he doesn’t see a difference between guy friends and girl friends and that his nature in general is often seen as flirty by girls, even though he would talk to a guy the same say. But I have a genuine problem with him meeting and befriending new females. If we have mutual female friends, I am completely fine if we all hang out together, but get really upset if he hangs out with her alone. I don’t find it appropriate considering the massive mess that happened the last time. When I get upset, he just tells me that I’m too jealous. He promises me he loves me and only wants me – and I believe him. That’s not the problem. 


This has come to light because we recently met a new female friend (who is also in a relationship) who I thought was going to be great for a double date or girl’s night out… but who he has now been texting and getting lunch with while I’m at work. Suddenly all the feelings from Brandi that I thought I was over and done with have come erupting up again and I don’t know what to do. Is he being unreasonable given the history? Am I overly jealous? 


TLDR: Husband once nearly threw away our 3 year relationship over a girl that he became friends with during our relationship… We moved past it after a lot of heartache and now he says I’m unreasonably jealous when he wants to hang out with a new female friend without me around.

I have been with Turk for 11 months. He is my brother's former roommate. 

When I moved back from college, my brother (26m) offered to put me on his gym plan. I agreed. I was 'skinny fat' and way out of shape. I ate like shit at college and the last year was so intense I barely had time to eat, let alone work out. 

Turk was also on the plan. So we all went together. We started dating and the gym became our thing. My brother has since moved out of town, so I have my own plan. 

So six months ago, one of the managers approached and asked if I would be interested in a job at the gym. I agreed, did the classes they required, and started working there. During this time Turk was super supportive. 

However, Turk applied for a position and was turned down. We got into a fight and he said I should quit because it would ruin our quality time. I told him a job is a job and I was already friends with two of the trainers (likely why I was hired in the first place). 

I love my job and kind of want to become a certified yoga instructor. 

This is the issue: 

Turk has been resentful about the job, which pays well and has lax hours. He works a job he hates. He stopped going to the gym and joined another one. But he insists on picking me up from work three times a week.

But he will get mad when he sees I am still in my gym gear. I don't bring extra clothes when I work late because I am so tired I just want to go home and sleep. 

I have a uniform (black shorts and a tank top/shirt). They give us several and allow for any length pants. But with how much I am running around, I wear shorts and a tank top. Men wear the same uniform and often the same style shorts (spandex). 

Turk says I need to wear more covering at work. 

My boyfriend is treating me like shorts equals flirting/trying to cheat. I am just doing my job. He also got upset I have a regular male client. This is how I make money!

I like my boyfriend. I want to stay with him. But this is starting to get annoying as fuck. He also hates when I wear shorts and tank tops because I am *showing off* to people. Well, no shit, I work out every day, I want to wear clothes that don't look like a burka.

why? he and sisters' fiance used to be best friends/close as real siblings (saying that about each other) until about half a year ago. something happened and my BF was the one to cut ties and they say about each other he's changed so much in the last months, I don't know who he is anymore and don't want him in my life. it's kinda ironic once you think about, both see themselves as the better guy. 


so now my sister is getting married, my mom and I are pretty excited - and BF ain't gonna be at the wedding at all.. Sorry, but I'm not going, you know the reason :) that's how he confirmed my suspicion today. and no, I don't know the reason except that he doesn't wants to go. 


I'm sad and kinda pissed and need some perspective because I'm not sure if I'm being a bitch right now. 


I understand he just doesn't want to see the fiance anymore but I feel he's basically saying I'd rather miss out on a huge family event with the family I say I want to be a part of because I don't like this guy. and this is a problem because what's gonna Happen in the future, will he just stay away every time my sisters fiance is present? and this is a wedding!

**tl;dr**: sister set to marry ex-best friend of my boyfriend. boyfriend refuses to attend the wedding making me feel he's betraying me and my family for a purely selfish reason. 

**Edit²:
I asked my sister and the groom and they both expressed that they do not want BF at their wedding considering his behaviour towards fiancé and that he brought it onto himself by acting the way he does. they were very clear about their resentment towards him (and they don't think I should be with him). I will talk to him about the big picture (future situations). I feel that this entire dynamic is completely broken and I am ending up in the middle of three people I hold dear that dislike the pure thought of one another.** 

**Edit:**
I'm totally blown away by the many responses! I didn't respond to all of them but every input is greatly appreciated!
I'm adding a bit of information at this point, it's mostly what I wrote in some comments.

1. since there was a lot of speculating about whatever issue got them to drift apart as I put it: I am a 100 % sure it has nothing to do with cheating ;) these are two latino men that rely more on their emotions than rational or logical thoughts when it comes to friendships. they feel the other one has changed to being a bad person (BF says fiancé is selfish because he uses people for his benefit and he (BF) feels exploited by him // fiancé says BF is selfish because he has become superficial and doesn't care about other people) so they - being good people - distance themselves from the other one. to top it my BF wouldn't talk to him about what made him cut contact and fiancé is hurt and insulted by BFs behaviour. it's stupid and childish really and I've tried to get them to at least talk things out but to no avail.


2. you are all right about this not being about me but rather about what the bride, groom and my BF want since this is supposed to be a beautiful day for my sister and her future husband. the comment that I probably wouldn't like to attend a wedding of a person I dislike, is a good one and on a purely rational level, I can understand my BF. on the other hand, I am not sure if he would be so understanding if I refused to go to his cousins wedding because of a reason like that. AND: This is my family and it is one of the few moments, where extended family from my home country will be around.. I would appreciate it if my BF where there to show I'm part of cresp1s' life and family and get to know them.. after all, his extended family lives far away as well, so he knows how much value lies in these get-togethers.. 


3. so: I will send him a voice message rather than text later today when he is awake and ask to talk.. I would rather have this discussion via skype than whatsapp because I'm sure he won't like it. hopefully we'll get a near date for that because talking is always a bit difficult due to jobs and all. 


4. I will also ask the bride and groom what they think, if they would even want to have him there. I can honestly imagine that - since the guys are not talking - there would be less tension if he didn't go. I guess it would be kind of awkward to talk, dance, have fun with them while BF stays on the other side of the room. I don't feel like he would actually want to be nice since he thinks his behaviour towards fiancé is totally justified. 

5. I am also aware of the possible conflict regarding future get-togethers and it is one of my main concerns in this entire situation. one wedding okay, but what about events in the next X years, birthdays (will he not come to MY birthday if future brother-in-law is going to attend?), parties, holidays, he would get to be an uncle at some point and just refuse to bond with these children? what about casual get-togethers like BBQs or family dinners? writing this makes me see that this is way bigger than just a wedding and I can just imagine him saying we'll see when those situations happen. yeah. awesome. 


6. what a few people said about him being a man-child when it comes to conflict and all that, yes. it's frustrating and has led to tension because I have no problem discussing conflicts - of course it's not great to hear about my flaws or something I did that he didn't like but that's part of being in a relationship. he has a huge ego and gets offended very easily. I have talked to him about it (meaning I talked about the necessity of a healthy communication between us and he fended it off by saying that they are pointless or repeated discussions that are no necessity). this is going to be a deal breaker if it doesn't change.. and I know this is due to his family background which makes it even harder because his mother never raised him in this honest and repectful discussion of opinions-way and they treat his little sister the same way.

About 3 years ago we had finally started keeping our heads above water and we decided to move to a larger facility. Since that time; I have been paying all of the household bills, mortgage, electricity, food, fun budget etc.

Well now he's made the decision to close his business and get a fulltime job - the stress was getting to him. He is going to be making about 2x as much as me (I have a decent job 50k a year); but he wants to keep 'his' money. I am having a small issue with that because I really haven't had any 'me' money because it's been going all towards bills for the last 6 years!!! 

I don't want him to think that I'm just looking for his money - which clearly I'm not; but i don't want to get stuck with all the bills still while he has boatloads of money to spend frivolously on what he wants!! I'm not sure how to go about talking to him about it; without coming off as a money-grubbing wife.

11643,Relationships,383cgm,"We've been married for 5 years, and we have 1 child. I'm not sure if what she does is actually verbal abuse. She has a low frustration tolerance, and if I do something wrong, e.g. forget to throw a soda can away, put an item in an incorrect place, etc., she becomes frustrated and angry and speaks to me in a hateful, condescending way with angry facial expressions, like I'm an idiot. However, she never insults me by calling me stupid, worthless, lazy, etc. Her body language, anger, and tone make me feel that way sometimes though. 

She never overtly insults me, but on rare occasions she says things to make me feel guilty to intentionally hurt me. I'm not sure if this is considered verbal abuse or not. Some things/people say yes, some say no. Either way, it is disrespectful. Friends and family have noticed and commented on her tone and disrespect towards me. 

I'm not a pushover, so her manner of speaking to me and attitude that occur almost daily has caused friction. Just after year 1, is when it started happening, and I kindly pointed it out to her. She realized it is a problem and has tried to fix it, or so she says. 

When I point it out (when she speaks to me this way), like she's asked me to (in order to fix it), she becomes argumentative and defensive, saying that she isn't speaking to me harshly and that I'm just getting upset over small things. 

After these years if comtinuous disrespect and little effort to improve, I no longer love her (there are other reasons too, but this is the main one). I've told her this, she apologized, then went right back to degrading me. At least she rarely does it in front of people now.

She learned this manner of communication from her mother, and I am afraid that it's so deeply ingrained in her personality now that she doesn't have the capacity to change. We are going to counseling soon because we do not want a divorce. I've made it very clear to her though that I refuse to live in a miserable, loveless marriage until I die, especially when she makes no effort to speak to me like a normal human being.

He drinks beer everyday, he doesn't want a job, he has no insurance of any kind, he doesn't exercise, he doesn't want to go to school, he does not trust me or anyone for anything whatsoever, he is very negative about nearly everything in life and doesn't like making friends. He doesn't like any of (or whatever is left) of my friends and hates it when I try to have a life outside of him.

I just got back from the Kaiser clinic and he was furious with me because I logged out from my computer account so he wouldn't intrude into my things since I have zero privacy in my life. (first time doing that)  But I'm just afraid to talk to him cause he is very upset and wants nothing to do with me right now.

In addition to his anger, he is also mad at me because he thought I went to a friend's house (I was at the clinic). A friend messaged me yesterday with Want to hang out tomorrow at 5? but I did not respond. Coincidentally I left at 5 for the clinic, he remotely logged into my Facebook via his laptop (since mine was locked) and checked my messages while I was gone. He now strongly believes that I was at my friend's house since he saw the unread message my friend left me. That's all he needs for evidence. lol


I'm tired of being sad and scared all the time. I'm tired of not being trusted because I don't have solid 100% undeniable proof every second of the day at his command. I mean I have a pamphlet I picked up from Kaiser for goodness sake! : (

So I've been kind of seeing a new girl, and her and a few friends we both share invited me out to the bar.  She was pretty wasted and I was sober.  

She spends the majority of the night hanging on this other guy, whom she kind of knew from sometime in the past.  When I say hang, I mean literally put her arm around this guy's arm.  I know this is a romantic gesture, as she has done the same to me in the past.  I wasn't so much jealous of the other guy, as I was offended that she just ignored me the entire evening.  The guy even apologized to me because he knew what was going on.


Here's my situation though.  Is this something I should forgive?  I think I've lost perspective on what is considered a forgivable offense, due to my past relationship history.


My first instinct is to forgive, because, compared to my past girlfriend who would have sex with people in my bed, this seems like nothing.  If I managed to forgive that, then why should I care about 2 hours in a bar where she ignored me?


But then I think: This is exactly how I got into such a messed up relationship in the past.  To avoid the same thing, I shouldn't be forgiving.  I shouldn't repeat my behavior.  I should expect the same respect out of people that I give them.  This relationship hasn't been going on very long, and I can cut out now and possibly avoid further problems.

She is trying to enter a program in another state but applied late and so she is submitting an appeal to be able to apply, but she was acting distant. We are pretty open about things and so I asked what was wrong and she said that she was just stressed about the transfer process and was just worried about the uncertainty that she might not even get in. We end up talking all afternoon and things seemed okay. 

I went with some friends and she went with some friends, which is fine, no problem in that, we do that all the time. Two hours later she texts me asking if I want to come over, which obviously I said yes to because I really enjoy her company. I get over there and we are just hanging out and she is still stressed and being distant. We get into bed and I try to cuddle with her but it seemed like she didn't even want to touch me. I ask her what is wrong and she says that its all the stress she was talking about earlier. At one point I say I'm leaving because I just couldn't handle how distant she was being.

I offered if she wanted to work out the next day and she says maybe because she is making dinner with a friend she hasn't seen in a while. That is the last time I have talked to her, it has been three days, we have never gone this long without talking. She also posted on FB that her appeal was approved, so the thing that was stressing her out should have been solved.

I keep receiving mixed advice, with some people telling me that I don't deserve that treatment and I should ignore her and wait until she talks to me and pretend like I didn't notice her absence and others telling me to talk to her. I feel like both are right, my pride is telling me I don't deserve this shit when I've done nothing wrong and shouldn't be with someone that starts ignoring me after 3 months but another part of me want to just hold her and see her again and have things like they used to be. I really like this girl and I don't want it to end but it feels like it might end soon.

I live in Philadelphia, but I spent the summer in LA on a school program. While I was there, I befriended a girl who also lives in Philly and was very attracted to her. The last week we were on the program, we ended up hooking up.

That week, we spent a lot of time together getting to know each other and I guess we both started having feelings for one another. She explained, though, that her and her ex had an agreement that they would try again when she returned at the end of summer. I realized how similar we are in a lot of ways and found myself dreading having to cut off the relationship.

So we ended things on a melancholy note. I returned home with my tail between my legs, thinking that was the end of it. But we kept talking.

Then we. started hanging out as friends. Nothing happening. But we were drowning in sexual tension. Eventually, both of us expressed that we were still very interested in one another, but she was conflicted on the promise she had made to her ex.

Now, let me explain their relationship very quickly (from her perspective). Dated for 2 years. Broke up a year ago. She's sadgirl and goes through a rough patch. Comes out feeling way better about it and herself. End of the schoolyear, he asks her to try again. She agrees, saying she will after the summer.

Guess now we're both confused. Her ex is very jealous. He's stated, if she starts anything with me, that's the end of their friendship. She doesn't want to sacrifice this 3 yr friendship with someone she's been very close to because of someone else she met just a few short months ago. However, she doesn't think she should be in a relationship if she's having feelings for someone else.

She just graduated college and living in a new part of the city and being in between jobs is really stressing her out. My feelings are that a lot of the reason she's going back to her ex is because he's something familiar. A security blanket. 

She's been honest and open to me and him about the whole thing and he's obviously not happy with this. He basically told her to stop talking to me, but she continues to slip me hellos every so often. And does things like tell me she's enjoying the book I lent her or misses the sweatshirt of mine I let her wear all summer. She clearly doesn't know what she wants.

So I'm wondering what to do. I'm really hurting because I really like this girl, but do I shut her out until she makes her decision? I don't want her to think I am over her.

Do I make an ultimatum with her? Do I keep being a friend and not making any moves?

I had tried to take our friendship to the relationship level many times but she always told me he was not ready. Finally after writing her off we started dating.


We had an awesome relationship. I was living with my roommates but she would spend a few days a week at my place. We took trips together on our breaks and then went backpacking when we finished university. We stepped into great jobs when graduating, as a couple bringing in approximately 150k per year and continuing to do things we both enjoyed. My job was location independent but hers was not. We moved in together for a while and that wasn't bad.


However, about two months ago I started wondering if there was something else I should be doing with my youth. Given the location independence I wanted to continue backpaking for a while (FWIW I've traveled a lot so this may be selfish). I also wanted to move to a town closer to home. Finally, the biggest problem was I was worried I'd never have the opportunity to have my own apartment, own my own things, and build my own life before merging my life with someone else.

So, before my father met my mother, he was married to another woman and had three children. 2 girls and a boy. My dads ex-wife cheated on him with his best friend, and sufficed it to say they divorced. My dad met my mom, had me (I'm an only child), and 4 years later my dad's Son (my half-brother) died in a car crash at 18 years old. My dad spiraled into a huge depression, and has not talked with his other children since I was about 4. I don't agree with it, and I'm sad that it happened and that he no longer talks with his other children, but what's done is done. He is the best father I could possibly hope for, and I love him dearly. My dad is actively in my life, and maybe even sometimes over compensates possibly due to regret. This is not a discussion about my father, so please refrain from making comments about how he shouldn't have left his other children. 

With that background out of the way, about 3.5 years ago, the eldest of my half sisters (Tara) contacted me via facebook. I only met her once before when I was 4 years old at my half brother's funeral. She contacted me saying that it was a very difficult thing to do, due to our father's absence from her life really messing her up. I was happy that she contacted me, and really nervous. We exchanged several messages, each describing what the other does,etc. After a while, I noticed that we had a lot of similarities (Her and I are both artists, not particularly feminine, etc. We even look similar.), and said as much thinking it would be a nice thing to say. Apparently it wasn't, because she hasn't contacted me since. Maybe she felt that if we're so similar, why did I get to be raised by my dad and she didn't. That thought didn't occur to me at the time, and now I deeply regret saying anything about how we're similar. After not hearing from her for a month, I wished her a merry christmas, and then it's been radio silence since then. 

The other day I was curious and went on her facebook (we're not facebook friends), and noticed that she had given birth to a beautiful baby girl. I'm an Aunt (or...Half-Aunt?), but I'll probably never be called Aunt by that child. I've always thought about my half-Siblings, but the last 3 years, since she reached out, I've thought about them more frequently, and would really love to get to know them. I hesitate to contact Tara again though, because I'm afraid she'll become sad or angry, or resentful of me. I'm sad that I don't know her, my Niece or my other Half-Sister, Tina. I would love to maybe one day call them family. Hell, I would love to just call them friends. I understand that family would probably be too much for them. 

I just...I'm not sure what to do in this situation. I don't want them to resent me, but at the same time I desperately want them to be a part of my life.

We both worked extremely hard to get where we are, both working our asses off to get ahead in our respective fields. I'm on my way to becoming a certified midwife. He is an allergist at a private practice just outside of the city. We have a four-year-old son. I'm proud of our earnings and accomplishments and I can say, with pride, that we do well for ourselves. We have a nice four bedroom house that we've decorated to our liking, our son is well taken care of when we're at work, we take family trips often - we're not uncomfortable by any means.

To the problem: there's a guy who begs near our house. Our house is kind of on a side street, connected to a major street. This guy usually sits on the corner of our street and the major street, holding a Tired, Hungry, Homeless - anything helps sign. He was never aggressive when we walked by him, he'd just sit there. We never really paid much attention to him, I think I may have given him a sandwich or two and a couple of coffees when we first moved to the area. But that was it. 

So, last Thursday, my partner texted me when I was on my way back from work. He was already home. The conversation was him basically asking whether it'd be okay for him to invite said homeless guy over for dinner. No explanation, just asking if it'd be okay if he could have some food at our house. I thought it was weird. I called him, and it sounded innocent enough. He just felt bad because it had been an extremely hot day and the guy looked raggedy and worn out and like he hadn't eaten. I said no, that's weird, we don't know him (as I read this, I realize I sound like a total bitch.) That's where the conversation ended. He agreed. 

Well, when I finally got home, I was in for a surprise. Homeless guy was out in the garage with my partner. He had already come over, even though I said I wasn't comfortable with it. I was fuming. I pulled him aside, kind of still in shock by his complete disregard for what I had said earlier. He promised it'd only be for this one time, the guy wouldn't be staying. For the sake of our son, who was playing in front of our house, I decided not to throw a hissy fit. I bit my tongue and went inside to finish dinner up. They stayed outside until dinner was ready. During dinner, he was nice enough. Didn't talk much. Seemed appreciative. They mostly talked about cars (partner has a thing for old cars, he's got two in the garage he's been working on for years.) He ended up leaving after dinner. 

We had an argument after that. He kept saying I was inconsiderate and that we should be happy to share our wealth with the needy, that this should never have been an issue, that he shouldn't have had to ask me for permission to bring this guy home. It was never resolved. We went to bed angry at each other, something I hate and avoid at all costs. We didn't talk much the next day, and I have to admit - I was kind of standoffish and giving him one word answers when he would text me throughout the day. That was Friday. 

Friday night, I got home, ready to start dinner in the backyard. Doorbell rings. It's the homeless guy. He was hoping he we could give him a bit of whatever we were having to eat. He was apologetic and clearly embarrassed. My partner wasn't home yet and dinner wasn't ready yet, so I awkwardly asked him to come to the backyard and wait till I had a few pieces of meat ready from the grill. He waited until stuff was ready and I made him a burger and he left. When my partner got home, another argument ensued. He still couldn't see anything wrong with this situation.

Saturday night, we had plans to see my parents so we weren't home for dinner. For all I know, homeless guy could have come over and rang the doorbell. Sunday night, he was back again. This time, I told him I wouldn't be able to keep giving him food and that I didn't appreciate him coming to our house. Partner wasn't home. I gave him some chicken and stuffing anyway, but told him not to keep coming back. 

Yesterday, I stayed late at work. Partner contacted me around dinnertime saying that he had given the guy peanut butter and jam. This resulted in a heated argument. He called me some nasty names and got angry. I told him he was not our charity case, we don't know his background or who he actually is. That he's being inconsiderate and stupid, that our son plays in the front yard all the time and who knows if this guy will come around again and start up conversations with him and what that could potentially lead to. It didn't end well and nothing really got resolved. I came home late, put our son to bed and went to bed myself. We haven't spoken since then. He got up extra early and went to the gym without kissing me goodbye in the morning or saying anything. He's ignoring my attempts to contact him. I've told this guy to not come back anymore, but clearly my partner has some sort of attachment to him for whatever reason. He's being very weird. I don't know what's gotten into him. I don't know what to do. He refuses to talk. 

**TL;DR - my partner brought home a homeless man for dinner. Homeless man keeps coming over for dinner now. Partner won't budge and believes we should keep feeding him even though I'm scared for our safety.** ",My [31F] partner [35M] of 6 years brought home a homeless guy who now keeps coming over.

11661,Relationships,2h19u4,"Last week, I told my boyfriend I was headed to a friend's housewarming party on Friday. Friday nights are usually us nights, so I felt it was only polite to ask if it were okay. He was disgruntled, said I was bad at keeping promises, and wanted to know when I'd be home. I said 11:30.

But after I'd actually arrived, I really wanted to stay and spend more time with my friend, since she recently graduated and I'll hardly have the time to see her anymore. I ended up texting my boyfriend, asking if I could stay another 30 minutes. He begrudgingly accepted. Then I wanted to stay longer...he got upset, asked to speak with me over the phone, and pleaded for me to come home.

So I did. But I was very upset - I knew in my gut this was wrong. My friends took this opportunity to confess that they felt I was being abused, and that I should seriously consider breaking up with him. (This isn't the first time I've had to leave friends because of an imposed deadline.)

I brought my concerns to him. After some discussion, he broke down in tears, apologized, said I was right, and started berating himself. He said he would seek counseling immediately and promised to do everything in his power to be better, saying that he couldn't imagine ever hurting me to this extent and that he was so, so sorry.

I know this sounds incredibly stupid, but he's been supportive in every other way. He doesn't restrict who I spend time with (unless that person is an ex), nor does he completely forbid me from seeing my friends. He doesn't control how I dress, he's NEVER insulted me personally or attempted to dictate my personality. I've never felt this deeply about someone in my life, and I am so tempted to consider this just another miscommunication, just another example of me not keeping my promises.

**edit**: I realized I didn't expand upon his OCD. He was actually diagnosed with OCD and clinical anxiety; he doesn't really exhibit physical patterns or compulsions as a typical person with OCD would. He instead has obsessive thoughts, and is very inflexible when it comes to plans. For example, if I playfully say that I was hoping to try a new restaurant with him for the first time, but if I later went with my parents when they were visiting, he'd be upset.","I [20 F] may be in an abusive relationship with my boyfriend [21 M], who was diagnosed with OCD. 1.5 years",0.0,False,4.0,8.0,1411309072.0,/r/relationships/comments/2h19u4/i_20_f_may_be_in_an_abusive_relationship_with_my/,Romantic

I left my girlfriend about a year ago, we had a pretty rough time and trust issues developed basically ending with a mutual agreement to not see eachother anymore. We were together for about 2 years.

My problem is that, I haven't really dated since, just one night stands. I have such a strong desire to love someone, yet all I can possibly feel for myself and other people is hostility.

I'm not sure why I feel this way, because I truly couldn't care about what she's doing now, and have no feelings for her whatsoever. I'm 100% over her, I just don't know where to go from here.

I've had this really deep sense of loneliness since I've been without her, and it's just making me become more and more bitter.

It's kind of a vicious cycle. I think I need someone to help me learn to love again, and lose the bitterness. But the bitterness prevents me from really ever being with anyone.

If anyone can share some advice on this, I'd be grateful.

Ever since, we have been visiting each other and always have a great time together. We are no longer boyfrirnd and girlfriend and are able to meet new people. We have not met anybody though. 



I'm at her house now after a great week together and will be going home tonight. As always, she has been getting a lot more emotional about the whole situation than me. I've pretty much said lets just see what happens. If one of us meets another person then so be it.

Anyway, it wasn't the best of times, the ratio of happy times to bad were about 100:1.

Every day he asks me if I've cheated on him. He constantly claims I put my friends before him when I hang out with him almost every day during the week. He can be sweet one minute and angry the next. Our fights are huge and he gets very angry during them. Our fights have been happening more frequently in the past few months, and I've been getting the feeling that this whole relationship is unhealthy for me and I need to leave. 

The problem is, whenever I try he cries and begs me to stay because he needs me, and I always give in. As much as I tell myself that this time I will be strong I can't leave him when he begins to cry, it hurts me too much to hurt another person like that. He tells me everything will change and he'll work on his personality when I know that nothing ever will. I just don't want to hurt him even though I know it'll be inevitable.

He also is a very popular person in our school, and is mutual friends with a lot of my friends. I'm afraid that I will not only lose a person I've been spending almost every day with for the past year but a lot of the people I'm friends with, and I'm afraid of being completely alone. I'm afraid of leaving him because when you spend so much time with one person and suddenly they're gone it hurts, regardless of who they were. 

Lastly, I'm afraid I'm going to regret my decision of leaving him. Every day is a struggle for me to please him, but what if he really can change? What if I am the bad guy for wanting to end this? I just don't know what to do anymore.

okay. im in a bit of a rage right now so sorry if this is a bit confusing. 

basically me and my serious boyfriend come from very, very different backgrounds. I come from a family that has always fostered independence and confidence. We also never had very much money so financially i am completely on my own. (full student loans, working full time to pay for university) they are awesome, i love them and i definetly think that being able to grow up and fend for myself, while also having guidance from them has made me a happy and independent individual. 


HIS FAMILY, i love them dearly. they are very sweet people but just a very different background then myself. Hes got all of his schooling paid for, his parents are loaded and basically since he relies on them for his rent / schooling and whatnot, they have much more of a say in his decisions compared to my parents. From my perspective they are micro managing his life while i dont think that it is helping him grow as an individual at all. for example, they plan and use their connections to get him jobs, do house hunting for him and his mom even plans his classes for him at university.

MY BIGGEST PROBLEM. we have made the decision to move in together next year (beggining in august) and his mother is waaaayyy to involved. she has begun emailing me, choosing places for us to look at and when i express that i dont want to be living in a certain location, she just said that her and her husband beleive it would be best for my boyfriend if he was closer to the university. even though i have a job downtown that i need easily access as well as attending university ( 20 minute busride tops from town to the uni so i honestly dont see the problem)

11670,Relationships,2nao2c,"So this is gonna be interesting to type out to a bunch of strangers, here goes!

Little back story, me and my friend, let's call him Greg, met a bunch of years ago and instantly have had an unbreakable bromance, we literally finish each others sentences and can communicate without ever saying a word, it's pretty amazing. I've never had a friend like him at all. So time passes and about a year ago Greg meets  this awesome girl who he clicked with instantly we will call her Sam.  She is exactly my type as well, and since me and Greg are so close, it was inevitable that me and  Sam would get to know each other quite well..

 Well it wasn't long before sparks between me and Sam were obvious, we hung out more and more, a lot of times without Greg. The chemistry between us is palpable, she has admitted she loves me multiple times and she knows I love her. I have even gone so far as to tell Greg I was in love with her. Being the awesome friend he is, he still allows me to hang with her although his jealousy is becoming quite evident. 

Me and Sam have had some physical interactions I know Greg would not approve of, nothing past hand holding, cuddling and minor caressing , never even a kiss, though we have both had to stop ourselves on more than one occasion from locking lips. If we ever did kiss I know it would snowball instantly into crazy, unstoppable, passionate physicality, I  am sure she realizes this as well, so we skirt the line... 

This has been going on for over nine months now, me and Sam locking eyes and trading incredible energy, embracing secretly when Greg is in the other room... It's extremely passionate, we can communicate and read each others minds even more than me and Greg ever could. The problem arises when it is clear that Sam is scared to admit her feelings for me to Greg. Deep down I'm sure he knows but he will never consciously admit it, and since she will not tell, it is a moot point. 

 So here I am in love with two people, one my best friend, an entirely platonic heterosexual love, and the other his girlfriend and it is anything but platonic... I would love to have a poly relationship with them like no other, but I come from a poly upbringing and see it as feasible, while she may, he does not..  I don't feel like me and him would compete for her were it to happen, we could love each other in different ways and be better than just a couple of friends, I see that the dynamic is already there, I just don't know if it will ever be recognized.
 All I know is it that it's starting to hurt. 

Should I leave them both behind and start a new life somewhere else? Should I do something else? I'm at a loss.. I can't imagine my life without either of them, but I can't imagine it continuing on like this forever either.  I want to stay and not lose the connections we have, but I'm so deep in love with her I don't think I can stay without doing something.. If I do stay I'll never be able to be with someone else honestly because she fills my mind constantly. I was hoping it was just an infatuation.. But at this point I know it's not...

8 months ago, Reddit, I cheated. I slept with another man. I decided to break up with my boyfriend as a result, using those stupid bullshit reasons. I ran to the other guy, and my boyfriend saw us. He didn't know about before, he assumed it was because of all the drama of the break up.

I wasn't strong enough to walk away. I was devastated about what I'd done to him and was convinced that maybe I could bury it and be the amazing person he believes me to be and I want to be.

I suppressed and buried, hard. But the guilt ate me alive. I cried every day, considered throwing myself in front of a train, etc. etc. Still convinced I was doing the right thing, not burdening him with the pain. It's funny how much online you can find telling you to do that when you really are looking for it.

He proposes. I am distraught, because he should be marrying someone better. Someone who didn't do this to him. Throughout this, we don't deal with the infidelity. I keep lying. I wasn't doing anything, but I would still see the other guy in meetings and not tell him. A month back, we kissed again. The other guy is in love with me. I have no idea what I want.

Then, a few weeks ago, something snapped. I couldn't deal with it anymore. I couldn't even look at my fiance without being reminded what a piece of shit I am. I couldn't deal with the way he looked at me. I just wanted out. As fast as possible. So I broke his heart again, and ran. Told him I was scared of marriage and lack of communication.

I'm at home. Back with my parents. I slept with the other guy again. I have no idea why. I miss my ex so much but I don't think it's salvageable. I've booked into counselling to work out why on earth I did this, why I sabotaged a perfect relationship and then continued to fuck him about for months. I feel like I shouldn't be with anybody until I can show some fucking respect.

I know I'm a horrible person. My question is...do I come clean about it?

I am not sure if I will just be called a selfish and insecure person for this, but I really do not know what to do.  Or if there is anything to do.  I do like him, so I am trying to change my inner self but it's not working yet.

11676,Relationships,26bmca,"My husband proposed to me after a year of dating, about a month after we found out I was pregnant. 

We've been together for six years, married for nearly five. We have a four-year-old boy. 

Things haven't been awesome for a long time. After different strings of unemployment for both of us, we've been living in varying degrees of poverty basically since we've been together. We've moved in with each set of parents, we're close to defaulting on loans, and the stress of all of it is just insane. For a long time, it was easy to point to outside stressors - money, moving, jobs, etc - as the problems in our relationship. But it's not that, we just don't work together. It's taken me a long time to see it. There are times when we're happy together, but *most of the time*, we can't stand each other. We're just not in love anymore. I don't love him. I loved him when we were dating, I loved him when we were married. I just don't love him anymore.



1. He's grossly obese. More than that, he has no motivation to change. I'm not thin, and I definitely need to lose weight. To that end, I exercise as often as I can, walking in the evenings 3-4 times a week, and I try to make healthy food choices. He does not exercise at all, despite my urging and support. He's on several medications (adding to our financial burdens) that could all be stopped if he lost weight. He's very tall, and he's pushing 360 lbs. When I bring it up, he grunts something about joining a gym (which we can't afford) and refuses to try any exercise regimen that doesn't require a gym membership.

2. He's not an involved parent. I do 100% of the parenting in our household. At the moment, I'm unemployed, so I'm fine with taking a larger part of all of the household duties. But my husband gets up nearly an hour after our son does, throws on some clothes, and goes to work - not eating breakfast with us, not talking to our son besides goodbye. He comes home, eats dinner with us (in front of the television, he insists, and usually something besides the dinner I've prepared) and usually doesn't ask our son what he did during the day or show any interest unless I prod and nag him to do so. If I request to sleep in on the weekends, I'll come out of our bedroom after an hour or two to find my husband sleeping or dozing on the couch while our son is lounging in his pajamas with an electronic toy with Mythbusters blaring in the background. 

3. He doesn't seem to really care about me. He rarely speaks to me, only as an afterthought. He never says my name, where I say his constantly. He has no desire to actually spend any time with me that doesn't involve television or gaming on his phone (which I am very close to breaking in half at this point). I try to get us involved in other activities, but he isn't interested. In the evenings after he gets home from work, he doesn't really seem to care if I'm in the room or not. 

These are all things I've brought up to him on a regular basis. He'll make a grand speech, or sometimes just a few sentences, that tells me he actually does want to change and he actually does love me and he actually does listen to me and take me seriously. He'll say oh, I'm depressed or oh, I'm overworked or he'll turn it around and suddenly I'm apologizing to *him*. 


I have my own issues. I really do. I struggle with social anxiety, depression, oh and there's probably a lot more there. I recently lost my job and suffered a miscarriage, and I don't think I could have made it through this without his support. I'm terrified at the idea of doing this life and parenting thing without him, but at the same time, I don't want to stay married to someone that I don't love. I don't think I can *afford* do to this on my own either. I have enough trouble holding down a job, I wouldn't able able to afford my own place, and he wouldn't be able to afford to support two households. When I put it like that, I just feel needy, like I'm holding onto this because he has a job that puts food on my table. 

Is this just the married life routine? I mean yeah, we have our happy moments. We have our good times. He's a great dad (when he wants to be) and he loves our son. Our sex life is great, and he tells me he wants to have another kid (although after this miscarriage, well, that's a whole nother can of worms). Sometimes I can't believe I'm still here and I don't want to spend another day with him. Other times my problems seem petty and ridiculous. I saw a quote from somebody that said basically that everyone has their faults, and you just have to pick someone whose faults you can live with. 

Or is this just depression? I'm not happy with our relationship, but I'm not really happy with much these days. Is it really my issues that I'm projecting onto the relationship? Or am I dumb for thinking that that overwhelming love and affection that you feel for a person stays with you for the whole relationship?

I care for her, she cared for me, we had a mutual appreciation for each other and lived life like a couple. She recently started dating my friend, the one who just wants to fuck her, he told her that he loved her and she pursued him. 

It crushed me, we were a couple without the title, we lived together, we did everything together, and she threw it all away for a guy she barely knew and was repulsed by. I tried to be cool, I tried to be okay with it, and I was. I was okay with it, I understood what she wanted to do. But this was the end.


I got pissed okay, we went from talking everyday, spending everyday together, to not even speaking to each other. She'd crash in my bed as usual, but told me to fuck off. So I'd been crashing on the couch while she takes my bed. Our only conversations were when I was talking to my mate, and she'd butt in with a comment. So I told her the truth, that I felt alone. This sparked a conversation, where she brought up the fact that she was crying because my friend of 10 years told her he'd given up on her because she refused to go the doctor for a cold, when he demanded she go. I was infuriated. I ranted and raved and cried because he was just toying with her, but SHE felt obliged to apologise, she thought she'd hurt him so she apologised for the next 3 days.


But it doesn't stop there. One night I got blackout drunk, and started talking to her. I told her that what she'd done to me was fucked up, that removing me from her life in the matter of a day after everything we went through together was fucked. I told her that I was sick of this shit, that if she couldn't even converse with me than she should just leave. Leave my house, leave my life, just to fuck off. I told her she was what she had always hated, that she'd turned into the person she was when she met me. 


So she did, she left. She moved in with my mate, and since then he's been manipulating her to get his own way, and hurting her emotionally beyond belief.  Since then neither of them have agreed to talk to me civilly unless we're hanging out with the entirety of the group. 


Now I know it seems that I expected her to love me, but that wasn't it. I understood that she had feelings for someone else, but as soon as she picked up my friend as a boyfriend she stopped talking to me. Not even a Hi in the afternoons, not even a Thank you after I made breakfast. Within a day she had cut me out of her life completely and wouldn't even converse with me.
I understand not wanting to talk intimately with someone because they're in a relationship with someone else, but she wouldn't talk to me at all.

Without going into detail about who said what in these fights or other specifics, I'm going to explain how I came to the conclusion that I am possibly contributing (if not a root cause) for our problems along with some questions about the thoughts in my head.  There is a lot to take in, so I apologize for the length.

Since birth, I've existed in a world where women have been allowed to take advantage of me.  Notice I said allowed.  My mother came from a broken home; and to make matters worse, her father was a diagnosed schizophrenic.  My father came from a well-to-do family but his parents had relationship issues.  They did stay married, however, until my grandmother (his mother) passed away from ovarian cancer in her mid-60s.  My parents got married and had my brother (younger) and me.  Their marriage was unstable at best.  My mother suffered from many ailments which was intended to garner attention and pity.  I later learned this behavior was related to her Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) she was diagnosed with when my parents got divorced (I was 10 y/o at the time).  During the custody battle between my parents, my brother and I were subjected to MANY dysfunctional behaviors, overwhelmingly from my mentally ill mother.  My mother used us as tools to exact revenge on my father and, in a fit of rage one day, tried to run him down in a parking lot with us in the car.  Needless to say, the court appointed a psychologist for us to visit regularly to mitigate mental instability.  While I managed to avoid BPD, I still took away issues that have haunted me.  My high school years appeared pretty normal.  Argued with my dad over rebellious (see: immature) ideas.  Dated girls, etc.  But now looking back at it...I stayed in relationships longer than I needed to and made myself a doormat by being clingy/desperate.  This ultimately led to me being cheated on twice and helped instill further skepticism of women's intentions; not to mention, fulfill the prophecy that I would be abandoned.  At this point, I took on a more misogynist conviction and began to masturbate to pornography regularly.  Naturally, I began to view women as a means to an end.  (SIDE NOTE:  Ironically, I did and always have had more female friends than male.)

I spent most of my college years focusing on my studies, very rarely dating.  A majority of my sexual experiences were relegated to masturbation, though I did have a one-night stand with an older woman.  After college, I moved to a nearby city and started a FWB relationship with a co-worker.  This went on for a couple of years until I ended things because I was ready to be in a relationship.  It was around this time I began looking for a house and settling down.  Within a few months I found a house and began closing on it.  During that time I also met a young woman that I was absolutely enamored with.  The relationship started out as being intense and exciting, as they always do, but quickly became unstable.  Crazy-making, huge blowout fights that typically resulted in painful accusations and denigration (from her), and using sex as a weapon became the norm.  Foolishly, I was anxious to settle down and was not objective enough about the relationship to see the incredible dysfunction that existed...so I got engaged to her.  I assumed that it was normal to have tough times in a relationship.  Later I would painfully break off the relationship, only to realize that I had been involved with someone who suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).  Through the immense therapy I sought afterwards, I also discovered my own dysfunction I brought into that relationship from my childhood...co-dependency.  There were some good and bad things that resulted from therapy.  The good was that I had begun to move on from the addiction of being in THAT chaotic relationship.  The bad would later emerge when I got involved with another woman a year later (who I am currently dating).

My current girlfriend is completely different from my last.  Whereas my ex's family was unstable (father is suspected of Narcissistic Personality Disorder), my current girlfriend's is about as Leave it to Beaver as you can get.  They, on the whole, communicate well, are sincere, and are very loving/warm to each other.  Because she grew up in this type of environment, my girlfriend is also very warm and loving.  And she's an extrovert; I am definitely not.  So when it comes to openness, I feel awkward.  when it comes to emotions, I am indifferent.  That's not to say I don't have emotions at times, but I find it difficult to understand her emotions for various things.  That said, I am a ham.  I crack jokes constantly and have the all or nothing mentality when it comes to topics I joke about.  She does not share this sentiment and often, it seems, she gets upset about them.  Sometimes these offensive jokes are poking fun at her, other times it's about something or someone on TV, etc.  While I don't try to be offensive, it feels like she perceives many things I say in that manner.  The end result is that she gets upset with me about what I said and I go on the defensive.  Unfortunately, I have a tendency to be unfiltered and I tell her that she's overreacting/needs to learn how to take (and dish out) jokes.

That all said, there are several things that concern me:
1) The saying goes that your lifelong partner should be your best friend.  I feel like I should be able to say/joke about the same things around my girlfriend that I do with my best guy friend, no?  How many of you act completely different around your best friends than you do your significant other?
2) When we were at an animal hospital, recently, with a sick cat a couple came out of an exam room and the woman was sobbing.  My girlfriend felt pain and immense sadness but I just kind of felt pity for the lady.  I was not moved by that woman's display of emotion...at all.  Why can't I feel the same emotions my girlfriend does?  Am I over-analyzing my emotions or should I be concerned?
3) I've often heard that comedy is used to soothe pain.  I don't feel like I live in pain but at the same time I know I still harbor bitterness over decisions I've made in relationships.  Anyone that has been through or knows of someone that has been through a BPD relationship...is this a common way to suppress issues?
4) Why am I attracted to instability and chaos while I KNOW stable, healthy relationships are what is needed to have a great environment to raise a family?  Why do I want exciting, dispensable women that I know cannot provide a stable home life?

11681,Relationships,28zdhy,"My boyfriend and I have been together close to a year. 2 1/2 months ago we move to a new city and moved in together for the first time. It's mostly been a total blast so far- discovering a new place together, feeling really happy with the home we've created. That said, there are some lingering issues with sex that I had sort if anticipated pre-move.


My sexual background is much more... exploratory than his is, although his experience is more vast (he was single for a long time, I've mostly been in long term relationships with kinky people). I very much know what I'm into- I love being dominated, and I like having sex often. Like multiple times a day. The first thing I want to do when I wake up is have sex, and if I don't get off when I wake up, I am most certainly thinking about it, hoping it will happen before we go to sleep. He seems to be a once a day, maybe twice if I push it. 


My issues since we've moved in together have a lot to do with synching up our libidos. It has been much weirder than I expected in terms of our maaturbation schedules being thrown off. I assume that he, like most men, jerks off once a day. I've point-blank asked him when he does it, and he says in the shower sometimes, not really all that much anymore. Well... I have a hard time believing that. Mostly, because when I go to type in xvid... Or youp... on our shared computer, plenty on non-deleted browser history pops up. He does it every time I'm not at the house.


Here's the thing- I think masturbation is awesome! And I would never judge how much or how little he is doing it. My issue is that I feel like I'm not satisfied with the amount of sex I'm getting, including masturbation, and when he jerks off a couple times a day without having sex with me... I feel neglected. I've had 3 conversations with him about my sex drive, my needs, and how sex is an important stress relief for me. For a few days after these convos, he puts in a real effort. He'll incorporate some bdsm stuff that he's comfortable with (pulling hair, spanking, etc). We'll have some 2 and 3 times a day runs. It's great. Then it just goes back to normal. 


I've asked him if he's feeling satisfied, or what I can do to help get us on the same page, and he seems fine with less sex. I don't want to pressure him, which will only lead to anxiety and even less sex. I feel like I communicate with him in the most sensitive and open ways. We have a ton of respect for one another. I'm just starting to feel like the person I want to spend the rest of my life with just isn't enough like me in the bedroom.


What can I do to either a.) accept that this will be our sex life from now on, or b.) help myself find satisfaction in some other way?

I decided to use a throwaway account for this as I'm a paranoid idiot and am currently facing away from any windows.

Anyway, now that you know a little bit about me, I feel I should jump right into my story. 

About a year ago I started becoming really good friends with a girl I'd had a petty crush on since freshman year (currently going into senior), and within a few months we were well on our way to becoming best friends. I told her about a month into our friendship that I was interested in her, and she said that she didn't want to ruin our friendship. Oh well, friend-zoned, I should just cut my losses and move on-- is what I should have thought. A month later, I told her I liked her again, and got a similar response. 

Fast-forward ten months and we've recently become much closer. We hang out alone on a regular basis which consists of going to my house when no one is home and talking alone in my room-- revealing secrets to each other that we've never told anyone else. Starting out these talks we would simply be chatting which escalated to massaging which escalated to holding and to hugging and finally to cliche boyfriend/girlfriend cuddling-- with my arm around her and hers across my chest. We text every day generally for 9-10 hours, and I was beginning to think that I actually had a chance with what I see as the perfect girl for me. 

Unfortunately I'm not sure if she feels anything for me. She took a liking to an anonymous person awhile back, and today she said that she would be meeting up with her other good friend and him. I asked her if she still liked him, and she said she did.

At this point my hope has been like a roller-coaster... it was at it's highest high and now it's lowest low. I'm not sure what to make of all of this, so I'm looking to this subreddit for any sort of advice possible. I realize of course that I'm only 17 and I don't know as much as I should to say this, but either I'm still in deep infatuation or I can't stop loving her. 

I'd like to thank everyone who took the time to read and try to find possible solutions to my problem, after she told me she still liked him I told her that I was going to bed early and I'm not sure if that was the best route. 

Help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

They met years ago when they were both still working at the same place (now they live apart on opposite parts of the country). She really does seem to be a genuinely kind person with a lot of similar traits to my BF and they do get along very well. They used to spend LOTS of time together: at their workplace, traveling abroad, spending weekends together sailing, etc. As I understand it, she helped him through a lot of difficult times, including when he came out of the closet (at the age of 27), which was a huge step for him. So in that way, she has certainly been there for him in the past and played an important role in his life. 


However, I learned that at some point after he came out (when he was still figuring things out in regards to his sexuality), they both tried to make something work between them and date each other. It ended quickly after two or three weeks and afterwards they just went right back to being friends, which to me seems like a bad idea, because now she apparently harbors feelings for him that he definitely cannot reciprocate.


Ever since I have come into the picture, she has been a bit standoffish towards me. The first time we met we were at a big concert party in my city together with my BF and few other friends of hers (admittedly not the best place to get to know someone) and she ignored me for most of the evening. Despite her behavior, I have still wanted to make efforts to be nice to her, since I know she means a lot to my BF. Most recently, however, she told my BF specifically not to bring me with him to her birthday party, where over 50 people were invited and everyone else was allowed to bring their plus one. She said she would have felt obligated to get to know me and that would have been difficult to do at the party. Eventually she relented after another friend of hers convinced her otherwise. At the party, she was a bit touchy-feely with my BF, going to hold his hand, initiating dances with him and even calling him honey. Maybe I am blind but I wasn't sure how to take all of that. Was all of that just a form of overt friendliness or was it a sign of deeper affection? It is becoming difficult for me to read her intentions.


She doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that my BF is now in a happy and strong relationship. On top of that, she also seems to resent me for stealing time away from her and my BF. 


All the while, my BF seems a bit aloof about the fact that he might be accidentally leading her on a bit. For example, they are both going to attend a dance course together in his city this weekend and she will stay over at his place. Now I have been told that they are both going to be sleeping together in the same bed! (On the other hand, my BF does not even have much furniture at his apartment and doesn't have a spare sofa for her to sleep on either). I guess ordinarily this wouldn't be so bad if it just weren't for the fact that she's not over him...

11687,Relationships,1mque3,"We met each other online in May and have slowly progressed to a real, fun relationship. We have the same sense of humour and enjoy a lot of the same activities. Lately she's been acting a little distant and not really reciprocating very much affection. I brought it up to her the other night and basically she said that she feels like there's an imbalance in the relationship. I like her a lot and show her tons of affection, but she says she thinks there is some kind of wall that she's built up over time and she is having a hard time letting me in.

She was celibate and single for about 2 years before we met so I think intimacy issues might be part of it. But, she also said that she feels something missing and she wasn't sure that she really wanted a serious relationship.

The day after this conversation she apologized for being so distant but clarified that she really likes being with me. I told her that if she wanted some time to figure things out we can spend some time apart; so we chose to take a week off. It's now only day 2 and I want answers desperately.

Is this crazy for me to even consider taking time off at this point? I really like this girl, but if she's this unsure and uncommunicative at this point should I just bail? She's the first girl that I've met in a long time who I really enjoy being with so it's tough to give it up, but maybe this is a red flag that I want to ignore but shouldn't.

11688,Relationships,1hoflt,"So here's my problem. I'm just a 21 year old college student. I met a 22 year old college student at a bar. He's really awesome, interning at a large company in Seattle. Problem is, he doesn't go to the local university here. He's from a college out of state, and he's going to go back mid-August to finish his last semester of college. We've only known each other for a couple weeks. 

I've met up with him, had sex with him a could times. I went to the gym with him. We just have a good time hanging out. First time I spent the night at his place, he invited me to come over for Sunday dinner. I'm pretty sure he's just being nice, after we had sex for the first time. 

Whenever we're together with his friends, he treats me like a friend. He is distant, so I'm 90% positive that this is just going to be a summer fling. Just last time, when I was getting ready to go home, he was teasing me/being flirty. It's only when we're alone. 

Early yesterday (7/3), when we were texting, he reminded me the previous night (7/2) that he and his roommates were having dinner and asked me to come over. I was studying for a class, so I told him maybe. He responded with okay, when all the other texts were really flirty. When I asked if he was upset, he said no, why would I be. I don't know if he was really upset, or if he doesn't care.

Yesterday, I went to his house and helped his roommate make dinner. She was asking him and their other roommate to pick up something from the store. They were both being really obnoxious to her, so I pulled him to the side and asked him if he could, and he said Yeah, I will, and they left within the next few minutes. I don't know if they left because they were postponing for 30minutes, or because I asked him. 

Today, he seemed a little upset that I couldn't come out tonight to watch the fireworks with him and his friends. But seemed like he shrugged it off. I'm pretty sure he was being polite, but as I was waiting for my ride in the morning, his roommates were leaving. My ride was a few minutes late, so everyone was kind of telling him to hurry up. He just said he wasn't going to let me wait outside his house for my ride. 

I invited him out to my friend's birthday next weekend, and he seemed pretty happy to go out. So we'll see.

We had to walk about 10 minutes in order to get to her place and do the dead. On this walk we started talking and we instantly clicked. Or at least from my perspective we did. 
At one point we were walking down a sidewalk and there were a small group of people in front of us. We were so engrossed in the conversation that we almost walk right into them. I hadn't ever hit it off so well with any girl before in my life. 

If we both didn't have sex on our mind, I think we would have stayed up all night just talking.

A few hours after I left, I texted her and said that i had a really great time and she responded saying she did also.

So my question is should I try to get to know her better? Ask her to get coffee or just to stay over again?

11691,Dating,2d2696,"So this girl and I have known each other for about two years now and have grown to be very close. We had amazing chemistry from the start and couldn't help but fall for each other. I would have started this transition into an actual relationship at this point, but at the time I thought that if we were going to be together it wasn't going to last very long; I thought our differences were going to eventually tear us apart. I didn't want that and I knew that she wouldn't either, so I decided not to take things any further.

Nine months or so later, she ended up in a relationship with another guy. I wasn't too bummed out about this or anything at this point because I had already had my mind set on just being friends. She ended up being unhappy with the guy she was with after a short period of time, although their relationship stretched out to a little over a year before she finally ended things with him. 

As time went on, the whole Thinking things wouldn't last thing seemed more and more stupid to me the more I thought about it. The entire time she was with him, her and I continued to to talk and eventually started hanging out together, which became more and more frequent. We would even flirt with each other a little bit every now and then as well, and the more we talked the more I ended up wanting her. I know she felt the same way as well. 

One day we ended up on the topic of why I never asked her out when we were first getting to know each other, and I told her the truth but kept it short by saying that I knew things wouldn't last. She ended up telling me that she still felt strongly attracted to me and was more interested in me than her own boyfriend. I didn't know how to feel about this and decided to keep my mouth shut in order to not cause problems. 

At this point she's been single for almost two months and I'd really like for us to be together. It's just difficult going past that boundary line that was once there because of her having a boyfriend, and I don't know what the best way to do that would be. I don't know if I should tell her how I feel and tell her I want to be with her AND THEN cross that boundary line (ie. flirting, kissing, cuddling, etc.), or cross that boundary line first and then tell her how I feel.

I have to postpone that because my mother passed away last month, my father passed away to blood cancer a few years back, and my mother to an aneurysm a month ago.

This happened the same month but I haven't been in the best mindset to deal with it so I've put it off until now. 

My mother passed away on the 6th last month. She lives in the UK so I went to be with my family and support them and myself for a while. My girlfriend didn't come along as it was a last minute flight and she had just flown out to Vancouver for business.

I was with my family, essentially just my 2 brothers and some cousins, for 2 weeks, I came back to get some belongings so I can relocate there for a month or so. My girlfriend knew I was coming back and was going to come with me.

There wasn't any car in my driveway or shoes on my porch, I wasn't expecting anyone to be home anyways. I came home around 1am and walked straight into our bedroom and she was sleeping there with some other guy. 

I didn't wake her up or anything and I've been at a hotel every since. She's been calling me for weeks but I can't answer.

Then something happened. We got a house together (He paid most of the down payment, I was to take care of most of the mortgage until I could afford to contribute more) in my favorite area (a huge concession for him), and he moved in right away. It was the sweetest gift I'd ever received, but we had had communications issues- they started to get worse, and our arguments were getting worse. I explained I was ready to move in but I wanted to work on communication before I moved in with him. After a few months of things getting better and sometimes getting worse, he decided I had betrayed him and abandoned him. I explained I still wanted to move in- this was totally my bad and I'm sorry I'd made him wait so long. He called it a betrayal, a step down from cheating, and became horrible. HORRIBLE. We went to therapy, and he called the therapist Doc and disagreed with him in an aggressive way. Suddenly he was terrifying, cold, awful.

It's the kind of thing- if I point out he's being mean, he says, If you call me mean, I'm just going to be meaner. I've told him I'm terrified of him and he doesn't show any concern, but rather a sense of satisfaction. He calls me unreasonable, irrational, and for awhile brought up his friends, saying they totally agree with him. Once he brought up my friend, twisting her words from You're both Type A to She said you're type A and Being around her makes me (friend) want to be a better person. to She said being around you is difficult.

Hey /r/relationships!

So, I've been in a relationship for two years now. 

However, it's become a long distance relationship (internationally) around 3-4 months back with no actual confirmed date for when we are going to see each other again (we still talk over text daily, call occasionally etc.) which makes life somewhat shitty at times.


We were set up by a mutual friend at the time (their Mom's are friends and the friend who set us up is in my circle of friends but didn't have much to do with me at the time and she doesn't really have much to do with my GF either to be honest, they're not what I'd call close friends.)


The strange thing that is confusing me is this friend, we'll call her Susie.


About a month after my GF left for her home country, I got a call from Susie asking me how I was doing, catching up, etc, which isn't really strange other than the fact that she'd never called me before and I didn't know she even had my number, but we talked for 20 minutes or so and went on our ways.


But as of the last two months or so she's been wanting to hang out, go out for coffee, go out for drinks and that sort of thing. 


There was a time a week or so back where she was meeting with a guy who she was interested in and they went out for drinks together with just the two of them and she called me up to come and join (what) as she'd been talking about me and the guy asked her about me, apparently saying he wanted to meet me (a little strange...) 


When I got there, she kinda stopped talking to the dude, saying he actually wasn't interested in her and they were just friends. The both of them kinda just kept talking to me rather than each other, which I thought was weird.


I ended up dropping her back to her place that night and I felt kinda bad for the dude. If some girl called out another dude to come hang with us while we were on a date then went home with him, I'd be a little sad.


She's started asking me to help with certain things in her life and if we are all going somewhere, she'll call me to ask if she can catch a ride with me when she could easily ask one of the other girls in the group like she used to (one of the girls is her best friend, who drives and lives close by to her).

11700,Relationships,37mjyz,"Oh! Where to begin? 
I’m 14 years married and I cannot stand my wife. The only thing that keeps me alive is my two daughters. I’ll try to start from the beginning.
My wife was previously married when I met her and now looking back at how she treated her ex-husband the warning signs were there but I was blinded by love or lust, can’t remember. We met in my home country and 6 months later I packed up and moved to hers. In my younger years I was really not a good decision maker. Kind of fly by the seat of your pants guy. Things started out pretty good and we had an apartment with the car she had from previous marriage. I got work as an illegal laborer while and things moved along. So I’m 5 months in the new country and she suggests we get married for the visa. I’m a dumb drunk 25 year old and go along with it so married we got. 2 months later she is pregnant and that’s when things slowly go downhill. I go from being her partner to her lapdog pretty quick. I didn’t fight it and am to blame also. I was stuck in a foreign country with zero support from anyone. I had no friends and if I did make a friend there was always something wrong with them.
I disliked this period so much that I fought having the second child for two and half years until one day she begged and promised it would be different second time around. I stupidly thought things would change so we had our second daughter. The emotional abuse got real bad at this point as her life became difficult with a 2.5 year old and a newborn. I was working a 9-5 by this time and she was on maternity leave. The sleep battles began soon after as she in her eyes deserved more than I did. I was eventually at the doctors with sleep deprivation. I was sleeping on the floor next to my youngest as my wife would not force her to cry it out. I was so tired I fell off the rocking chair with my daughter in my arms one night. This went on for a year and then my daughter figured out how to sleep through the night. During this period my wife constantly shouted, screamed, name called etc. I tried to get some sleep one evening before the shitty night and she dragged to covers of me when I lay on the bed. I tried to push her away with my foot and pull the covers back on but this was a physical assault with a 3 year guilt trip and 3 months of marriage counseling. I could never speak the truth about what was happening so it was 3 months of beat me up with the help of a counselor. 

The years go by and I have become an alcoholic to drown out the misery of what I had let my life become. We are probably 6 or 7 years in now. I had no self-respect left by this time and really didn’t give a fuck whether I lived or died. I basically went to work and dreaded going home. I hid away in my garage as much as I can to avoid the shit storms. All money is controlled by her and I’m supposed to buy smokes, beer, coffee etc with 30 bucks a week. If the money runs low it’s my fault and the emotional abuse starts again. During this period I got good at making money on the side by repairing and selling stuff. I would always lie about how much I made off the item so I could have money for myself. I have stooped as low as stealing from my own kid’s piggy bank to buy a pack of smokes. I tried many times to quit smoking but heaven forbid I have some issues while doing it. By this period of our marriage I’m not allowed to be sick, have any feelings or needs. Also at this point in the marriage I have become a pro liar. I can do it right to her face without issue. This will become relevant next paragraph.

So I’m still dragging myself along at 9 years in. At this point I’m forgetting anniversaries, not giving a shit about Christmas, birthdays etc. We are fighting all the time and I have started a mental rollercoaster. I go for a period where I resign to the abuse but then I rebel against it. This does not work so good, as now I have a mental disorder, as she put it. So now I am drinking myself to death slowly while popping meds and trying to deal with her all at the same time. After a couple months I stopped the meds but she did not know so I was a little better. They just made things worse for me as I was going to lose my job where I had the only freedom in my life. Well I should point out the freedom was in the minutes between her calling the fucking office for nothing. Sometimes up to 20 calls in a day. If I didn’t answer the office phone my cell would ring instantly. If I was allowed to go to the bar with the one friend I had my phone would ring before I drank the first pint. “Whose is there with you?” I knew I had to lie if there was a female even within 100 yards of me. 10 minutes later and she would call again. Oh and this only friend also had issues with my beloved. She hated his girlfriend. During this period I had started to let my cares go so low that my wife found out I was into viewing pron. This did not go down so good and she exploded causing hundreds of dollars of property damage. I was removed by the cops, who I called for my protection. I stayed at a friend’s house for a couple days with the intention to leave forever. She convinced my pussy ass that she was going to change and I missed my kids. So back to the grind I went as long as I agreed to do counseling for my new pron addiction. Little does she know that I have viewed said material ever since I was a teenager. Fuck knows what would have happened then. Ding Ding round two of beat me up, with the help of a female counselor this time.

I’m starting to wake up at this point but I’m still clouding it with beer. I have stock homes syndrome where I will defend her actions and protect her. I will make excuses not to go places with people as I would never be allowed to go anyway. We move to a new location and I think things will change but as usual they don’t and my drinking gets worse. The ultimatum arrive to me after I spend 2 months sleeping in our basement “quit drink or you’re out”. Fine! I quit the drink but that didn’t help as now the cloudiness in my head was clearing. While this was worse for me in dealing with her it also brought some clarity to what the fuck she was doing to me. I was horrified! I suddenly realized I was being emotionally abused to the point my kids thought I was a joke. 

So now I’m seeing counselor after counselor and they all tell me to leave her. But she’s smart and picks up on my changes and before you know it I have a new counselor. Finally I’m with a counselor that explains co-dependency to me and it’s like the light bulb just lit over my head. This counselor worked real well for a while until my wife found a problem with that one too. I did learn a lot during this time about how I was bullied. I’m still off the drink and coping with the day to day just fine. I am however still being bullied by my wife with the latest happening on front of the kids where I asked to separate the finances and put 50% each towards bills. This did not go down well as I earn more and it’s not fair. Divorce was threatened as a repercussion of pushing my idea. This was in front of my daughters so I backed down. Again! 
Another recent one was where I brought my kids to the store and my eldest had her own money and bought chocolate, skittles &amp; gum. I bought my youngest a bag of chips. Apparently it was an issue that my eldest did what she did and I have to step up to being a dad and be more responsible. Oh and the conversation is only over when I apologize or grovel whichever you would like to call it. I really wish I had the balls to leave as when she’s away for work and I have my kids to myself we have so much fun with zero stress.
Every time I want to leave I chicken out and make up excuses as to why I can’t leave. I wish I could be more of a role model for my kids. Right now my 12 year old will ask me if everything is OK and I lie when saying everything is fine! She sees my misery and then I fake smile.
Please excuse the spelling or grammar as I have a hard time even looking at this post due to my constant failures to stop it happening. Replies to this post might be slow since I have to hide my activity on my cell phone.

The craziest thing is we share so much. He has a depth I have never seen before in anyone else. Which is perfect because I have a depth. We can talk about the deepest shit, and it's totally normal. We share religion. We share music interests. He still dreams. The man still dreams. I have never met someone I have shared so much with. For someone of his age, he is still so young. He has a hunger for life that I just love. He is always going somewhere, and that is usually the beach. 

The best thing is he has no kids. No offense, but it would be awkward if he did. Let's face it, I would only be ten years older or so than his kids. But he doesn't. 

The bottom line is that despite this difference, we resonate. Our spirits are the same. We are the same person. I want so bad to be with him. I can imagine life with him. He knows I like him. And he hasn't run screaming. In fact, he is speaking to me a bit more since he found it. So I'm taking that as a good sign.

I dated this guy for 4 (kind of) months. 

But at that time, he was heartbroken from his last relationship that lasted 10 months. So he was emotionally off/ unavailable which I understand. 

I broke up with him after 1 month relationship with him then he came back 1 week after. Then after 3 months he broke up with me saying that we didn't seem to find each other. He still seemed into his last relationship as he was often talking about his ex, how he went there and there with her. I was distant, so was he.

So for 4 months, I went NO contact. Lived my life fully. Dated. 

He came back, we talked and he asked me to see me.

He told he met some girls but he was fed up with shorts relationships (one night stand) without feeling anything with the girl. He told me he felt empty by having sex with women he didn't love. 
He told me that he first wants to build links with a woman, hang out with her, create memories with her. He says that it's what happen in movie ; the characters (boy and girl) meet, live an adventure and then fall in love.

He told me all of that and I suppose he now want to build those links with me.

We now see each other regularly, text each other everyday, talk a lot. He hugged me once. He often tease me on how boys flirt with me because Im pretty. He often say im beautiful. It's been 1 month...

11705,Relationships,36xn0l,"Hi reddit, 

This one is kind of weird.

My boyfriend and I don't have a normal relationship. It's semi-open, but ONLY to find people to introduce to our sex life together (threesomes, foursomes, that sort of thing.) 

He is big into social media and making friends on the internet, which is something I don't have a problem with until it affects real life. (If we are spending time together and he spends more time on his phone than talking to me, it becomes an issue.)

With that, the people he talks to are mainly semi-attractive women. However, every time a really attractive woman talks to him (he finds them on twitter or tumblr) they are ALWAYS fake people using other people's pictures.

He constantly gives these fake people the benefit of the doubt. I'll tell him that they're probably fake, and he'll say well who knows. You know who knows? I do, because I reverse image search their pictures and they are on multiple sites. The more recent one is one he started talking to on his porn tumblr. He wanted me to start talking to her so we could start something (I guess sexting, or something) and it is a faker using a picture of a 16 year old girl.

This naivety is such a turn off. I don't know what to do really. I've told him that he is too trusting on the internet but it doesn't really phase him.

I obviously can't change him, so I think my only option is to let the distasteful feelings toward him either pass or turn into resentment. If he wants friends on the internet, what harm does that do to me? I'm starting to think I'm just being a bitch, or maybe deep down I'm questioning his motives for seeking out these women.

What should I do? Should I just find a way to get over it? I know how petty this all is, and I'm ashamed that I even feel this way.

Thanks

My husband and I have been in a relationship for eight years, married for one. Two years ago we lost our son, a baby, which is more or less the catalyst for our problems. A year later I was diagnosed with depression which I am struggling with to this day.

Some days are a lot better than others, the death of a friend recently has taken me back and I'm struggling more than usual. But generally I feel as though I can see a light at the end of the tunnel and there are days when things are looking up for me. 

I have noticed, however, that my husband's behavior has been changing. He's been snappy, aggressive, he's begun to complain about minor aches issues frequently and that's simply not how he used to be. At first I brushed this off as him not being able to cope with me but after having talked it over he has eventually that he's simply not coping and feels very overwhelmed with our current situation and that he does believe he's depressed. We've both expressed a feeling of losing our minds, which is a bit terrifying.

He's not good at expressing his feelings so for him to make this giant step is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. So far I've tried to step up a bit, do more around the house, nag less and give him some space, try to involve myself with his hobbies and interests more. I've encouraged him to see a doctor and didn't think he would as this is so out of character but he's agreed to. Now what I'm looking for is more advice really. What more can I do for him?

11713,Relationships,1ljtfg,"When I was 16 my mother took in two teens from an abusive household. First it was the brother. Me and him became close; we still are. A few weeks later, his sister -- my future girlfriend -- moved in. My relationship with her developed quick and excitingly, full of emotion and sexual firsts. My mother didn’t approve; I could eventually see why. This girl is crazy. She is dependent, compulsive, intolerant, and only takes things on either pole. It was either I loved her or I hated her. If she got even the slightest idea that I was upset, she would think I fucking hated her and she would go postal. The first time I tried to end things it didn’t last; my fucking dumbass couldn’t maintain self-control. Sometime later during a fight, she tells me that she tried to kill herself that first night I broke up with her. Our relationship continued on. Throughout Junior and Senior year of highschool my relationship with my mother was destroyed, I lost all of my friends, and I was in a situation that I hated. I tried to end things several other instances. One time she used scissors and slit her wrists. I was never able to carry through with the breakup. Life went on like this. As long as I didn’t do anything to upset her and made sure that I spent time with her, things went decent enough for me to live.

Three years later, we’re together and she mentions something to me. She tells me about her brother’s relationship with his girlfriend. She talks about how his girlfriend has attempted to break-up with him multiple times throughout their long engagement. But somehow, he always finds a way to force her to stay. 

That is when I realized my situation. She is exactly like her brother and our relationship is exactly like theirs. Many times I tried to end it. But that was the past. The pleading, self-harm, and suicide attempts eventually reached a point where it was just easier to stay in a relationship with her than to attempt a breakup. I never really accepted this fact; I sat in denial: “I’m with her because I love her.” I would say to myself. Do I love her? Why? Our relationship wasn’t organic, we didn’t meet like every other couple does, we barely dated. It was puppy love, she will never admit it, but we were 16. Three years later and we have an apartment together. I signed a lease with her that says “I will be with you for the next 12 months”. Now I am trapped. But what’s the difference? Even if I did want to breakup with her I couldn’t. I wouldn’t. But I have to. I have to for her and I have to for me. But I can’t. What if she kills herself? Her brother is my best and only friend. Will he blame me? Why does she love me? Seriously, I haven’t anything to offer her; we don’t share the same hobbies, our personalities clash in many ways. Maybe she hates me but she can’t stand the thought of being alone; she has grown socially and emotionally dependent on me. I don’t know what to do.

When I started the semester I bumped into an acquaintance of mine (the 19F) and we had a pleasant conversation then the next week it turned out she had the same (long) comute to campus as me so we started to travel together and keep each other company.

I quickly found myself enjoying her company to the point of getting up hours before my usual time just so I could travel with her, I felt it was worth it because as well as traveling together we have an hour to just chill before any lectures, just us, the only other people on campus at that time is a few cleaners and such. 

Turns out we have similar things in common, we always make each other smile and we both seem to be throwing complements left right and center to each other. 

I feel as though I would have said something to her by now but, alas, she is seeing somebody already. But she rarely talks about him and when she does she never makes it sound like the best relationship, which makes me think that we get on better than she does with her BF but for all I know that might not be the case.

And while I don't think I was asking for a lot and I don't agree with his decision, I totally respect him for being honest and not continuing even when he wasn't feeling it.

I like spending time with him as a person and I wouldn't be upset if we were just friends. I'm thinking that I wouldn't try for a few weeks at the very least. Maybe 3-4 weeks? But is this something I should even pursue? We didn't break up for any horrible reason and I don't feel any ill will towards him.

I'm pretty sure he's monogamous, just based on how much time we spend together. I love him very much, but not in a really romantic way. I don't get butterflies, can't see kids with him in the future etc. It's been this way for years and we both enjoy it. For the past couple months, though, I've been talking to a girl I met online. She's gorgeous, smart, mature and she can cook. I get all the things from her that I want in a partner. When we started talking it was almost like instant love or something. I don't go a day without hearing her voice. Recently, we began hanging out in real life. I'm cool with just chilling and talking but she wants something physical. Cool, right? No. She wants to began on the next level of us but with the stipulation that I end it with my best friend, despite there being nothing to end but random, casual hooking up. I'm struggling with the choice because I love him, will always, even if we never bone again and I'm not comfortable cutting people out of my life for any reason other than my own wanting to. But...I really like Her. She gives me all that affection that I don't get from my best friend. We sleep together but that's it. I find it strange to even kiss him so we don't kiss. I daydream about kissing her, on the other hand. I'm really not trying to lose either of them. I've been through tough shit with my best friend and if she was asking that I just stop sleeping with him, it'd be done in a second. We've gone platonic before in the past for each other's relationships. She wants him gone, period.

 I do like her and to me sex is not that important. I'm good just getting to know her but she say's she's got deep feelings for me, that she wants to be with me, take it to a next level.  I'm cool with this but I feel caught in the middle. She say's I've led her on emotionally and that I now have to shit or vacate the pot in regards to us. That I owe her myself, I guess because of the bond I helped build up. Outside this, she's the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. I am sick of seeing her cry. I'm sick of being close to her but feeling tension. Sometimes, she asks me dozens of questions about him. Demands the answers and shuts down when it gets too real for her. I'm tired of it because I want her to be happy but she kinda knew the deal upfront. I can't let my best bro just fall to the wayside at her request. How can I explain this to her? I haven't slept with Him, either since I started seeing her in person but I admit when we were phone only I did a couple times. Told her, it's not good enough.

 He's suggesting that I just lie and tell her pretty things and still we remain best buds. I don't wanna start on a bad, note with her so that's not an option. Reddit, what do?

I am currently studying abroad for a semester in Spain and  I will be back home this January. We have been together for six years, where we grew into adults together. We were 17 when we started dating.  We have been through so much, so many happy and bad times.  We always managed to make up and love each other more each time.  Now he wants nothing to do with me. 

He broke up with me on Saturday, after I had taken a day trip to a city on a mountain.  I told him before I left I was going on a day trip, that I would text him when I got home, and that I loved him.  I spent most of my day walking through the historical city, and when it came time for lunch I searched for a restaurant with wifi. The girls I went with (I only go on trips with other girls because I want to make him feel secure) settled on a a spot. Unfortunately it didn't have wifi. For dinner, the place we had gone to did have wifi and I immediately texted him. But I got the messages he sent me while I was out, that he wanted to break up. I texted him back immediately as he had sent those messages hours ago.  He said it was over that it was the distance and the fact that I didn't text him all day made him realize he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with me.

When i got home I texted him some more, asking him to reconsider and to at least talk to me on Skype. He declined, telling me to move on.  I was determined to save what we had, especially since I am so close to coming home, January is coming up quickly.  He ignored all my messages. He was doing no contact, but I foolishly broke his no contact rule. So I emailed him today. Asking him if we had any chance to reconcile, even if it meant waiting until I got back. He said no, that he was moving on and I should do the same. He said I should stop texting him, calling him, or even emailing him. I had been blocked and he was warning me.  I sent him a long sappy email asking him to reconsider.  But its clear he's already made up his mind.  I didn't cheat, I didn't do any of the things I knew would bug him, and I didn't even make any guy friends. I just wanted to make him happy. We used to text daily, I used to tell him I loved him daily and to have a good day.   

I feel like I've hit rock bottom.  I've been blocked on social media and on his phone. The pain is still very fresh. He blames me, saying its my fault this relationship ended for leaving.  But its not permanent and I'd be coming back.  We were very happy together and our relationship was great before I left, we were talking about moving in together, having kids, and getting married. He knew studying in Spain was a big dream of mine, I had been talking about it since high school.  I haven't been attending class even though I'm struggling with my courses in Spanish, I can't get out of bed, and I just cry all day.  There's a 9 hour time difference from here to California, so when I need my friends most they're usually asleep or busy.  

He was my first boyfriend and my first love.  I know people say that there are more men out there and there will be one that actually wants to be in a relationship with me.  But I only want him.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend of six years blames me for the end of the relationship for doing study abroad for five months. He's erased me from his life and I can't get out of bed.

11721,Dating,2lwdmy,"So, I met a girl online about a month ago and we got on pretty well. We didn't talk a huge amount online, but I went to see her two weekends ago and had an excellent first date, and we got on really well. Last weekend she came down to visit me, and it continued to go very well. Both times, there was staying over and leaving the next day.

Not going through all the fine details, but due to our respective situations, we don't have a huge amount of free time for the next few months, so for the time being, it's looking like we can meet up every other weekend. The next time we're both free will be three weekends' time.

The problem is; I'm not a great texter. And it seems, neither is she. Our texts have just involved making arrangements and basic chit chat, but like, once a day if that. When we're face to face, we get on like a house on fire, and she seems really keen to meet me again, and I really want to see her again. It's hard to explain, but it just works way better in person than over texts right now.

My big concern is how we're going to keep this going if we don't have much time to meet face to face and we're not prolific texters. As of mid/early next year, I'll have all the time in the world to see her, but right now I'm stranded about an hour away (and take it from me, finding the time is difficult for both of us for now).

Can anyone advise how to keep this going without just drifting apart? I've considered phone calls, but I'm thinking more along the lines of what to do over text, making plans, what to say, etc. I've only been single since the end of June, but I started dating pretty early and I haven't connected with someone like this for a while. It's probably too early to be thinking about this, but long term prospects are really good, it's just that our circumstances are kinda awkward right now. I understand if it may seem like an unlikely situation to keep going, but I'm curious for your thoughts and guidance on what I should do, just on the off chance!

11722,Relationships,21qazz,"Throwaway because bf and his friends are all redditors. 


My SO and I have been together for 4 and a half years. We got together just as I was starting university, and he decided to give it a go as well. He nearly did a full year before deciding it wasn't for him. That was quite hard for me as I was really excited for us to be studying together and also knowing that we were both on similar paths, but he wasn't happy to I was supportive of his decision. He went on to do a number of different jobs, mainly manual/trades type work, but he was never really satisfied.


About a year ago he decided to move away to work offshore, although we were going to stay together. It was a really tumultuous time in our relationship, and we actually split up for a while, but ultimately realised that we did want to be together and would make it work. Finding a job offshore was hard for him, but he eventually got one and it was well paid and had great prospects, so it was looking really great for him, and for our future. However, 3 weeks into his first hitch he injured himself really badly and had to leave his job. He had also decided that offshore wasn't for him because being away from myself, his family and friends for 4 weeks at a time wasn't a sacrifice he was willing to make.


We discussed options and he decided to go back to uni, a decision I was really happy about. I am in my fifth year at the same uni, and for once it was looking like our worlds were going to collide in a really good way. At the time, I told him that I wanted him to think hard about this decision because I really didn't want to go through the starting over thing again, and he promised this was his future and he was happy with it. However, 4 weeks in and he is saying that he made a mistake and he wants to quit uni. He says it's not what he expected, he isn't 'cut out' for it etc. etc. 


I am devastated. I am torn between supporting him in his decisions, but also the effect they have on me. I am 'going places' (for want of a better term), and he doesn't seem to want to be. I don't need or want a really successful SO, but I know that at some point soon I will have options to move overseas and work or study, and with his lack of qualifications he will likely not be able to come. I don't want to have to make the decision between advancing my career and being with him. I want both!


I am also finding this really unsettling. One minute he is doing one thing, the next he wants to do something else. Meanwhile, I have had the same study and career trajectory since day one. This year is academically very tough for me and the extra stress of him discussing quitting already, is taking its toll on my emotionally.


Basically, I want some advice on how to deal with this. Should I let him just do whatever? Or should I make it clear that I want him to stay? I want to be supportive but I don't want to enable him to keep quitting everything he starts.

11723,Breakups,1sxcbg,"We were married for 5 years before she decided I'm not what she wants (lack of communication on my part being the main factor) and called for a divorce. I didn't fight her decision, I guess partly because I was not happy in the relationship either. Where we are living now, we need to be separated for 1 year before we can get divorced, and that was the plan.  
  
It wasn't a bad breakup, in fact we still see each other regularly, but she insisted that we are not dating and are only hanging out as regular friends, though she admits she also finds it weird that we still get along well.  
  
And then she told me she's changed her mind about going through with the divorce, but still wants to stay separated until she either decides she wants to get back together, or finds someone else. We both agreed that we'd both try to meet other people and if either one of us finds someone, we'd still get divorced.  
  
I didn't really know what to think about that, but I told her I was fine with it if that's what she wants. Pretty much all the close friends that I've told that to has used the same words to describe what she is doing as selfish and that she's using me as a backup plan.  

Meanwhile I've realised how I was unable to cope with being alone again and started to feel depressed. Being an introvert and lacking social skills has only made it harder for me to meet new people. I think part of me thinks that I still have to be faithful to her and unable to move on until she makes the move to truly end our relationship/marriage. Which makes me feel trapped in this situation where I can't do anything.  

I've told her about me feeling depressed, and also about what she's doing is not fair to me and that she must decide on the divorce in March next year, which would be 1 year since we separated. It took a while before she admitted/realised that she was being selfish and was actually treating me as her backup plan. And she agreed that she would decide in March. But when I asked her to start thinking about our relationship and what she wants to help her decide, she refused and said she'd just decide on the day itself.  

Also she has met a guy but he lives in a different state, so its mostly a long distance relationship although she has flown to visit him before. She told me a few months after it started, and that she can't decide between the 2 of us. I find myself wishing she decide soon and pick him, and that would help me move on.  
  
I don't know how I should be feeling about all this. But I do know that when we hang out, I feel OK, better than I would be feeling being alone at home. She's still the main form of social interaction that I have now. Most of my friends are already married or have children and are too busy with their lives. But somehow I feel like I might be doing myself more harm in the long run by spending time with her as regular friends.

11726,Breakups,2jcbfh,"I have been browsing Reddit for a while now and this is my first time posting. I don't know where to start.


It's been 1 year and 3 months since things ended and not one day goes by where I don't regret the decision I made. I took someone who would have done anything for me and broke her heart. 

We have had our history of problems... but she was my first girlfriend and I was her first boyfriend. There were bound to be slip ups. By far I have had more slip ups, some she will never know about. 

It's crazy how this person, who I met at the young age of 14, who I have shared so much with and created so many memories with is now no longer in my life. I wanted to marry her, I wanted everything to be with her. A few bad decisions in a transition period of my life made me think that space or a break-up was necessary to find out my direction in life.


We went to different colleges, I went away (although only 4 hours) neither of us had/could afford a car, so distance put a huge strain our relationship... we would see each other on holidays, text and call everyday, and once in a while we would visit each other at school. 

The distance also made her a bit doubtful of me... although I gave her good reason. I tended to get a lot of attention from many girls and at times, I would welcome it, encourage it. I guess for some reason, being with one girl for so long created some sort of doubt in my mind about my status or how attractive I was or something? I don't know how to explain it... All I know is I felt satisfaction and confidence when I found out a girl was interested in me. And as mentioned before I have slipped up a few times.


However, despite all of the issues we made it through college. She graduated a year before me so by now she was getting ready to enter Law school where as I had no idea where I was going or where I would end up. I come from a very modest (poor) family, when I returned home I was reminded of how poor and how much nothing we had. I didn't feel it while I was in school, I was fortunate enough to go to college with a full scholarship, so for a while I felt like a king.


I felt a huge amount of pressure to find a job and figure things out for my family, being the eldest of five and first generation, that pressure is somewhat large... I had to ensure my siblings do well, and are knowledgeable about their direction. I wanted to go to medical school but I kept weighing the consequences it would have on my relationship. I love this girl no doubt about it, but I felt like I couldn't make clear decisions because I kept weighing her into the equation, so I thought naturally, a break. 


After I brought it up with her, she hated the idea, and insisted I wanted it purely to meet and see other people. I did not care about any of that... I just wanted to figure things out and be somebody she could be proud to introduce to her family some day.


She always put great pressure on me, we went on seven years and I never met any of her family. Although I introduced her to my parents and siblings. She insisted that it was because it was taboo, but part of me felt she was always unsure, and didn't want to have a bad image if it didn't work out. 


My goal for this break was to find a job, figure out my life plan, and become someone she was proud of. 


When I brought it up with her, she was devastated, she said either we work things out or break up. Being the stubborn asshole I am... and I am just bad at arguing in general, I tend to become very quiet and introverted during fights, I don't know what to say often. I blurted, I guess we are broken up... and left. 


She went on to start law school, and I tried studying... I would keep in touch see how she was... I knew I had every intention of getting back with her, and I knew it would work out if I just tried and apologized... but I was being stubborn.


I guess naturally I shouldve realized transitioning into law school was the perfect time for her to have a break up, and the worst for me since I had no job and no solid plan. She is gorgeous so naturally she got a lot of attention from guys, I don't blame her I guess for giving one a chance. 


I realized, that there was nothing I wanted more than to have her in my life. I realized that I love her, and that love comes first, and should be a huge part of whatever life decision I was making. Taking time away from each other to realize this was a huge mistake, as it just pushed her away and hurt her.


I become immediately depressed and i would get constant flashbacks to every single moment we spent together. Seven years is a long time, it was about to be 8 years. I cried myself to sleep many nights thinking, realizing what I gave up, what I lost. Eventually I decided, I would do everything I can to get a shot with her. Somehow in my mind that meant getting into her law school. So just like that, over night I went from medicine to law, took the LSAT applied, got a job at a law firm and ultimately got into many law schools, with scholarships... However, I decided not to go. (good thing because she ended up transferring to another school anyway)


This is after about 4 or five months of no contact at all (she blocked me on all forms of communication). 


I've tried dating, dating websites, going out whatever... Nothing gets her out of my mind, I still love her a lot and I would do anything just to have a shot with her. I would never hurt her again, never be late for a meeting, never argue, and just correct all my flaws that are so apparent now in hind sight.

I let go an Ivy educated, soon to be attorney, who is gorgeous, smart, strong, and kind. And I cant get over it.


What do I do? I still have some bleak hope in my mind that sometime, years from now it could work out... I still work at a law firm, and I am studying for the MCAT at night. The idea of medical school scares me because it would mean being away... it would mean there is no chance for things to work out.


Anyone on here ever got back with an ex after many years? I hate this feeling... I care about her so much, I think about her every morning, I can't even give girls an honest shot because she is such an ideal in my mind that I constantly compare people to her. I get sad, I always see couples and it bothers me because it flashes me back to what I had. 


I don't know what I am looking for posting this, obviously the posting is very vague, sporadic, and may not make sense in a lot of places. But I guess anything will help. People of Reddit, your knowledge and experience is my counsel.

He's studying internationally and has a sports scholarship at his college, where he resides. His studies and especially sports involvement have him more involved in his own interests and lifestyle than in the relationship. We just had a big fight and I hung up on him and stated we were finished, blinded by sheer frustration and anger. I love him to bits but it just feels like he lets his own interests create distance between us. He admits this too, so it's not some theory I have. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation or can offer some advice as to what to do next? I'm a romantic at heart and can't see myself with anyone else, but the way the relationship is going now makes me feel physically sick.

I feel he doesn't give me enough time and that it's all just so one-sided. He's not as attentive as he used to be. It makes me feel lonely and unappreciated. I'm in the process of a visa application to visit him for 12 months so I don't know what to do now - I've already paid for half of it. As you can probably tell, it's a terrible situation. I'm losing sleep and I've been taking medication to deal with my anxiety from these recent events.

HE SAYS: His lifestyle choices are everything to him and that he loves me dearly but still feels guilty about placing me second to everything he does, and he's unwilling to compromise.

I've been doing the regular post-break up self healing, like keeping myself busy at all times, reducing contact with my ex etc. The day after we broke up finally, my ex was hiking for a whole week in some remote area and he didn't have phone signal so we didn't really text much at all. I was back at university the following day so I've been kept busy. 

I've joined societies, been going to the gym, been on socials, been out with my girlfriends clubbing, been around people 24/7 for the first two weeks and it really helped with the break up.

The urge has been getting pretty overwhelming lately so I'm posting here instead which I hope will be more productive!

I was in a relationship with my now ex-gf for over 5 years. The last 6-7 months have been long distance. I am in New Zealand and my ex lives in Australia. 

This was my first relationship and I'm extremely fortunate to have been with someone as amazing as this girl. Here's a bit of backstory:

We both met studying music. I was a very shy, solitary person and she was very drawn to me for some reason. She was actually with someone else at the time she developed a crush on me, and pursued me very soon after he had broken up with her. I think alot of problems in her previous relationship, which lasted 9 months, had to do with her developing feelings for me. I didn't realise much of this until awhile into the relationship. This also caused alot of issues and insecurities within our relationship when I found out this information.

She asked me to play for a performance at music school (during her previous relationship) and soon after this was texting me regularly. We developed a friendship which very soon turned into a relationship. I feel like she kind of pushed us into that territory at first, I was very hesitant about getting into a relationship, but once it happened I fell in love very quickly. It was such a nice experience falling in love for the first time and having someone care about you so much. I'm the type of person that really struggles to make and sustain friendships, so this was a very new thing for me.

Skipping forward a bit, we moved in together after a couple of years, after finishing our studies. We got a cat and were pretty happy together. There were a few shaky moments in the relationship, mainly due to my lack of communication, not putting enough effort into the relationship and social anxiety issues etc. But we tried really hard to work through these problems through counseling and growing as people together. 

Our living situation got expensive after awhile so last year we moved in with her parents. This got a little stressful at times due to lack of space and being far from the city, but we managed through it. She then had the idea to move to Australia to earn more money and for a fresh change. Also, she had major issues with her boss at the two cafes she worked at, she would often find herself very overworked and underpaid. We were supposed to move over together, but I decided to stay because I had been getting musical opportunities - tours, gigs etc. We didn't even really consider not staying in a relationshipdue to long distance because we were so commited to each other. 

So that brings us to recent times. The distance has been hard on us, but I've never felt that the relationship was in jeopardy at any time. She had been staying with family over there and was working full time at a cafe, while also doing a lot of babysitting for her family. During this time we didn't actually keep in touch that often because she had so little time to herself. Once again space was an issue for her and she would mostly vent/complain about various issues when we did talk together.

A few months later she moved into her sister's place and once again found herself in a situation where she wasn't getting along with her boss at the cafe and was getting quite stressed and depressed, overworked and underpaid, not really pursuing anything musical.

This brings us to more current events. I've recently been feeling guilty about being quite happy on my own. I am working mostly as a musician and writing lots of music, playing with lots of people, touring and going to see live music. I'm not doing the best financially but I'm really enjoying the way my life is going, I feel really artistically fulfilled and inspired at the moment. When we were together I didn't feel the same kind of freedom and it got to me at times. In saying that though I felt really great not being dependent on her and being able to be my own person, but still being really in love with her. The plan was for me to move over near the end of the year when my schedule was clear and I could set up some kind of situation with her, live happily ever after etc.

One of the major issues in our relationship was a large amount of tension when it came to making music together, we would often fight when we would rehearse for gigs we did together. She has a lot of self-esteem issues when it comes to music and would often feel like I was attacking her or acting like I was superior when I really didn't feel that way at all, although I am more than willing to accept that I could have come across that way in hindsight. She also had issues playing with people that weren't me and had to really be pushed to do this. 

So, I got to see her twice in recent times. We met up in Sydney for 2 days for an audition I had (which was unsuccessful), we thought it would be good to meet up because it was my birthday as well. The circumstances were quite stressful for me but I was very happy to get to be with her for a few days, and the feeling was mutual with her. I then visited her a few weeks later for about 2 weeks. My ex was unable to get time off work while I was there, so most of my time was spent exploring the city and doing date-like things on my own and then spending the evening with my gf who was really too tired to do anything. This really sucked to be honest. I was able to hang out with her for 3 full days though over the weekend, which was really nice. 

The suggestion to take a 'break' came up on the third or fourth night I was there. There had been a bit of tension on the second day where I visited her as she was closing up at work and a bit of silent treatment happened from both sides because I was trying to help her shut but felt she was acting cold to me, but was just stressed and tired. We did reconcile by the next day, but I may have triggered something in her because we talked the next night about taking a 'break'. She said she was confused and felt very happy but very sad at the same time. 

She said that she wasn't sure what she was doing with her life and wanted to quit her job and spend more time doing music. After talking through this stuff she mentioned that she also wanted to not be so dependent on me. She felt like the majority of the time she had moved she was just waiting for me to move over so she could start her life properly over there. She was not really living for herself, and she also mentioned that she felt really comfortable in our relationship and that this was not necessarily a good thing, I also had a strong vibe that she had become attracted to other guys (workmates) while being over there from the way she answered some of my questions.

I think she's feeling kind of trapped and is going through a depression. I was about as understanding as I could be, and after talking this through we did have a few great times while together, and had a level of intimacy that was missing from the relationship for awhile. It was a really strange time being so happy together but having a cloud of ambiguous finality over everything. Things ended on really happy terms and we ended up deciding to not be so dependent on each other and try and live seperate lives for awhile.

I have now been back home for a little less than two weeks. The first day I was back, I texted her saying I was home safe (on request). She sent back a text saying some small stuff about finishing work and going out to kick boxing. She then said I will try to not talk to you so much but in the nicest way possible if possible??!!. Then a few hours later she texted back saying sorry to break the silence and mentioned a few items I had left behind. Her next text said Good luck for the gigs this week and also it doesn't mean I definitely won't text you but am trying to be a strong, independent woman, comfortable in my own skin in most situations. I'm getting there, day one!

I felt a sense of relief and comfort because she also sent me texts saying things like we'll be OK, you are still so important to me etc. That was about 12 days ago now and the no contact has been killing me inside. I've been reading up about breaks and how the majority of them never end well, over the past few days I've detached myself to the point of realising this is basically a break-up and that I need to move on with my life. The first week was easier to handle because I was insanely busy, but this week has been difficult and my mind is racing with all sorts of silly thoughts. I've begun assuming the worst and keep doing things like checking my facebook and e-mails incessantly in case she has contacted me. I deleted her from my facebook recently for this reason.

I know I shouldn't contact her at all, but doing this cold turkey is really hard. I've contacted her in some way almost everyday for the past 5 years, so I guess it's like overcoming an addiction or something.

I've gone through an emotional rollercoaster of anger, sadness and confusion and have kind of decided a break is just kind of a cowardly way to break up, I'm not sure about having no communication in the nicest way possible. It just doesn't work like that. So I'm just going to keep moving forward and join a gym, try to make new friends and be happy. The thing that I would not be able to handle is if she became involved with someone else. The thought makes me feel physically ill. I did mention this to her and basically said it would destroy me. This is one of my major insecurities in our relationship based on how she jumped straight from another relationship into our one. She has also not had much space in between any of her relationships (I think she's had 6-7 boyfriends) so I think she shouldn't really jump into anything, of course I would say that though!

I know it's a bit unfair of me to expect that of her though, which is kind of why I'm just expecting the worst and trying not to hope we'll get back together or anything like that anymore, I deserve better than to be strung along waiting for her to figure things out, I need to move on. Maybe there is someone better for her, and for me... Her happiness is very important to me and I hope someday in the future I'll be able to look back proudly on how I handled this. 

I don't really have a specific question, just wanted to share my story and vent. Also I'd really like some feedback on whether I've completely missed the mark with the way I'm handling this or something, I feel like maybe I should have been a bit firmer with setting terms to a break, like how long there would be no contact for, but, hell, I just don't know what's going on to be honest, I feel really lost. 

Sorry for this essay of a post and thanks so much for reading!

I've decided to just realise this is the end of our relationship.

11735,Relationships,2ifc94,"I met my current boyfriend about 2 months ago and we've been exclusive for a little over a month. I knew before I started dating him that he had been with a girl a few years ago and he took their break-up very hard. I knew this because he has been a friend of my best friend for about 4 years; and my best friend had told me that they had broke up because the girl had wanted to see other people since she was moving away to a new college.  This had happened about 2 years ago, and since then my boyfriend had been dating/sleeping around, but hadn't really been exclusive with again anyone until me. 

We've been getting along really well, have a lot of fun together, same interests, etc. Last weekend when we were together we had been drinking (him a lot more than me) and he started to talk about his ex. He pretty much explained to me that everything he had been doing in his life for the past few years since the break-up (all of his jobs, school accomplishments, etc) he felt like he was doing them for his ex. The thing is, he hasn't even had any contact with his ex for over a year and a half, but he still felt/feels(?) that he has to make her happy and proud. He also told me that he was actually the one that told his girlfriend at the time to leave him, because he didn't want to tie her down. He also said to me that he's ashamed of this, and hates it; and that it's the reason that he 'can't say those three words' (I told him I didn't expect that of him anyways, as we've only known each other for a couple months).

I'll admit, I already knew he still had feelings for her before this; it's painfully obvious. He hates talking about her and gets extremely emotional whenever she is brought up. I guess my problem is that I really don't know where to go from here. I'm starting to have some strong feelings for this man, but I'm also scared of that at the same time. I don't know if I'll ever be able to live up to his first love (not that I feel I need to); or if it's even worth trying with this. I feel like he wants to let go of her but he can't for some reason (could be completely wrong about his though), but I'm also not out to fix or try and force him to do anything. I just feel like this may be be the hardest obstacle in this relationship, and I don't know if he will be able to get over her.

But not caring to the same extent, and after being called selfish during our break, I can't justify wasting the same kind of time and effort on him I did before.

11738,Infidelity,1vizdk,"Well, to start us off I work for a retail company and I am part of a team that goes to open new stores.

Before I left to do the first store opening, my fiance had been distant, lethargic, and we had been fighting a lot. Honestly, I wasn't happy and starting to regret my decision to move in together.

So nothing really big happened at the first one. I made new friends and it was great. One of the team members, we'll call him Bruce, I got along with really well. He was super nerdy like me, he was funny, outgoing, and just overall I enjoyed his company.

After my time was up at the store i went back home for about a month before the next opening. My fiance was still the same way and nothing had changed. I was starting to get upset by this. We fought more and then I left for the next opening.

This opening is where everything happened. I started hanging out with my new friends more and more. i started hanging out with Bruce way more often and one night he stayed the night with me in my hotel room. Then one night turned into several nights and cheating happened.

I was so happy, but since it all happened at the end of the opening, I never found out what Bruce really wanted from me. Did he want me to break up with my fiance? Did he just want me for company? I never received that closure so now I feel like I have no idea what I want to do.

The worst part of all of this is when I came home, I was expecting my fiance to be the same. I was just going to break it off then, and tell him everything. He wasn't the same. He was suddenly super clingy and affectionate. This blew me right out of the water. So he still doesn't know.

I've hung out with Bruce a couple times since this last opening, (no cheating has happened on these) but we never really talk about what we wanted from the whole thing, and talking about my fiance to him makes me uncomfortable. Is it wrong to feel like we need to have this conversation? Am I just making up a fake future relationship?

I've tried breaking up with my fiance without telling him, and he threatened suicide. So I know the truth is coming out eventually. I'm still having second thoughts on the wedding and I'm starting to think of my future without him.

11740,Relationships,2i9gfc,"Hi, /r/relationships! As an introductory post to this subreddit, I'd like to ask for some help with what I refer to as my non-problem problem. It's sort of a typical I like this boy but X is making things confusing with a few of its own road bumps, so bear with me for a moment...

So a little about me. I'm in my third year of college, and last February I embarked on a post-breakup sexual walkabout of sorts and enjoyed all the freedom I missed during my previous unhealthy relationship. I had no intentions to settle down with anyone for the foreseeable future and truly enjoyed every part of being single. I'm very good at keeping feelings at bay while I'm casually sleeping with someone. I don't talk to them outside of seeing them, and I never spend the night with these guys. Generally, I only sleep with each guy fewer than five or six times before finding someone else. It's a system that works for me and I held to it pretty well.

Cut to almost three months after my breakup in late April. My school throws a huge party where everyone gets drunk and dances and has a great time, and that's more or less what happened the me at the onset of the night. Something worth noting is that I had met a guy (Let's call him M) the day before at my on-campus job, and there had been some inexplicable spark. Very attractive, and despite our tiny interaction, I also gravitated towards his personality. I can't explain it, /r/relationships, he just seemed like a great guy. Anyways, drunk me decides on the night of this big party that my mission is to find him and hook up with him. It didn't take long to find him, and dancing lead to kissing, kissing lead to stepping outside and exchanging numbers and chatting for a bit. He's a year above me and is as charming and handsome as I had thought the day before. At about 2:00AM, we head back to his room for the best sex I had ever had. Having an orgasm is rare for me, and this guy didn't even break a sweat making it happen. At 4:00AM, despite my long-standing policies, he invites me to stay over and I fall asleep at his place. I still consider it the most successful social night of college so far, 100% A+.

Wake up the next morning and everything is perfectly fine. We get breakfast and part ways. I'm not sure if I'll see him again or in what capacity, but I'm still glowing from my great night. I don't hear from him for the rest of Sunday, but on Monday he asks me to dinner. That dinner date happens later in the week and goes very well. Dating men I casually sleep with is off-limits, but I'm fine doing this for some reason. Because it was late April, however, finals were approaching and the school year was winding down. He and I spent three or four nights a week together until the end of the year. We also hung out a few more times during the days. Everything went really, really well.

The night before he flies away for the summer, he spends the night at my place since his room is all packed up. He comes over after midnight, and we hang out and have sex until 4:00AM. His flight's at 6:00. Naturally, the question of how to handle our relationship over the summer comes up. He beats me to the punch in bringing it up, and says that he doesn't want a relationship since he had left a two-year open relationship only a few months before. He also didn't want to be an emotional support system for me, even though we had had conversations up until that night that were somewhat involved and emotional on both ends. Although I understood and agreed that the timing for a long-distance summer thing didn't seem worth it, I was somewhat disappointed in hearing him vocalize these things. Part of me wanted a sonnet about how he'd want years and year for me or something, I dunno. These feelings are so out of character for me. So he left for home and I packed up and left a few days later for home as well.

I didn't know what to expect from him over the summer. I thought we'd maybe touch base every 3-4 weeks based on how he'd ended things on that last night, but I got a simple text asking how my time home had been not long after we had both gotten home. From there, we texted anywhere from 1-3 times a week, sometimes a little less. I casually saw some people over the summer, remaining excited to get back to school to see him instead.

Summer drags on, but eventually I start the three-day drive back. When I'm a day out, he and I are texting a little and he offers me his room for a few nights until the dorms reopen. I enthusiastically accept. The first night I'm there, he reveals that he hasn't slept with anyone over the summer (which wasn't explicitly for my benefit, but because sex is a very meaningful and connective thing to him). Seeing him again is really great and he's much more mentally affectionate than I expected. After I arrived, what followed were four or five really great days in which we're reunited and spending some time together each day and doing our own stuff for a few hours too. Overall, a good time. His housemates, who I'm friends with, see and understand what's going on between M and I.

School starts again. Because M is now a senior, he is undergoing my school's rigorous, year-long thesis that students must complete to graduate. It's this whole stressful ordeal that involves finding a topic and writing about it at length, so he's stressed. Very stressed. I try to be noninvasive and respect his no-emotional-support rule since I don't want to do anything that would strain or cause him to regret part of his senior year. All the same, when we do spend time together maybe 1-3 times per week, we have very good conversations about his family and our lives, and the sex continues to be awesome.

His ex-girlfriend is worth mentioning. She was a year older than him and very beautiful, but whom a lot of people who aren't M didn't like. One guy explained that [this girl] talked to me for months and hit on me, and never once mentioned that she had a boyfriend. When I hear from other people, it sounded like the open stipulations of the relationship had been abused and some infidelity of some kind had happened. I don't know for sure, I don't feel like it's my business to ask M. Anyways, she came up during a too-drunk conversation he and I had one night when we were sitting on his porch. She had hung out with him that day, and he rambled for a few minutes about that, saying that he didn't know why he was bringing it up to me but maybe that explained something (???). I said that it's fine to acknowledge that your ex of two years was a big part of your life, but I asked if he still had feelings for her. He thought for a moment and said no, he did not. FWIW, he and I haven't said the words I like you to each other at this point, but I had reasonably assumed that was the case based on his treatment of me and the nice things he said to me. This conversation put me in a salty mood. I went to bed that night way too drunk to go home (even though I did NOT want to sleep there), and too drunk to remember the conversation very well. I told myself that if I remember anything in the morning, it's that I felt bad about what had happened that night.

That sort of blew over and he texted me a few days later apologizing. I decide to take a few big steps back. I'm no longer going to initiate contact and I'm no longer going to sleep over. I felt like I had feelings for someone who was in no position to reciprocate and that I had made big miscalculations. We hung out again not long after that, and my whole plan went to shit because we had a really nice night and he stayed over. Okay, way to go, Self. Back on track definitely having feelings for this guy.

Then, a few nights ago, he invites me over saying he's upset. I go to his house, he rants for a long time about how people suck (he had a bad experience with his friends that night). I listened to him, and we both go kind of emotionally worked up which lead to some great sex. We're cuddling and sitting in silence afterwards. Unprompted, he says It's crazy to think that a lot of humanity will never experience that kind of closeness and connection. Um, wow okay. I was taken off guard, but it was a very nice thing to say and I agreed as much as I could. He's a little more spiritual than I am in matters like that.

So things seem good. I'm back at his house a few days later and see a picture of his ex on his wall. This gets me back into my weird he still loves her and obviously they're getting married what the fuck am I doing here I should go headspace, and it got me thinking that it's dumb to stress about this.

So /r/relationships, here's what I go in light of all of this:
*We've spent enough time together and shared some decently connected moments that I think we aren't simply hooking up. 

*I have no desire to sleep with anyone else right now. He could easily sleep with any girl, but he isn't doing that either. I'd certainly consider a relationship with him, but I don't think he has the time for that right now considering the hugely stressful thesis and senior year's social stuff.

*I don't think I have any business asking what's going on, because things are going fine. I worry it would be sort of awkward, wherein I either get told that he's not down with feelings, or that he has them--and now that we've acknowledged mutual feelings, what do we do with them?

*The end of the first quarter is rolling around. As time ticks by, he'll become more reluctant to start a relationship. If I continue waiting and putting in effort to push him in the relationship direction, I'll develop more feelings that might go to waste if the window closes and second semester happens without any development.

I need a little guidance with this conversation. Please help me. This is such a cyclical and dumb thing to stress about.

I feel like I desire her a lot and she doesn't really desire me just accepts me.

For example, I like to compliment her everyday and tell her romantic things. Not in a pathetic way, but because I do feel this way. She on the other hand could go a couple days without talking to me, and doesn't seem to get jealous. Which I agree is a good trait but also it makes me question if she does have strong feelings for me.

Another thing that's been bothering me is her guy friends. Guys approach women all the time, and I'm not saying always, but USUALLY its because they're interested in her. I don't really like her giving attention to other guys that have this undertone. I also feel this way because I have no motivation to pursue relationships with girls and I guess I expect for her to feel the same way. What's wrong with me? Is it ok for me to have no girl friends and for her to have guy friends??? It's come to the point that just the fact of her talking to another guy will make me feel like shit. I know she has been talking to her friend and they want to meet up when they have a chance and it just fucks up my day.

I just want to be with her all the time and I understand this is bad. I need to take control over the relationship again or else I will just push her away. I also don't want to just give her space and be dying inside of wanting to see her, I want to FEEL ok with it. I want to feel bullet proof when she sees another guy, and be untouchable when were apart and be desired by her.

11746,Relationships,1k33h3,"I am an Iranian citizen who has been living in [Republic of Georgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country) for the past year. On my first days of of coming to this country I met this American boy and we just clicked, we were merely room mates first, things just went on from there. Two months ago he insisted that he wants to get married and although I had explained to him several times that this is not how we do it (In Iran people get to know each other and go through dating for 3-5 years, then get engaged and stay engaged for another 3-4 other years and then they get married) but he was persistent about it, claiming that this way 'he gets to keep me'! So we got married.

He had previously shown great interest in visiting Iran and meeting my whole family, saying that since he doesn't have much of a family and had no strong family ties with his family when he did have one, now he wants to enjoy that with my family, since my family 'is his family now'.. So right after we got married, he said he wants to get the procedure done to get him a visa into Iran. Now bear in mind that because of Iran and US very bad relationship, Iran does not normally give out visas to American citizens. So this special circumstance (him being married to an Iranian citizen) would give him the opportunity of a one month visa for starters.

Now this country that we currently reside in, we both hate it. And me being an Iranian citizen, we do not have that many options as to where we can both live, our options are basically limited to USA, Iran (for an unknown period, since its not 100% sure that they will renew his visa and him getting Iranian citizenship is not easy) We had never had plans to stay here forever. Him getting a visa into Iran required some steps and procedures and is somewhat time consuming, but we're going through that anyway. 

About a week ago he tells me that if he cannot get a visa he's gonna have to leave, because he cannot take this place anymore and we are both miserable about living here and my visa process into US is gonna take time. Saying that he doesn't want to split but he's afraid that our governments are not gonna let us stay together! Now me getting a US visa is quite possible and easy though. He says he's started the process but I see no proof of that and honestly I doubt that he's done it. Now I am not so crazy about living in the States, I really just want to be with him, anywhere.. But this right now does not seem to be mutual. 

The relationship is great. We enjoy each other immensely. I could easily swear that he genuinely loves me.. But now with all this I am afraid that he only married me to get a visa into Iran and is gonna leave me there.

I've confronted him about, his reply you know I like looking at pictures and you swear we never do it we just did it the other day.

So, right now my ex-boyfriend and I aren't well.. together hence the ex part. Let me give a bit of a background. We've known each other for almost 3 years now. We met online on a language exchange site and we started dating last year when he came to visit me for the first time so we have been together for 1 year officially though. 


On thanksgiving day he broke up with me. Now, the reasons for that are entirely my fault. We've had a rocky relationship. We have great chemistry and all but it's me the main problem. I've gone through a very strong trauma with my dad whom is an alcoholic and i won't go into details but it has affected me greatly over the years. So.. in the culture of my ex, it's pretty normal to drink. Not that it isn't in other places, but THIS is a cultural thing. Anyway, at first i didn't mind but as we started getting closer and closer i started worrying. I panic. I can't handle the thought of him drinking or getting drunk. He isn't a bad drunk at all, he just gets silly and sometimes compliments me too much and gets very lovey-dovey but i still panic just the simple fact that he drinks just freaks the hell out of me. 


This isn't the main problem though.. i obviously have many other issues with myself. I'm very insecure. I get jealous easily, etc. I've tried plenty of times to better myself and become a better version of me but even though i try i end up going back to my old ways. So, on thanksgiving day he said he would drink with his roommate and his roommate just LOVES to drink, everyday if possible so that kinda freaked me out. So it just went downhill.. i started fighting about it and all.. here's the thing he isn't a very confrontational guy. He can't even look at me if we fight. I asked him to skype and he refused but at the end said yes and that just made everything explode so he broke up with me. 


Fast forward to two weeks later, i've been trying to better myself because all that's happened has made me open my eyes. We've been talking daily still but obviously it is much more different. I know he clearly cares for me and loves me alot still but he's just too afraid to go back and go through the same thing again. This isn't the first time we've been close to breaking up and such though.. so he said there was no place to sew up anymore. He thinks we tried enough and i don't blame him. I've been through this same issue with my dad, always said he'd change then he'd do the same thing over and over again. Neverending cycle. 


During this time that i've tried to show a better side of me and all he has given signs that he does want me. He has said things like he loves me and misses me back to me but then he just goes one step back again and i know it's because he said he ain't confident and just today he also said that he worries because his family is worried about him getting hurt again. He also said he worried if we had a future together.. which he did. He said he'd like to marry me someday and build a family with me.


I know i've screwed up and i obviously don't want a bunch of hate.. trust me, my friends gave me quite the lectures lol. I just want some advice. Also.. we were going to see each other this christmas. I was going to go see him to where he is currently living. I thought about going there anyway and trying to fix it.. and actually show him i DO want to be better, not just for us but mainly for me because i'm also destroying myself and i don't want that anymore. And yes, i know it sounds like something out of a movie.. but since we are long distance sometimes it's hard to fix certain issues if not in person.. atleast that's what i think.. 

And yes i've been to a psychiatrist and psychologist but i might have to switch so i've been looking for options.

11750,Relationships,1x01e4,"We have been dating two years now, living together for 4 months. She has depression/anxiety and takes medication for it (Cymbalta, Ativan sometimes and there are others in the past but don't remember the names). As you would expect her mood swings can be unusual and quick to change. I've learned to deal with them, but the latest episode has left me at a loss for words.

Last Friday we finished dinner, she suggests going out to a store to shop. I kinda shrug the shoulders, meh I guess...and that's when it began. She completely shuts down. Stops talking to me all night, even runs out the house and goes without me (Even though I said I would come). 

In the morning I ask if she will keep up this mood, it's pretty childish. She says she's pissed, I know there's no reasoning with her at this point. Saturday goes quiet, she spends the entire day in the bedroom watching TV and doing makeup.

Sunday comes, I had been invited to a superbowl party with some guy friends. Obviously theres no point of sticking around for the conversation at home so I tell her I'm going there and won't be around for dinner. She asks why I'm not talking to her, I had been attempting but all I got were just ya ok goodmorning meh ugh etc. She starts crying in a fit (everything is my fault, I've done things to hurt her apparently...shes the one that's tried to talk to me and I've been avoiding her..etc)

At the top of her lungs she screams out I HATE YOU! ... I really felt it, it wasn't something just said in anger. I'm at a loss for words, kinda pace around try to reason with her, she says don't touch me, go have fun and party. There's no reasoning at this point. I take off.

Yesterday after work I ask how her day was. She says ok. Yep still strong silence. I've had enough at this point. I tell her theres nothing holding her here, if it's not working for her then she can leave at any time. I get nothing out of her. 

So that's where I'm at. I'm so hurt by this, it's childish and become so hard to deal with. We are looking at getting a dog and I really don't want to proceed bringing it into this environment, that can be happy and crazy all within one sentence. 

Anyone have advice on how to go ahead with this stalemate. I'm really feeling like giving up. This has been going on for a while, the ups and downs, but I've had enough...and I don't see any end in sight to her anxiety/depression issues. Put it this way, if she came home tonight and said she was leaving permanently I don't think I would shed a tear. 

I'll edit in: my sudden loss of care got even more cemented in at the superbowl party. I met a friend of one of the other girls there and we got along really well. She has a boyfriend and they sound like they get along great, it was totally harmless conversation but it made me realize there's a lot of really cool people out there and you never know who you will meet and where.

11755,Relationships,1rr5aq,"This is the girlfriend writing, we're both 23. Ultimately the biggest problem we have in our relationship is that we don't agree on a timeline for how things should progress so that both of our needs are met. We have talked about things a lot, but neither of us is sure what to do and now it has gotten to the point where our conversations seem like we are saying the same things. Which is why I have turned to the internet, because it's cheaper than therapy.

I have a son from a previous relationship. Long story short the guy was my high school sweetheart (also an abusive asshole but I didn't see that at the time) and when I got pregnant he demanded that I get an abortion and said that I was ruining his life and that I was going to be a terrible mother ect. 

I met my current boyfriend when I was 5 months pregnant on a trip with our mutual friends to San Francisco Pride, we now go every year as a family tradition. : ) We quickly became good friends and people soon started asking if we were together. Initially I kept friend-zoning him. Explaining that I am about to have a baby and that things would be hard (little did I know how hard things would get but that is a story for another time). 

We went to the movies and he took me out as friends and it was clear to me (and everyone around us) that he had feelings for me. I had so much going on that I was hesitant, I had just gotten out of a long term abusive relationship and I was about to have a baby. One night I gave in and said I just wanted to keep it friends with  benefits and see where it goes. We kind of gradually became something more. 

We took things slowly, very slowly. He just moved in with me this summer, after me asking him to for over a year. It was getting really hard because my son started calling him daddy (he noticed other kids at his preschool have daddies) and really missed him through the week. My boyfriend would go to school/work during the week and stay with us on the weekend. My son would say he wanted to go visit him and would cry in the mornings when he wasn't there. 

He was reluctant to move in because he is very introverted and needs his space. He agreed to a trial period over the summer and he hasn't run away screaming yet. Knock on wood.

What really got me worried about everything again was the other day our son was sick, and he called out of work to watch him (because I couldn't call out of my work) and on the phone to his boss he said I'm calling to let you know that I have to watch a kid tomorrow morning, he's sick and I have to stay home with him. After he got off the phone I teased him a bit for saying a kid like just some random sick kid someone dropped on the front porch. Not my kid, not even my girlfriends kid just a kid, some kid. I let it go but I am still hurt by it and worried. 

He has said before that he didn't feel attached to my son, like he was more like a little brother to him than his own son. Which is hard for me to wrap my head around because he has been acting as his dad since the day he was born. He just doesn't feel it. 

He says he can't imagine his life without us, but at the same time there is other things that he is wanting. He wants to travel, see the world and that is next to impossible to do with a family and responsibilities tying you down. He also has said that he is curious about being with other women, which I am bisexual and all for threesomes, but I am also human and insecure and I told him I need a ring first. He also has no idea what he wants to do for a living. Which is ok, I just wish he would figure out if he wants me. 

I know that I come with a lot of baggage, and you can't walk lightly into a relationship with a child involved. I am concerned because we have been together for over 3 years now and he is still uncertain about staying together. It's my feeling that if you love someone and want to spend your life with that person, you should know. Right? It's not like I am trying to rush things and we barely know each other. 

I have a kid, I have started my career and I am starting my BA in Human Development. I know exactly what I want, and I have told him. Mostly it has been a matter of waiting, with no promise that everything will work out or even a Yes no matter what else changes I am sure that I at least want you and your son in my life. I am tired of living with the uncertainty. Always wondering if he is happy, if I am what he wants, if this is going to work...ect. 

I want to get married. I want to have another kid. I want to be able to put down roots and have a sense of stability. I am pretty sure he is not ready for any of that yet. I don't want to throw away a really good relationship because of my lack of patience, but he cant even come to an agreement with me about a time frame or goals. For example 3 years is too soon, maybe by 5 years we can get engaged because we will be more established or even Before we talk about taking another step forward we both need to finish college and have a house and a white picket fence and 50,000 jobs. He just says I don't know, and I am not ready yet.

I just want to be wanted.

There was other issues that she found out about.

Anyways, we had started arguing pretty soon in our relationship. We still do. Just about different things. They typically do not have a resolution. We have been fighting at least twice a week. Its been a very bumpy relationship. We do have a lot in common, but i think our personalities clash. We are both going to school and what not. But she is going to be going to grad school soon. And has really been pushing me to move with her. But idk if i do. She is very pushy on many things.

We were just doing casual small talk at first but then it got on the topic of our relationships and she told me hers is going sour. Then proceeds to tell me she really regrets how she handled it all when her and i broke off. She said it all just seemed right. Which i agreed with. She then said if the both of us are single, she would like to give it another shot.
I guess my question is, what do i do? I mean, ive never been good at breaking it off with people. And my girlfriend is extremely sensitive person. I do care about her and dont want to hurt her.

She's been telling me how the students are so affectionate and show a lot of physical affection and how this has been bleeding into their lives at the hotel after school is over. I raised some concern with her showing so much physical attention (cuddling, laying on their lap, spooning) with men I've never meet before while also being in a completely different country but she led me to believe that she was only doing this with one of the gay teachers (Ben) in her group which I am ok with. 

 

 Yesterday I accidentally saw a Facebook message between her and Ben's straight roommate (Tom [20/M]) That concerned me. In these messages, Tom asks if he could come sleep in her room. The messages continue and she enthusiastically invites him up saying that she was also just about to take a nap. He declines stating that he needs to shower and will just take a nap later. She invites him up 3 more times and he declines all 3 times with statements like shiiiiiitttt go on without me and tempting... This conversation ends with her telling Tom that she is going to make him come and get his extra blanket sometime which leads me to believe he has slept over previously.

Now at this point I gave her the benefit of the doubt because I remember her saying something about how Tom's roommate had gotten too drunk and thrown up on one of their beds. She has two beds in her room and I'm ok with her helping out someone who has vomit on their bed. I was a little concerned with how persistent she was being even after he told her no multiple times and some of the verbiage but I tried to forget about it. 

I couldn't drop it though and I checked back later that night to see if there were any more messages between them. There was. 

She invites him up to come get his extra blanket and watch a movie at around 9:00 pm and tells him to bring some beer. He declines saying how he's tired and wants to just get some sleep  because they have a busy day tomorrow. She again is persistent on trying to get him to come up to her room with a string of invitations like how much do you want another blanket, I even cleaned off the bed for you, you kind of let me down, I was excited not to hang out alone for a minute. Still all of these could be taken as her being a good friend who is lonely and just wants some company. I could never decide what her intention  Up until she says this

 

&gt;are you naked?

 

WTF!! **Are you naked!? Are you kidding me!?** I've spent every day with this woman for the last 5 years of our lives. We've helped each other through depression and school. Lived in 2 apartments and now live in a house together and now she's **PERSISTENTLY** inviting a guy up to her hotel room and asking him questions like are you naked?. As far as I can tell there's no other way that message can be taken. 

He brushes it off with a oh man you're killing me. The conversation ends with her saying just call if you are freezing, the phone wakes me up. 

 

I'm not sure whether she as done anything with him yet but if she hasn't it's not due to her lack of effort from what I can see. Even though I can't prove that she's cheated on me yet, it still feels like she has. 

I know a bunch of you will say Just talk to her. Tell her how upset you are about this., but that brings up another issue. Her and all of the teaches she is working with are going on an overnight retreat this weekend. I have no way of getting in touch with her and she's spending a whole weekend with this guy. I don't know what to do with myself. 


Thanks for reading this. I guess I'm just making this post to vent and to get some other peoples opinion on the issues. I've had trust issues in previous relationships but I thought we were past this.

I have been with my SO for close to 4 years, I met her when she had just given birth to her son and have helped raise him, we got a house together about 1 year ago and that's when shit hit the fan so to speak.

She has always had issues with how she looks and has a very unhealthy relationship with food (she dusnt like to eat) every day I have to hear about how fat she is (she's a size 6 UK). She also has alot of trust issues from her past relationships.

I am a very independent guy I like doing my own thing but I still invited her to come the gym with me and set up a meal plan for her to try and get her to be abit more positive with everything. 

Unfortunatly this hasn't helped, I am so very close to leaving her because all of this is starting to effect my mental state. Im not happy when I'm at home I'm happy when I'm at work or at the gym. Im quick to anger now because of all the issues I have tried to help deal with on a constant basis.

I love her and I want her to be happy but it's not selfish of me to want to be happy myself and I just don't see myself being happy living with her. I have asked her to go see professional help but she refuses. Im running out of reasons to stay with her..

11766,Relationships,33o349,"Long time reader, first time writer. 

So first I'll add a little background to myself. I live in the UK, and I have a condition; IBS as well as an anxiety condition of which I've had for about a decade now. It's something which affects me a lot but over the last year or so I have been getting better dealing with, anyway, whole 'nother story.

We met while at university last year (last school year that is, so ~1.5 years). It was my final year and her, Sophie's, first year. We lived together in the same flat at my halls of residence, I being able to stay there due to my condition. Anyway, we weren't friends straight off the bat but were friendly and slowly became better friends. I had my closest friend end up leaving uni halfway through the year, so it was around that time that Sophie and I started to become closer. We didn't hang out much outside our flat so it was mainly when we were both home but when we did it was just the two of us and we just...talked  about anything...for ages. I'm an empathetic so people tend to be able to open up to me, but I myself don't find it easy to open up to people but for whatever reason we both felt able to open up a lot to each other, I think in part because we both have similar **big** things from our past (mine being the condition stuff I deal with, as mentioned above). 

I feel at this point it's important to add that Sophie is really quite pretty, easily seen as attractive, which was how I felt within the first few days of living with her but it wasn't something I tried to pursue. Partly because I felt it would be awkward with us living together, partly because I didn't think she'd ever go for me and partly because I've avoided relationships and well * a lot* due to my condition. So it was around this time where we were becoming very close (in very much a friend sense) that I was starting to have strong feelings towards her. I've had crushes and stuff before but this was more.

It took me a while before I asked her out. When I did it led to me discovering that she had recently started seeing a guy and that she wanted to see where that went. At the time I just felt relieved that I said something (I didn't pour my heart out or anything, just stated that I wanted more than what we had as friends) and we left it as we both very much wanted to remain friends and still talk and stuff like usual. All was normal for a while before she slowly pulled away until finally she got extremely mad at me for some non-reason and completely stopped talking to me, looking at me, just not wanting to interact with me at all. I had just been continuing as normal, trying to give her more space as she was with another guy but still everything ended up blowing up in my face, a big reason which held me back from saying anything in the first place.

We didn't end up talk properly again till moving out day (a couple weeks later) where we ended up leaving it at that we wanted to keep in touch with each other, seeing as I wasn't coming back next year. Didn't talk again for a couple months until I was back in town for graduation where we finally had a conversation (over text). She tells me a bit about her relationship, doesn't seem great, but I never bring up all the stuff that happened between in the past, and still haven't since, even though it bothers me. Ever since then we've keep in touch much more, talk semi regularly and I feel like I could call her up to chat even though it we've not since.

I guess what bothers me now is that I feel stuck, I thought the feelings I have for her had faded a lot. I've not seen her again since moving out, but we live semi-close and we've said about meeting up. She broke up with the guy again for a while but recently got back with him, inexplicably, and it just seemed to hurt me and I realised that I still feel *that* way so I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to lose her as a friend as she's important to me, I care about her a lot, and I certainly feel that she feels that way too but I don't feel like there's ever going to be anything between us in the future yet I can't not have feelings towards her. A lot of text, sorry bout that, but any comments/advice?

I wound up chatting to this older kinky guy online the other night and it slowly turned from an intelligent discussion on the psychology of kink into dirty talk via hypotheticals.

No pictures were included, and I honestly didn't contribute to the dirty talk, but I did allow it to happen.

I don't think my bf would break up with me if he knew, he's not exactly been perfect all his life, but I don't want to tell him if it's not a huge deal because I know he'd worry.

I've since deleted my account on said website and vowed to never let myself get into that place again.

I just don't know if it's worth worrying him over something that was unsavoury but not really cheating as such, and I KNOW will never happen again.

11768,Breakups,3bid82,"So this relationship began with the cards stacked against it. He was my rebound from a serious 2-year relationship that was heading toward the alter until he pulled the plug. We started as FWB, and had this immediate emotional and intellectual attraction (the physical part came after I saw him with his shirt off. :P) I told him everything, and he helped me work through my breakup and other life-long psychological issues. We were FWB for a little over a month, with plenty of drama in between (Vegas and an ex-boyfriend was involved...) before we decided to be official. Since January we've pseudo-broken up at least three times, but we could never stay away from each other long. It's been a rough road. For as long as I remember, we've fought regularly. Like real, emotionally draining fights that end in sobbing on bathroom floors, storming out in the middle of the night, hopping out of moving cars, etc. for both parties.

But strangely... we're perfect for each other. We moved in at 3.5 months and lived together for 2 months with almost no cohabitation-related issues. His friends and family love me, and my mom highly approves. Neither of us violate each other's pet peeves, and our biological rhythms are clearly in sync. We have complimentary life goals, and similar perspectives when it comes to philosophy and politics, but can NEVER seem to see eye to eye when it comes to our relationship.  We both find each other's quirks and flaws endearing, yet we always seem to fight about the same bullshit. (I'm overbearing, hard to please, and too selfish to be empathetic; he's insensitive, stubborn, and ruthlessly vindictive.) All of our fights seem to boil down to a failure to communicate, which we acknowledge, yet nothing seems to work. We're a couple of paradoxes, I guess. We're both each other's biggest support but also harshest critic. He is amazingly insightful when it comes to other people but ridiculously stubborn and short-sighted when it comes to our relationship.

Anyway, I just left the country a week ago for a summer internship. The week before I left, we had a huge fight that ended up in a breakup... which turned into a break... The day before my flight we had a long phone conversation and talked things out (or so I thought), and the break turned from two weeks to a week to three days. Then this morning, a normal conversation turns sour, he accuses me of turning our relationship into a shitshow (the fight I thought we resolved), triggering a strong response from me (since one of my biggest grievances this entire relationship has been about him acting like things are resolved and that he understands my perspective when he actually doesn't, and brings supposedly resolved matters up in later fights.) This time, it was him who called it off. I was exhausted and instead of diffusing my anger like the thought of a breakup usually did, it only fueled it. It also felt much more real this time. I guess it's easier to walk away when we're thousands miles away already.

Then immediately after he breaks up with me OVER TEXT, he asks if we can be friends. I shoot him down pretty sternly... and we haven't communicated since. It's been 15 hours, and it feels like days has gone by.

I want him back, but I know things need to change and we need to figure out how to communicate. PLEASE give me advice on how to make this work? After all this, I still think he might be my soulmate... but I don't know if he thinks the same. My best friend thinks I was more into this relationship than he was... but I've seen him at his emotional lowest and I know he's just as invested as I am. He seriously had trouble eating and sleeping when I went abroad/no contact for a week in April. I find it hard to believe he can walk away, but he just might because we're both so worn out from our repeated battles.

So... how do I get him back. How long should I wait to talk to him, or should I just wait for him to text first? My friends think I should actively try to move on and even he's said repeatedly this relationship does more harm than good... but against my every better judgment I don't want to let go. I'm a mess without him, but I know better than to just text him and tell him I'm willing to keep trying like I always do. This breakup seriously hurts a million times more than the end of my two-year. Help, please.

TL;DR; On again, off again with boyfriend. We're perfect for each other: he's brought me the greatest physical, mental, and spiritual pleasures of my life, but our incessant emotionally charged fights have also brought me to crippling lows. I feel like he's my soulmate, but I don't know how to salvage this. I'm a mess, and need outside perspectives. How should I approach this breakup? How can I change his gut reaction to a bad fight from wanting to break up to wanting to work harder...? And from an outside perspective... is this more trouble than it's worth; am I blinded by love?","Me [22 F] with my bf [23 M] 6-8months, dysfunctional &amp; unable to communicate, broken up but I want to reconcile, help",0.0,False,6.0,7.0,1435585858.0,/r/relationships/comments/3bid82/me_22_f_with_my_bf_23_m_68months_dysfunctional/,Romantic

He's very hot and cold - sometimes he does things that seem, for lack of a better word, relationshippy.  For example, buying me little presents, talking about issues he's having with friends or family... He got VERY freaked out in the past when I invited him to hang out with my friends, which was confusing to me because that doesn't seem all that serious.  But he did recently invite me out with some of his friends for the first time.


Is it too soon to have a conversation about being in an actual, defined relationship?  We technically aren't monogamous but neither of us have been seeing anyone else (at least, according to what he told me).

11772,Breakups,380r5a,"A bit of backstory, we met through a mutual friend. I found him goofy, attractive, funny, and a really nice guy with a good heart.  After hanging out semi-regularly for six or so months we started a relationship.

The start of the relationship quickly showed me warning signs. He had been home schooled his entire life. He had very religious parents who censored everything he watched/read/listened to, and everyone he interacted with. For about 10 years his only interactions were with his two brothers, and the small church youth group. All media had to be approved of by the church.

By the time he was done with high school he had rejected this lifestyle and went off to a four year college. At first I couldn't even tell he had been home schooled really, except for not getting some pop culture references and the like, but when we started dating I could tell that he was very stunted from lack of interaction with people his own age.

He means well, is a nice guy, but his maturity level was clearly much younger than 24. A lot of the things he did that he found funny reminded me of 9th-10th grade boys. He had very little motivation even though being pretty intelligent because his mother never made him do work really. (His youngest brother also has this problem). He didn't take a lot of responsibility, was so disorganized he could barely function (he would never have his back pack or anything to write on, he borrowed pencils from me repeatedly to take tests and quizzes and skated by making minimal effort and minimal grade with no care, no plans for a career), and he forgot everything - including taking his OCD medication which caused countless problems.

He also wanted to move really fast in our relationship, he was talking about meeting parents within two days, told me he loved me within a week(!!!!) of dating, and wanted to be around me 24/7 and stay over all the time. I quickly put my foot down and explained to him how this was not a good idea. He would listen, reel it back in, and then within a week be back at it again. It took a big fight to get him to finally stop saying he loved me. It was very unsettling.

Within a month I knew we weren't good for each other, he was becoming dependent on me to help him run his life. I knew I couldn't run both of our lives, and I would not want a long term future with him, but every time I tried to bring up the fact we were probably better off as friends and that this relationship was quickly growing unhealthy he would freak out. Like full blown panic attacks with tears, claiming he couldn't lose me. I became scared to break up with him in fear he would hurt himself and talked to some of our mutual friends about the fear. They kept telling me I just had to do it, but I just didn't know what to do. 

One night we went to dinner, I wanted to try and talk to him about my worries. He had always been very touchy, always wanting to hold hands/touch me. I didn't mind the hand holding but I kept telling him to lay off the grabbing at my legs/hand on my stomach/hand on my back stuff because I am just a shy person and don't like that stuff in public. At dinner he got even more handsy than usual, even trying to grope my butt at one point. I told him off and made him take me home.

He got so pissed, and asked why I am ashamed of him and our relationship. Why don't I respect him? I told him I wanted him to be happy but this relationship wasn't happy. Then he admitted to reading things I had written in my journal, which I have in my dresser. I had written worries about our relationship in it, and he had found out and been checking in on it every time he was alone in my room. I have moved my journal since then and got angry at him for reading, but then he got angry about that, and started accusing me of cheating on him because of messages from an old (married!) friend that I had on my texting conversations (at the very bottom with the old ones) that were from before we started dating. 

He left that night and said I can't do this with someone so cold, and hasn't spoken to me for four days, I assumed that was his we're done sign. I even gave a few of his things he left at my place to a mutual friend who lives at his apartment complex and she gave it back to him. Tonight he sent me a text saying 'Hey babe how was your weekend?.

I haven't answered yet because I am really confused. He took his stuff back, stopped speaking to me, hasn't tried to contact me until just now, and my friends all knew we weren't together anymore based on things he said/I said.

**Background**

I think I need to break up with my boyfriend. I fucking love him to bits but the last few months have been rough and I don't think it makes sense to carry on. He's been away this summer and the long distance has not done us any favors. Now, I've been in a long distance relationship before (with someone else; it ended for unrelated reasons), and I never felt so unloved/neglected then, so I don't know. I know *I* am capable of long distance. But with my current boyfriend I just feel like a burden to him. I feel like he just wants to put our relationship on hold, not put any effort in while we're apart, and then just come back like nothing has changed. It's called a long distance *relationship*, not a...long distance pause on the relationship...

Anyway, I've expressed this to him. He is sympathetic, I guess, but that's it. I mean, he feels bad that I feel bad, but he will not or cannot change his behavior. The behavior that is making me feel so shitty. We've had multiple talks about it in fact. Just the other day I was feeling really down about the state of things and was thinking about talking to him about it, and I was like, what's the point? Nothing I have said in the past has gotten through to him so why will this time be any different. I feel really let down. My partner is not...being a partner.

**The Issue**

So he's coming back soon, but gee guess what? Then I leave. I always assumed we'd do the long distance thing, but I really can't emotionally sustain this permanent state of unhappiness with a boyfriend who refuses to meet me halfway. It really sucks. I think we have to break up. I get melancholy looking at all the things I need to pack up out of our apartment. Anyway, we're both going to be here for a week. 

How the fuck do I break up with him? We share an apartment. Do I wait until for the end of the week and say hey I can't do this right before I leave? At least that way we would have one good week together before it all ends. Do I say it as soon as he gets back? Then we would have to spend a week in awkward misery together. I have to admit I've considered just leaving and doing it when I'm gone but that is shitty and cowardly, right? I do love him a lot, but he's just been so unreceptive to my unhappiness. I know there is no painless way to do this.

People with more breakup experience than I, what is the best (or...least worst?) way to go about this?

11774,Breakups,39r27a,"They text and call a lot.

He says they stay on different sides but isn't that awkward and uncomfortable? It's only natural to cuddle or put arms around each other, idk if I believe that they don't touch. He told me that she was like a sister and they had absolutely nothing going on, that I was the only girl for him. So it was to my shock when I found texts that they constantly exchanged I love yous and had nicknames for each other that were very couple like. He calls her the same pet names he calls me baby, boo boo etc. I even found that on newyears he texted her you're the best thing that has every happened to me. I was in complete shock and just left his place. He claims he sees her as a sister and has no attraction to her whatsoever because she is not feminine and he sees her as a guy friend.

Though he says he has always wanted to but she has been keeping to herself this year and he claims by telling me about her a few times and telling me whenever he was over at her house he had nothing to hide. He goes over to watch movies with her sometimes and will text me or call once in a while while there. Should I give him another chance or am I just blinded by him if I believe him?

We'd acknowledge each other by looks but he worked a full time job in the city so we'd never had a chance to talk. He made plans to take me on a date to the city or a bar and even asked around for recommendations of shows he knew I liked that we could watch. 

In any case, we hung out and talked for a couple hours for our first meeting. Then, we hung out again a couple days after, watched a few shows and had sex. We talked for a lot after and he invited me to sleep over. I didn't accept his offer because I thought I'd be annoying. (I'm paranoid like that.) A few days later he invited me to do whippets - we hung out and had sex again. The next week he invited me to a bar but because I'm underage we hung out again - he asked if I wanted to do something but because it was one in the morning I didn't know what to do. We hung out the day before yesterday with friends chatting and we hung out yesterday with friends again, went back to his room - talked then had sex. I really like this guy so thought I should've said something like I like you, let's hang out more or something but just asked if he was down to hang out this weekend. His best friend is leaving and his project for work is due Monday so he wasn't sure, but said potentially if he's free. He kissed me goodnight and that was it.

I've told my friends about him and a couple said you could do better or you're way hotter than him, even one of the guys I lived with drunkenly laughed at me and said he couldn't see it.

11779,Breakups,2jrw99,"Ok first ever post so I'll try do everything right. Last week my girlfriend broke up with me out of the blue. We met in college and started going out half way through our first year (3 and a half years ago). She needed alot of convincing but I won her round :) We were so happy together.

About 6 months ago, before college ended, we pretty much agreed to break up mutually (I brought up the topic) to expand our horizons, met new people etc. Also while she lives in my city for college, her family home is about 3 hours away so we were worried about college ending and the impending distance. However after hours of talking we both agreed it was stupid as we were crying so much etc and didnt want it to happen. So we decide to deal with new challenges when they come rather then pre-emptively .  

Now college is over the distance sucks now  but its not that much of a problem. We visit each other alot. She was looking for a job in my city (she said) plus she'll more than likely be back next September for a Post-Graduate degree. Last week she visits me. We have a great time, visit friends, go for walks, see a film - while this might seem irrelevant we also had sex 3 times, good sex.

Then that night we're just lying down in bed, holding each other and she says she  isn't in love with me like she used to be and thinks we should go on a break.It felt like I heard she died. She says I'm still her best friend. She said the sex was great. She says wants to still be best friends.

Since then I've been all over the place. Crying non - stop, drifting through days. She implied at first that this was a 'break' but talking to her since, its all I don't know what will happen in the future etc etc. And I think she's just letting me down gently.All our talking since has been through messaging. 

The thing I can't get over most is that its like she's been brainwashed. She gave no indication of any of this over the last few weeks and now its all, look its over - maybe things will change. I miss you - but not as much as you miss me.

I don't know what to do. I would have happily married her (and let her know it) but she just wont listen. I can't cope. Should I give her space for a few months then try win her back? Should I just get over it? If I want her to fall back in love with me, should I good cold turkey on her so she realises how much she misses me or keep talking as friend so she realises how much she loves me?

11782,Relationships,21q6le,"My friend of about a year is a very caring person. She was there for me through a really rough period and I appreciate every single thing she's done to help me through it. However, she has been acting really strange and her manners are impacting our relationship negatively. 

She is a strange person to be around. (Social anxiety, awkward, stressed out easily, some would say a little ditzy.) She is very open with almost everything, but not necessarily obnoxious. Her anxiety causes her to be very quiet sometimes, which doesn't bother me at all. When we met, she was single and had just gotten out of a year long relationship a few months prior. She was kind and reserved until she got to know me, then came out of her shell. 

We are close and very comfortable around each other. We talk about poop and laugh at gross humor together. When she is around anyone but me, she's shy like most introverts. However, ever since she began dating someone she has done a complete 180. (Our other close friend introduced them.) She has no problem displaying her gross humor in front of anyone and everyone, including my boyfriend. Basically, she farts and burps and acts as if she's around only me when he is around and it makes him uncomfortable because he doesn't know her that well and doesn't share our affinity for fart jokes. 

I respect that and like any reasonable person, I mind my manners and not fart on him or burp loudly. I say excuse me should a little burp slip out. My friend however, farts, burps and picks her nose in front of him. I don't care if she does it in front of me, she's like a sister and it genuinely doesn't bother me unless I'm eating. (Which is a barrier she has also stopped respecting.) 

I've asked her politely not to do those things in his presence or while I'm eating, yet she does it anyway and treats it like a joke then acts like I'm being mean when I act displeased. I have never been mean, but I have let her know that it isn't acceptable. He doesn't say anything about it or react in her presence, but has expressed to me that he is extremely uncomfortable around her because of it. 

When my friend and I are alone her behavior doesn't really bother me. 

Next issue: She is sort of a freeloader. She honestly does it unintentionally, but that doesn't change much. She lives with her parents who are well off, but doesn't have money of her own. Her parents put gas in her car but all the spending cash she gets comes from holidays or small pet sitting jobs occasionally. 

Whenever a group of us wants to go to lunch or something, one of us always has to buy for her. She'll order something then when the check comes be short on money. Or not even bring a wallet. When we buy drinks she drinks the most but doesn't pitch a single penny for it. She never offers to DD, which leaves me the only sober one taking care of her all the time.

When we (my other best friend or I) offer to pick up the tab she gets the most expensive things. She is really oblivious to the concept of money and where it comes from. I hate to say this because she is such a caring person, but she is not very bright. She doesn't see that we pay for all of her meals and things of that nature. I don't have much to spare, but don't have the heart to tell her no because she is so naive and doesn't understand. 

She is very messy. There are at least 3 nights a month she invites herself to spend the night at my house, trashes my room being careless and eats me out of house and home. Once again, it's hard for me to put my foot down because she is so fragile. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body and would be crushed if I told her how much her behavior bothers me. 

The farting thing didn't go over well when I tried discussing it, which leads me to think she won't understand my frustration on other issues. Sometimes I feel like I'm caring for a toddler. She has next to zero common sense. (I attribute it to her parents severely sheltering her.)

I know I should say something to her, but I don't know what to say. She is really really sweet, and I know for a fact she has no idea how much she is putting me/our other close friend out. I try to be as kind as I can be to her because that's how I want to be treated, but there's only so much I can take before I get really irritated. I love her so much and would never want to end our friendship, but she is so immature it's getting difficult to include her. What should I do?

11783,Relationships,1gavct,"So, professional counseling is obviously great when couples are having major issues. Does anyone have experience seeking counseling for minor issues or just to create space/time to talk about next steps in a fairly happy relationship? 


A bit about my situation. Both my boyfriend and I are divorced (from other people). We've been together for about 3-years. We started as a sort of casual, fwb relationship a few months after my separation (and about a year after his divorce). He didn't see other people for the first couple years, but since we weren't exclusive, I did. 


About a year ago, after my divorce was finalized and I felt ready for a relationship, I decided he deserved a promotion to boyfriend status. Our relationship is a solid 8/10 - great intimacy even after the honeymoon period; we peacefully coexist and can spend hours or whole days together without any issues; there's an abundance of mutual respect, patience, etc. That said, we have taken things very slow - although we treat eachother in all sorts of loving ways, we have yet to officially say the L word.


I'm feeling some uncertainly about where we go from here. We emerged from our divorces with completely different outlooks on love - I came out ready for a fresh start, with a new appreciation of what I want in a partner and what I have to offer. He came out of his (very messy) divorce unsure if he was capable of or interested in love again and prepared to be a lifelong bachelor. 


Since we started so casual, getting more serious feels like we are changing the rules half-way through the game. Things that didn't matter at all when we were just looking for someone to hang out with become much more important if we're thinking about whether we want to be lifemates. Since neither of us are interested in entering into another unsuccessful marriage, I'm thinking about whether it makes sense to go in for a bit of a relationship check-up with a couples counselor. It's obviously common for couples to do pre-marital counseling, but what about pre-pre-marital counseling? Any advice from couples who have done this? 

tldr: Relationship is promising. At this stage, could couples counseling help a relatively happy couple figure out where we go from here? Is couples counseling as useful for validation/planning as it is for fixing issues.

11787,Infidelity,1zyndw,"Hello reddit

This is a throwaway for various reasons - I’m on reddit for few years, often reading /r/relationships but I’ve never ever thought I’ll someday post in infidelity section. Guess I was a fool. Sorry if the stuff below is chaotic - I’m trying to put it in peaceful order. 

Short intro: I live with my girlfriend for 2 years now (my home, but we think of buying sth together) and we’re together now for over 3. It is serious, we love each other and we’re there for each other and our families (I helped her sister and father with their businesses when they needed it, she took care of my mom after a surgery when I couldn’t be there…). We’re slowly starting to talk about having a kid in near future. 

So, things looked perfect, until a little accidental discovery I did in the morning. I had to install some weird canon software for my new camera and her computer is the only in the household with a disc drive (Macs these days…). I had some doubts if I should do it when she’s away, but I thought I’m not doing anything wrong, right? As I was hiding all the windows not to mess with anything she had opened, I’ve noticed her logged in incognito mode into some weird email account. Curiosity took the better of me and soon enough I was reading a few emails she exchanged in past week with some dude writing from a weird (throwaway by the looks) email. There is a conversation from the past week.

The conversation is essentially this (fyi: it’s a translation - we’re not English), starting from the first message:

- He: I just came back from vacations and was thinking about you. What’s up? I hope you have everything that you want and ever wanted in your life. If not - remember that you have an adorer in me. Even if you won’t reply, I have so many ideas to draw!! :)

- My GF: Hello mr adorer :). Everything is good here, I think about you sometimes too - I have a sentiment for your person. I’d like to see you but at the same time I’m trying to want to be a good girl ;). My bf is going for a business trip on March 15, so maybe… You really tempt be with these drawings and stories

- He: Ha, and I doubted you still use that mail. I’m leaving for LA on Wednesday March 12, so I’m faster. Maybe a bit of “quantum physics with her whole probabilistic understatement”? Of course everything with words and pictures :). And wow, all this on Saturday March 15?

- My GF: I don’t use this account but gmail - I’ve checked  this account to see if you still remember me. Saturday sounds good but I should not invite you to my home so think about a place.

There 2-3 more emails from the guy without a reply (older, from the time when we lived together) but there is a shit ton of conversations between them from before that, which I really don’t want to dig into because it should not be my concern (but by a glimpse of the the subjects and dates it’s obvious they had a thing together going on for years before we meet). I’ve never heard about this dude from her, and she told me is that she wanted to invite her lady friends over for Saturday / Sunday when I’m away.

To me it looks like she’ll likely planning to spend a night with her ex. Maybe it’s supposed to be just a friendly meeting but I don’t really believe it, judging my the emails, date she picked and the secrecy with a hidden email account… I was thinking that maybe I should postpone my trip without telling her, leave on Saturday as planned and come back an hour or two later “from the airport” with whatever explanation (delayed flight) and see what she’ll do / did? Maybe it sounds like a shitty plan (I’m still in a shock and don’t think clear) but before I will make any drastic move I’d like to be certain of what’s going on - confronting her in an hour or two when she’s back will probably be messy - especially as at this moment I’m rather nervous and emotional and I don’t think I can have a rational dialogue with her over this.

tl;dr: Accidentally found out my gf is secretly emailing with her ex and they plan on hooking up when I’m away next week. Need your suggestions and ideas how to tackle this / what should be the next steps before I accuse her of anything and waste 3 great years together.

11789,Relationships,277viz,"So to use as back story, my GF and I have been together for 6 years, since we were both really young. We've had our ups and downs, from awesome times to breaks in the relationships. and for the last year it has been a LDR. 

So here's my problem that I want you guys to give me insight on. Throughout this 6 years, me and her have been madly in love with each other, and yeah, I kinda consider myself a clingy guy, we talk often during the day, and text quite a bit. I was always like this, and she mentioned several times that she likes the attention, and that it isn't a problem. Well, also and it pains me every time I think about it, but she emotionally cheated 2 times in the last 2 years, leading to a month break, and lied to me often, telling she was at home when she actually was hanging out with another guy, stuff like that. That although I don't quite know why, I forgave her all of those times.

I'm an insecure guy, I see a therapist often cause of personal issues not related to her, but I've also talked to the therapist but what my GF did and how I should react. Anyways, I've been lacking a bit on trusting her completely, and I'm turning quite controlling. A thing that I myself hate being, and that's why I'm here. 

The thing I wanna ask you is, how can I control myself on those days, where sometimes she doesn't answer my texts for a whole day and that get when she tells me what she was doing I feel like she's lying. how Can I not be like this, and how can I change myself in order to not ruin the amazing moment we are in right now.

The problem now is if I bring anything up he just kind of yells at me and tells me I'm being ridiculous.

I'm just not sure if this will turn around and is worth saving, especially since we're about to transition to long distance... I'm really confused about what's going on and I really feel scared to talk to him anymore because I feel like he's just so concerned with always acting happy that he dismisses my concerns.

A little bit of background info. He is American and I am Canadian. It is a little bit of a long distance relationship but hardly as we actually only live about an hour's drive away from each other. However, I always cross the border to see him as he is not able to cross at the moment, (speeding incident). He has been working on getting it pardoned and has expressed on how excited he is to come up and meet my family and so on. I never really had any suspicions as I have been the girl that he's brought over for Thanksgiving, to his boss' house, etc..

Things have been going great until I noticed he has been texting this girl. Now, he has introduced me to some of his friends and those I haven't met, he has usually mentioned. But not her. Not by name anyways. I will be there when he is texting her.. One time there was a small group of us hanging. He texts her, Oh I'm hanging out with so-and-so. No mention of me. It happened again a couple nights ago, Going to see movie with my brother. True, but doesn't mention me..

Soo, while he was in the shower yesterday, his phone was vibrating like crazy with all of these calls and messages. I hate myself for doing this, but it was just sitting there and I got curious and snooped. I am a guilty person.. I felt awful doing it but of course, my suspicions were eating me alive, (I really should have just asked him about this girl, I know). The texts I saw were quite flirtatious. Maybe more her, than him but he was definitely rolling with it and even flirted back. They would also send each other pictures.. A couple of them were her in lingerie. I also found out that they would go 'farming' together, (for those of you who play Ingress). He has told me about his Ingress farming but never mentioned her..

When he got out of the shower and came in, I couldn't help myself. I confessed to my snooping and apologized as I was having a sense that something was going on. I then confronted him about the girl. He told me she was just a friend and that there was nothing going on between them. But he admitted that she was into him and he has been flirting back. He said that he was irritated with my snooping but also irritated with how he has handled things..

We were not able to fully talk that day and I felt like I needed time. It has been silence between us except for I had sent a message asking to talk today. No reply.. I understand if he needs time- maybe we both do but I feel like I just need opinions or feedback..

The photo is fairly recent, and I guess I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt on that one. I explained to him that I was upset that he didn't tell me about it, as I did discover it by accident when trying to log into my own Dropbox account. He said he didn't want to upset me by telling me about it, but I explained that I wouldn't be upset if they were unsolicited; the fact that he told me nothing and kept the picture was unsettling. 

I asked what her name was and he told me some random thing. I think he lied about it because he was getting flustered. I also asked him to be honest if he was having any conversations with other women that I would find inappropriate and he said no he wouldn't ever do that. I had my doubts though.

I asked him how I would be able to trust him again as really, words are just words - I wanted some evidence. He was very hesitant to do so. I wanted him to let me read his Facebook messages as I have my suspicions that he may be having conversations that I would deem to be inappropriate (i.e. flirtatious or mildly sexual) with other women. However, I didn't do that because I didn't want to invade his privacy. Kind of regretting that now.

I noticed that he has deleted a lot of his Facebook conversations now I did not read them before he deleted them, as stated above, so I don't know what they said, but I just find it odd that he deleted them after I had this conversation with him. So is this a good sign? Does he realize that maybe he was having conversations that were not in his best interest and is moving away from that, or is this just the next step in hiding something from me?

As a little more background, I had an ex who had extremely sexual conversations with other women online and I had told this to my current boyfriend. I told him how much it hurt me when I found out and that to me, it's all cheating. Because of this past experience I'm afraid that I'm being lied to. I don't want to go down the same path I did with my ex because it was so destructive.

So I'm afraid that my reaction to this whole thing is biased. I really, really love my BF he is my best friend and I've never pictured myself with someone else. I'm worried that I might be over-analysing and making this a bigger deal than it needs to be.

First of all I know how hard it is to talk to anyone about weight. Tough love does NOT work with her and it's not anything I'm interested in doing. But my girlfriend gained so much weight and it has completely killed my attraction to her. There's just one problem.

She gained all this weight because she's in recovery from an eating disorder. She slowly put on the first 20lbs and I was in favor of that because of course when I learned she was so small because of her eating disorder, no way in hell did I want her to stay that small and risk hurting herself. I love her. I swear, i love her more than I've ever loved a woman and more than I ever could.

But it's just... the wya her stomach hangs down now. She has the thing you call a fupa because of the way her skin had to stretch out. I guess when she was an early teenager she was like 200lbs (she's 4'11') and she used throwing up and starving herself (so EDNOS) to keep her weight down, and then a life event triggered her to lose a ton of weight again. 

I don't know how to handle this. How do I tell her that if we're going to be together, I need her to put some effort into losing a LITTLE weight? I don't mean even 90lbs again. 120. Hell 130 might work. I just don't want to have to feel her stomach against me or see her flabby thighs wobbling this summer because it will kill the attraction even more.

 Anyway, I don't know if I want to stay with her anymore. We broke up at 11 months because she just wasn't making me happy anymore. After we stopped dating we talked and became just good friends again before she asked me out and I said yes. 

Now she's losing that ability to make me happy yet again and complains so. God. Damn. Much. I can't take it, I've told her and she has a mini fit. Besides that there's no real conversations, I don't feel that special connection anymore. We don't even see each other often... I feel like I'll be better off on my own, and besides all that I don't feel like I'm a healthy half to a relationship.

 She says she's on her way from Michigan to north Dakota to drop her sister (15f) off. My town is about a hour after the half way point of that journey.  So I called my uncles towing company and got them a tow and paid for it in full.  Stayed with them for a while to make sure that they were going to be ok. And during this time they fought over who got to sit next to me, made constant flirtation towards me and essentially made me think that these girls were really attracted to me (a rarity for me these days) 

 Unfortunately I had to go to work and was left with no alternative but to leave them at the McDonald's right off the highway.  (I know I know but it was that or get fired) before I left the older sister took my phone and put her number in it under jenny &lt;3 I went to work and continually texted her to make sure that they were still ok. And when I got off I asked if they were still in town so I could make up for leaving them.  She said they were so I hurried and went to meet them when I was told her engine block had a whole in it.  She said she had a plane ticket lined up for tomorrow morning out of a city an hour away and asked if I would bring her down tonight and we'd get a room for the night.(please note that some one came out from north Dakota to get the younger sister)

 Now this being said I am a huge believer that chivalry is still alive and did everything I could to be a gentleman.  And through all this she was still flirting with me.  To the point that when her sister expressed concern saying that I was probably going to rape her jenny said can't rape the willing.  

So now I am sitting here in the hotel with her asleep on my shoulder and wondering what I did wrong.  Did I assume too much?   Is she mad that I left them there?  I'm so lost right now and need an outside opinion.

We are juniors in high school. We were each other's first boyfriend and first girlfriend, so things have been bumpy, but overall very good. I am very much in love with her, and she loves me too.

Lately, however, Sammy has shown a big interest in drinking and partying. This has concerned me, but I've been brushing it off.

Her curiosity has been showing since around late-August, when she started talking about how she was excited to go to parties in college and drink.

Sammy was raised very well, and wasn't remotely interested in alcohol consumption when we started dating. I am the same way. I like to have fun, but I haven't been interested in parties or getting drunk. I did do it once, with a close friend, over the summer however. Sammy knows about this.

Things simmered down and our relationship was doing very well. Then Sammy let me know that she might finally have a chance to go to a party and get drunk, a week from this Saturday.

This put my stomach in knots. I'm very worried about what could possibly happen if she gets drunk at a party.

I'm worried that she might think she's ok enough to drive home. Or that somebody may slip something in to her drink. Or she may kiss or sleep with another guy.

I'm extremely nervous and anxious about this. She thinks I have trust issues and that I have nothing to worry about now.

I've talked with some of my closest guy friends, and all of them agree that they would be concerned as well.

She has told me that she feels I'm holding her back from being young and dumb and doing what she wants. I don't want to prevent her from having fun, but I don't want her to hurt herself or possibly jeopardize our relationship.

Any advice? She has been unwilling to talk to me about this because it has caused arguments, no matter how level-headed I have tried to be about it.

She has told me she wouldn't care if I went and got drunk at a party, with other girls or not.

11817,Dating,2mtk31,"Preface: boys are dumb, I'm quite possibly a robot with no understanding or capacity for this human disease called emotion, I'm 22, boy is 21.

Having said that, there's a friend of mine, whom I've known since early January of this year. We hook up when I'm in town (which used to be roughly weekly, when I lived an hour away, and now it's much more rare since I live four hours away), and we're friends, and it's a pretty sweet arrangement. The sex is good, we have fun hanging out, whatever. You get me.

We started sleeping together in early March of this year, and I moved away in early April. Not a whole hell of a lot of time, no, but it worked and it was pretty cool. But I actually kind of liked him--we'd been sort of flirting (I think, I'm horrible with people) over text since we'd started hanging out, and I thought he was nice and smart and funny. Plus, when we hooked up, I'd cook dinner, we'd do cuddly things and have sex, go to bed, then in the morning he'd make breakfast for us and even remembered how to cook my eggs. (Which is kinda sexy, okay, don't judge me, I'm super particular about how my eggs are cooked and someone remembering that is pretty awesome.)

Now, I'm not really someone with a great dating history, so my interest in someone isn't common. Between shitty boyfriend number one when I was eighteen (dated for a month or two, he hit me if I was unladylike and once told me that to get a breast reduction would be like slapping God in the face), shitty boyfriend number two when I was nineteen (we dated for almost a year, he was very manipulative and needy, and I didn't realize he was starting to border on abusive until he threatened to kill himself when I was breaking up with him), a couple dudes throughout that cheated on their girlfriends with me (one at seventeen, one right before shitty ex numero dos), and a guy that I saw but was never ~official~ with that was entirely self-involved (age twenty-one, and I put a lot of effort in while he did next to nothing; I outright told him I have an anxiety disorder and then he was utterly confused as to what was happening when I had an anxiety attack), shit sucks. I get it a lot, and it hasn't gotten better yet, ugh. But. Whatever.

So in late March, I ask him out, he says no. He doesn't do distance, and even living an hour away was pushing it for him, let alone four. Plus he's about to enter his last year of school, plus he doesn't really want a relationship. So I shrug about it and we continue cuddling and having sex and whatever, it's all good. I'm a little upset, but I keep it to myself, because I like what we have.

Fast forward to June, when I go on a date. He gets weird about it, like, hella weird. I mention that the guy kissed me at the end, and he keeps asking me if I like the guy, if we're gonna go out more, et cetera. When I ask why it matters, he says it matters that your situation with him is different than your situation with me. Which, to my apparent robot brain, is really baffling. Like, I don't really understand what gives him the right to say this stuff. We're not dating, we explicitly said we wouldn't be exclusive, so what gives? Skip ahead to mid-July and he casually informs me that him and his ex have been occasionally hooking up, and I go okay good for you quench that thirst and don't really care past that, because whatever.

Skip ahead to late September, we're continuing to talk and be friends, but also do the usual flirty shit and talk about sex, because why not, we know that's what's up, no need to be coy about it. I'm planning on seeing him around Halloween because a con is going on, and I mention that I'd talked with coworkers while closing about casual sex and how one had been all BUT SEX IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH SOMEONE YOU ~LOOOOOVE~ and how the way she'd spoken to me had rubbed me the wrong way. We trade thoughts on the subject, agree with each other, and then he goes speaking of casual sex, there's something I want to talk to you about, but it can wait until I see you in person. I *hate* cliffhangers, but he won't elaborate. So I suck it up and wait. But then October rolls around and I see him, and I ask at one point while we're driving what he'd wanted to talk about. Apparently, he forgot. (I'm still super annoyed, honestly, I hate that shit. Don't make me wait forever and then FORGET. Jerkbutt.)

So I stay there for about four or five days, we only have sex a couple of the nights because there are friends staying with us and whatever, it's all good. Great sex, he takes me to his favorite local restaurant after everyone's gone, we hook up, and I leave the next day (without saying bye because he had to leave early for class). It's all good, although I'm bummed I didn't get to say goodbye to my friend, I like saying goodbye when I won't see people for a while. But whatever.

And then this week happens. This week has been weird.

Point of reference, I live at home with my mother, and she was out of town for about five days. Since I had about three of those days off, I figured I'd get a bottle of vodka and have drinks and drunk text him for my own amusement, because I'm a loser and have negative six friends.

So night one, because I'd spent the prior night taking some pictures on my phone of a thrown together pin-up (cosplay is magic), I sent him some 'cause I knew he'd enjoy them and why the fuck not. They were, obviously, well-received. Hell yes, confidence boost. We flirt and junk, I take one or two new pictures for him, he basically goes holy shit what do you see in me again and I tell him pretty clearly (cute, funny, smart, nice, interesting). We converse about that a bit, he compliments me more. Then he's got to sleep and so do I, whatever.

Night two, he ends up going to a party and getting pretty drunk as well. I'm drinking too, because I'm a professional adult, what have you. We chat and make dirty comments all night, because why the hell not, we're drunk and young. I finally give up on drinking after about seven or eight shots' worth of vodka over four hours on a relatively not-full stomach (I'm a bit of a lightweight, in that I get drunk quick, but I can stay at peak fun drunk levels for a long time with maintenance drinks) and head to my bed. We're still talking, and I'm telling him about how a friend of ours is being drunk at me over snapchat (he's also at said party, apparently) and I'm making jokes about all kinds of things, because I love bad jokes and I'm pretty drunk. And then I'm kind of horny, because apparently I'm that kind of drunk that night, but touching myself isn't really working. I complain about it to him, and he says something about helping if he could, and I say that he's welcome to try. Suddenly, drunk sexting. (It works.) It was pretty surprising, I'm not gonna lie. But a bit later his responses get more erratic, and I pass the fuck out. Apparently, he was half-awake himself, and waiting on his ride to be ready to go.

And then a couple days ago, on my last night of being home alone, we're talking about dating things. Kind of. I'm telling him about how I'm advising a friend about romantic stuff, and we get into a talk about when it's appropriate to state feelings, how to do it, etc. A lot of what he's saying, at least from what I can tell, seems very relevant to our situation--people who mostly communicate via text, how the girl shouldn't be afraid to make the first move, that kind of stuff. To me, it reads like hey, I'm not directly saying I want you to ask me out, but, and it's making me feel weird and anxious.

Apparently, I really like him. Still, or possibly again, I don't know which. Either way, I feel my chest tighten up, because I'm not sure what he's trying to say and I'm confused, because beep boop I'm a robot. The conversation has some serious parallels to our situation, though, to the degree that I just go fuck it and tell him that I like him and don't know what to do about it because it's frustrating and confusing and weird. I also have a miniature panic attack and leave my phone on the couch while I pace around the kitchen counting off Fibonacci sequence in my head. (Numbers calm me down during anxiety attacks, and I couldn't manage to think of prime numbers for some reason.)

After making sure I've calmed down some, his response is essentially yes, I know, you told me that back in March before you moved, why is this coming up again and shortly thereafter he goes to bed. He promises things are fine (because I mentioned that I was pretty sure I'd fucked up/ruined everything, because anxiety's just the greatest and definitely doesn't make me worry everyone hates me, why do you ask), nothing's ruined or bad, it'll be okay, and we'll talk about it the next day. So I say okay, goodnight, what have you.

The next day, we don't actually talk about it at all, because he has class and I have work and then he's got something all night. We talk a bit about other things, like how hard I am on myself, some varying nonsense, nothing crazy. I'm a little bummed/annoyed, because he said we'd talk about it more, but we didn't. But whatever.

So then the day AFTER, I text him and ask if we can talk about it further, since he'd said we would and we hadn't. He's kind of confused, saying he didn't think there was much else to say, and we briefly review why he doesn't want to date (distance, school, doesn't want a relationship right now). And then he says he'd like to keep things the way they are, and I agree, because yeah, things generally work. When I mention being confused by the whole conversation, he says he was confused, because he could see all my emotions coming like a tsunami and he didn't really get why. (I then referred to the whole thing as the figurative kaiju of emotion emerging from the depths to wreak havoc.)

The biggest problem I have is that I still have no idea how he feels about me in relation to any of this, because he completely dodges that part of my questions. Every time. I don't think he'd even answer it if I asked directly. Plus, I feel like it sucks that I'm so confused, because it honestly looked like that's how it was going and then it suddenly wasn't. I don't get it, and I hate that, because I like to understand. But this shit be fuckin' inscrutable, mate.

Best friend says to be patient, but not Joseph Gordon-Levitt in *(500) Days of Summer* patient/crazy. Another friend says be patient, but if it's causing me distress when my feelings (re)emerge, maybe drop the benefits part of the friendship.

ADDENDUM: We aren't talking as much as we normally do the past few days, but I feel that's reasonable. We probably could both use the space.

11818,Relationships,2v90u8,"Before I start, here's a back story to all of this. 


It all began on tinder. I had a boyfriend (Sal) at the time and wasn't at all considering pursuing or meeting up with anyone, BUT I did. I did some things I truly regret and realized I wasn't happy with my relationship, but wanted to try and make things work for the last time. I ended up cutting off everyone I was talking to on the app, including my recent ex (James). This was also a day after we were supposed to meet up, but didn't. I later found out he was kind of hurt by this.


Anyway, a couple months later James messaged me something along the lines of are you happy with your boyfriend? I found this odd yet endearing. I figured him to be a fuccboi to be honest because all we did was exchange nudes and because tinder... So a couple months later I decided to get in contact with him again. I was in an odd state. I wasn't happy with Sal and making things work didn't work, but couldn't bring myself to break up with him. So I finally ended up meeting with James from tinder. He didn't care that I was with Sal and still wanted to hang out. Due to hitting it off and being extremely attracted to each other upon meeting, we had sex. So yes I did two time, again.. another thing I'm not too proud of. There is no excuse but things happen...


Guilt came over me of course and about a week later I broke up with Sal, whom I was with for a total of 3 years. Partially because I didn't want to feel guilty with James, I didn't want him to think I do this all the time and I decided to over all man up and cut off negative relationships in my life. 


We had fun together for a couple more weeks (Me and James). All we did was hang out in his apartment, watch movies, and craft. I'm not a huge date person and don't feel like it's necessary because you can get to know someone just as well by hanging out with them at their place. Obviously, it does get confusing because it could be leading to a relationship or just a fwb thing. I figured it to be an fwb thing and was 100% ok with that because I felt I wasn't ready to full on commit to someone anyway. However, he started saying little things like 'I like you', 'You're special' and so on. One day he even messaged me that he may be infatuated with me and couldn't stop thinking about me. So, yes, I started to develop deeper feelings for him. The fact that he was so open with sharing his feelings for me got me hooked. He even bought an air purifier because I'm semi-allergic to cats and he has two. AND yes, he asked me to be his girlfriend and admitted to being in love with me in two months time after meeting and me breaking up with my bf. I decided to go with it. I'm still not sure if this was because I was also really in love or really infatuated with someone who showed they liked me more than I let on.


We lasted a little over a month. The break up was generally mutual.


I noticed his attention difference. He barely messaged me or initiated our time together. Surprisingly, he brought this up before me and explained he was going through a lot of things, to which I had some insight. He got in a motorcycle accident a year ago and was struggling with getting off pain killers and finding what was next for him, as well as figuring things out with his ex who he had been with for 5 years (some back story - they lived together and she went away for school and he broke it off with her  because of the distance and because he felt like it was coming to an end... she's coming back and i guess their figuring out the living situation?). All in all, it made sense to me that he needed his time to think and reflect, and work on himself. I thought to myself that I needed that time too after jumping from one relationship to the next and decided I was fine with how things were, we didn't need to be in contact all the time.
I realized about a week after our talk that I had mixed feelings. I started to get paranoid and wondered if he purposely brought it up because he was purposely paying less attention to me and wanted me to break up with him so as not be the 'bad one'. So the next time we hung out I planned to go over what we wanted from each other because we hadn't established it. I also went over the attention difference again.. I wasn't completely fine with going through the week without so much as a message from someone who supposedly loves and cares for me. It was probably much and honestly now that I think about it.. this isn't even something I should even have to ask from my SO, anyway I asked if he could meet me in the middle in terms of attention, shoot me a message here and there, but only if it were out of willingness... He said he couldn't do that and that he had too many things on his mind to promise something like that. He said he couldn't fully be a good boyfriend to me right now and he should be giving me way more. He explained it wasn't because he didn't want to be with me or not ever see me again, he just couldn't give me any of the bare minimum I was asking for and that wasn't fair to me. He even said he'd steal me from anyone I was dating in the future haha. 


Again, this gave me more mixed feelings. I'm not sure if he's bullshitting or actually looking out for me.  It's been two weeks since we decided we should ditch the label. Since then we've hung out (he's messaged first) and still have sex. He told me he wanted to talk about us more, but hasn't brought it up. 


I am just over all confused about this whole thing. We're still having sex and having fun together, so has our relationship turned fwb? Or is he making it go down that path because he is slowly ripping off the band aid of being together/seeing each other because he doesn't want to hurt my feelings and doesn't want anything to do with me?

11820,Relationships,298fo8,"Me and my girlfriend met whilst travelling in Australia... we are two quite different people, but we connected so deeply and fell in love so quickly. I'm British and she's Canadian, and met in a hostel during the Aussie summer. I've never felt like this for someone before, and neither has she... it started off with attraction, grew into affection and quickly became passion. We had different travel plans but we kept changing them to spend time together in different places, each time thinking it would be the last but then not being able to resist seeing each other again. We ended up spending the bets part of 3.5 months together, and whilst we had a couple of problems, it was always overruled by our feelings and love for eachother.


Unfortunately she had a return flight to Canada booked, where she had school and finding a new place to organise. I was only a few months into a year long visa, and had a lot more travelling to do. Parting ways was the worst fucking feeling, we dreaded it in the weeks building up to it. We cried, we allowed ourselves to share our dreams to reunite, but in the end she left and we were both heart broken. But it didn't take long for us to get back on the phone to each other and make plans for me to visit her in Canada after I had travelled a bit more in Aus, but most importantly earned some money. I was almost broke, and needed to work hard for 10-12 weeks before I had enough to go to Canada and last a while without working (can't get a working visa till 2015). The first 2 weeks was hard as we missed each other, but overall we were still madly in love and all was good. I got 2 jobs straight away and was saving like crazy.


We're now over 6 weeks in. The love is still there, but distance is taking it's toll on our emotions big time. My GF is a passionate, artistic and emotional person, and has never had a serious relationship as she spent the previous 5 years living a wild lifestyle. She is past that stage now and is looking for something deeper, and really feels the same way I feel about her. But she is struggling a lot. I am too, but I'm more mellow than her. Our differences are causing an inbalance in our relationship, which along with not seeing eachother is causing our doubts and insecurities to manifest as pain and intense, emotional debates. I know that being together would be different, as the amazing time we have together and the physical side of things is always the main factor. 

The negative things have been becoming more and more frequent, and mainly focus around her not being happy with how I wasn't sharing all my worries about us with her, as she wanted to be very open with me. I wanted to be like that too, and I tried but what I shared made her think I shouldn't be sacrificing being 21 and single for her, and she almost ended it. I don't care about that, I'm not that kind of guy and I feel so strongly for her I just want to continue what we have. 


Things have come to a head recently, and we're in the middle of a huge fallout. I want to take the emphasis away from the negative but I don't think she can, as she's feeling things so strongly. I just want to figure out how we can last the next 6 weeks without completely exploding and losing the love and affection we have for each other, as I know we can figure it out when we're together again. Any advice would be amazing as I'm seriously struggling, as is she, and our communication has temporarily stopped because the intensity became too much (we were speaking before and after work, sometimes during work, about really intense things). If we survive this then we need to find a new way to do things. We come so far, I don't want for it all to be a waste.


I'll give as much detail as I can in answer to any questions. Thanks for reading.

11822,Relationships,2ostfr,"My fiancee and I have been together for about seven years. We've lived together for over 6 years and as far as I know, we both have stayed faithful. Recently, about a month ago she called off the engagement due to a fight. I had said some hurtful things a week prior during an argument and again during this argument. Unbeknownst to me, she had been growing severely unhappy in the relationship. 

I won't go into detail, but the main issues we have are sex (frequency and satisfaction), communication, doing things together, and general intimacy. After talking with her and doing some reflecting of my own, I agreed that those have been sore spots on our relationship, but that she was incorrect in her accusation that I did not care about her needs. I have had various medical and mental health issues that have made my life a living hell and until recently, Sept 2012, I haven't had health insurance. One of my problems was a form of arthritis that attacks your spine and SI joints. It made me go to the emergency room twice. When your SI joints are fusing, sex is the last thing on your mind. 

I've also struggled with depression and ADHD. Only since Sept 2013 have I taken ADHD medications daily. This has also been the only period of time where I felt like I could perform sexually without pain or worrying about losing my erection due to fear or distractibility. 

That being said, I felt that even with my health problems, there were issues with communication that have always existed in our relationship. My psychiatrist recommended we see a couple's therapist, who then recommended we try something called discernment counseling. Which is supposed to help couples determine if they should stay together, breakup, or try couple's therapy. 

My fiancee agreed to discernment counseling. I know she has trouble opening up to me, so I can only imagine the difficultly she has talking to a stranger about private matters. I gained a lot of respect for her by her doing this. We had an initial consultation where the therapist essentially recommended discernment counseling, a couple individual sessions, and a full-length discernment session. At the end of the discernment session, we agreed to meet again on a Saturday.

Well, a few days later we get to talking about the session and she says that she wasn't impressed and that she doesn't understand how discernment counseling helps us make up our minds. She then says that she's unsure if she'll attend the next session.

Last night is where things soured. We were talking on the couch and I told her that I felt like sometimes I'm playing a game where I haven't been told all the rules. That I feel like I'm missing something critical and all my work helping the relationship is futile. I asked her plainly if she has feelings for anyone else. She looked me square in the eye and said I've told you before, NO. 

Flash forward to later that night in bed. I guess I should point out that we are technically separated, but still live in the same house, sleep in the same bed, go out to do things, and eat dinner together. It's a strange setup, I know. Anyway, laying next to the love of your life for a month without as much as a peck on the cheek would drive any man crazy. I ripped the comforter back and tried to kiss her. She blocked me and I ended up kissing her neck. I felt horrible and I know she did too. 

Feeling I had ruined everything, I got dressed and went to sleep in my car. After an hour or so I came back inside because it was cold. That's when i did something awful. I snooped on her phone. On her phone I found an email she had sent to herself around dinner time. It didn't say who it was to, but in the email she told this person that her feelings were more than a schoolgirl crush and that there was just something about them. 

I couldn't believe my eyes. I stormed into the bedroom and confronted her, asking her how she could do this to me. She justified it by saying it was only a crush and that she was just typing out her feelings and sending it to herself, like in a therapeutic way. I didn't understand why she lied to me. It has made me question everything. If she lied about this, did she lie about not dating other people during discernment? What about sex? If she'll lie about a crush, then anything is fair game! 

I love this girl. I understand that even people in healthy relationships get crushes on people, that's normal. But I don't know if it's worth repairing things with someone who doesn't care about me enough not to lie to me.

11825,Relationships,2050vg,"Hello reddit, first time being an OP here.

I need some help on how to handle my current situation. Me and my BF have been together for a couple of months, bf has some mental health issues but we're getting along quite well despite them. 

He's overweight, hasn't always been and it's a sore spot to him. He's talented but would like to be more skilled, another sore spot. I still like him a lot, I think he's sexy, fun, talented etc. and I like to tell that to him. He initiated the relationship so I'm sure he finds me attractive and good to be with as well. 

I've always offered my help and support when he's struggling with body image issues or work. It's one of my ways of being supportive to compliment, but my compliments seem to bounce right off. He tends to think he's not in the position to deserve any compliments yet. It is insecurity and depressive thinking and we know it.

It's tiring for me and I'd imagine it is to him as well. There are days when I feel very sad and rejected because of this.

Would it be more merciful for both of us to stop complimenting him or take a different approach? I'm not overly enthusiastic with compliments or tend to exaggerate (I know how to criticize as well), but I do have the need to tell him how attracted I am to him and how proud I am when he succeeds at something. Still, if this does more harm than good something needs to be done differently.

He's not always like this, but it's very common. We've talked about this, that's how I know where his reluctance comes from but I still feel bad about it.

What are your thoughts on this?

11826,Dating,2fj2mz,"I met a girl on Tinder for a casual hookup. There ended up being good chemistry between the two of us and we transitioned into dating. We've had five dates so far and everything has been quite well except for her abusive ex of 8 months getting involved. She had broken up with him about 4 months ago and I was her first venture back into the dating scene. As soon as word got to him about the two of us, he began calling her phone and leaving very threatening voice-mails and demanding answers to some very private questions.

Shortly after that ordeal he got a hold of my number. The two times we've spoken he told me in a very threatening manner that he happens to have friends in various biker gangs and doesn't appreciate me seeing her. He then gave me an ultimatum to either stop seeing her OR to not set foot into his city. I've only talked to him for 30 minutes or so; but I've come to the conclusion that he isn't the most mentally stable individual.

I'm not a fan of getting involved in situations like this; I tend to avoid conflicts because my time and effort is better spent doing more productive things. And because of my lack of experience dealing with threats and unstable individuals, I'm reaching out to you /r/relationships. She has told me that he has never followed through with any of his threats over the past few months of being broken up, but I feel as if him seeing her with a significant other might be enough to give him initiative to actually do something.

She wanted a relationship while I was worried about getting hurt, but she convinced me. Then she wanted me to go live with her to another city, which I was happy to because I honestly thought it was going to work out.



A week ago she started becoming cold and distant. I realized I was losing her, but when I confronted her she insisted she still loves me. Last weekend, a day before we were to leave for the city together (flatviewing, she had university, I had a job interview) she says after I insist on knowing the truth that she no longer feels the way she used to feel about me. She said she doesn't know why and claimed she hadn't met anyone else. 



Nothing changed about our relationship to this point. I was devastated. She told me she needs some time alone, a break or something. I suggested breaking-up, but she refused that it seems hasty and rushed.



I left for the city because I wanted to attend said job interview anyway. After the interview, I called her and asked to meet up. I told her to meet me at the bus station, which probably was what tipped her off. She texted me If you want to break-up, we don't have to meet for that. I texted back Ok. Its over



I did it because I figured it was the only way to save the relationship. My logic is that if we took a 'break', she'd know that I was just on hold and she had the power in that relationship, so by breaking up completely, she may just realize if I am worth losing or not.

On one hand, she is overbearingly clingy, wants to text all the time, and also wants to hang out all the time. This doesn't match my emotional needs; I'm perfectly fine just texting occasionally throughout the day (like in the morning &amp; at night) but to her that isn't enough. We have talked about it before, and we did tone it down a decent amount, but it is still not satisfactory to me and she knows that but blatantly ignores it. 

On the other hand, she is a sweet, beautiful girl who I do enjoy spending time with, within reason. We are each other's first bf/gf and each other's first everything else as well. Use your imagination.

I have no idea what to do though. Part of me wants to break up with her and find someone who I have more in common with who also shares the same hobbies as I do. I have quite a few hobbies, my gf on the other hand pretty much ONLY watches Netflix when we're not together. I have encouraged her a million times to find hobbies or do stuff with friends, but she wants none of it. It's really frustrating. 

The other part of me wants to work on our relationship together and become a better couple. Her college offers a free couples' therapist which I am open to, but I'm a bit skeptical as to how well therapy would work for us. It feels a bit silly to be going to a relationship counselor at 18 years old, but I am still open to it nonetheless.

11831,Relationships,3eynng,"My BF and I have been together one year.  The first 4 months of that was long distance.  As for the way he treats me, everything is fine.  He's the best partner I've ever had, by far.  

The problems actually started immediately, I just didn't realize they were problems, if that makes sense?

He had been at the job he had when we got together about 7 years.  He was laid off.  He's a programmer, the company switched to a proprietary language, and his position was eliminated.  This happened after we'd only been together a month or so.  They gave him 3 months severance.  His work history before this point has also been solid from what he and everyone else has told me.

He also stays with his mother (84F).  This came to be after he broke up with his ex before me, that he was with for 8 years.  She cheated on him, so he came back to his home state.  He moved in with his mother temporarily.  About 6 months after he'd moved in, she had back surgery which she had a very difficult recovery from.

He never left.  It's been almost 8 years.  She does need some help around the house, but she's able to cook for herself, dress herself and perform hygiene.  She just needs help with heavier tasks.  

Fast forward to now.  I really saw a future with this guy.  I could see us moving in together, getting married, having a couple of cats and a nice, simple life.  I've never seen a future with anyone before him, and he says the same about me.  But here are the issues....

He still doesn't have a job.  I moved to his state, 1800 miles away from where I lived.  It happened sooner than we'd anticipated due to some unexpected circumstances, but we considered that a good thing.  The problem is, it's been nothing but bullshit since I got here.  EVERYTHING is red tape.  I got an interim driver's license here until I could produce my birth certificate.  My birth certificate was 1) destroyed in a fire and 2) ammended (the spelling of my name was changed) so it's taking longer to get it from the state I was born in than it normally would.  The interim license here is valid ONLY for driving, not ID or employment.  My old license is punched/notched, which renders it invalid.  I don't technically have a driver's license in any state right now.

I'm having trouble finding work.  (Even if I did, no ID anyway).  I knew right away I'd need a class to get additional certification for this state, which I took.  Now they're telling me I also needed a prerequisite class (maybe) which I can't get into for several months, and even AFTER I'm certified it still takes about 3 months to receive your physical license.  There's also problems getting my transcripts from my previous school.  I've been applying to semi-related things, but since I'm not actually qualified for them, I haven't been getting many callbacks.  The one good lead I have is a HUGE, think $8/hr pay cut from what I would be making with my certification.  

I can't register my car.  It doesn't pass inspection.  I need money and a job to fix that, I need a license to drive it, I have none of those things.  

My unemployment runs out in 2 months.  I'm sinking, and I need help.  I don't have family that can help me out.  I don't have a mom to stay with for a while.  I don't have a dad to borrow from.  I don't have a grandma to give me her old furniture, I sold everything when I moved here, so even if I went back to the state I lived in, where I can work, I'd go back to a completely empty apartment save for my bed, TV and bookcase.  

My BF's earning potential is MUCH higher than mine.  Jobs at his level are $35-40/hr.  Jobs in my field, which I love and wouldn't want to do anything else, are $18-22.  Between the two of us we'd be doing great.  But *I need help getting on my feet*.  He knew that.  He knew I didn't have a support system.  He knew I don't have family.  The agreement was that when I moved here, we were both going to find something good enough for now and pool our resources.

It's not like he's done nothing.  He's registered with several staffing agencies, and he goes to career fairs.  But he's not *pursuing* anything.  He doesn't call the agencies back, and he says he hates networking.  He says he hates living with his mother but yet we're always playing Beat the Clock when we're together so he can be home for dinner or else she'll bitch.  I've told him that he lets her walk all over him and he agrees, but he does nothing about it.  

I relied on him to support me for a few months, or at least HELP, while I got everything worked out.  Instead, he's jobless and living at home.  

I gave him a deadline.  I gave him 45 days to make SOME inroads towards employment.  Even phone interviews.  It's been nearly a fucking year!  Even if he didn't get the job he interviewed for, someone at a company would be more familiar with his qualifications, and keep him in mind if something opened up.  I said if he hadn't made any progress toward finding a job in that time, our relationship was over.  If he DID find a job, he had 1 year from his start date to be out of his mother's house. 

I've now got 1 3/4 feet out of this relationship.  I can't rely on him.  I'm in a bind that I can't fix within the time I need to fix it, and my *partner*, who I threw everything away and started over FOR, just says he wishes he could do more.  Well, stop wishing and GET A JOB!!!!  

I do sort of understand the living with mom thing.  He wasn't planning on getting into another relationship, it was cheaper for him and benefited her, and allowed him to do more of the things he wanted to do.  He went to a lot of conventions and events, saying it was an escape, that was where most of his money went.  I'm thinking if he really wanted to escape, he'd have been saving for an apartment.  That way, he could have his own space to do whatever he liked in, whenever he felt like doing it.  

I shouldn't have to tell a man his age any of this. I shouldn't be in this position when he knew this is what I'd be facing if I moved here.  It seems he wants all the benefits of a relationship without having to perform any of the duties or take any of the responsibility.  

So I'm basically done.  But I did give him a timeline.  I really doubt he'll find a job in that time, but if he does, maybe we'd be OK.  Like I said, interpersonally, he's respectful, funny, attentive, affectionate and wonderful.  And I can see where it's easy to get stuck in complacency.  I'm just not sure I could get past that threatening to leave is what it took to get him off his ass and take on adult responsibilities.  

So, should I give him the time I've said I'll give him, or say I've reconsidered and I can't do this after all?

I didnt sleep that night and instead just stayed up stressing myself out and becoming extremely depressed and crazy. upon her waking up in the morning we started arguing about how she just went to sleep when i needed her to be there for me. I had a breakdown and got irrationally mad at her over nothing. 

Now its been a few days since thats happened and she has said were back to being friends. that fight changed my mind and now i cant change it back. We havent really been talking and every time I try to bring up what happened and try to work through it and talk about it she either doesnt respond or says shes too tired to discuss it. Ive asked her several times if shes willing to work through it with me and the only answer ive gotten has been idk several times. I dont know what to do anymore and its driving me crazy that shes just able to let go of 7 years of the best memories of our lives over one stupid fight when ive stood by her side no matter what shes said to me or done.

11833,Dating,3e8qlw,"I started hanging out with a co-worker a few weeks ago. It was his idea to hangout in the first place. At first he would ask me to hangout and then he'd bail at the last minute. I told him that if he kept doing that I would never hang out with him again and he responded with a nooooooo. He never canceled our plans again.

He started calling our outings to restaurants dates. He then asked me through text message if I liked him and I said yes. I asked if he liked me and he said he did. He took me on nice dates- I'm talking wining&amp;dining and running up an expensive tab. I would offer to pay (I wasn't assuming he would always pay) and he never let me pay. He asked me through text message what I was looking for and I said I don't know. It depends on who I'm with. I like him but didn't want to instantly spill the beans and say I was looking for a relationship. I wasn't necessarily looking for a relationship. A few days later in a text message he asked Are we dating? What has happened? I said I don't know, are we? He said I don't know. Maybe this is a convo to have face to face I agreed. When I asked what he wanted he said a real relationship. I asked him to clarify what he meant by that and he said a serious relationship. Two days later on the phone he asked me what are we? I said Let's talking about this in person on Friday. We had plans that he made for Friday. He was okay with talking about it then. 

Thursday night he was texting me and calling me babe. He said he wanted to make love. I said It's a little soon for that don't you think? He said Why? I said Let's talk about this on Friday if that's okay? He said Sure. If you don't trust me. I said I do trust you. He said you should. Then he told me he wanted me and that he wanted to kiss me all night. So I said I'm all yours from tomorrow to Saturday morning He then said he missed me even though I had seen him at work 6 hours earlier.

Friday came and we had a great date. We went to a comedy show and he had his arm around me the whole time, he kept kissing me. When we left the comedy show and walked to dinner he held my hand. We headed back to his place for a sleepover. I didn't go past third base with him. We cuddled when we were falling asleep and when we woke up in the morning.

In the morning we went and got breakfast but he was acting different. He was acting like a guy who never called me babe nor was he acting like the guy who wanted to make love. I thought that was kind of weird.

On Monday I realized we never talked about what we were. I brought it up on Monday night when we were hanging out and he was like I like hanging out with you but he was never clear on what we were. I kept pressing the issue because he brought it up twice. He then acted like he never brought it up and kept calling me crazy. I couldn't really let it go and it bothered me pretty badly. It was as if he flipped the script and never meant half the things he said.

Yesterday he chatted me at work to ask if I was okay. He kept saying that me asking what we were so soon was a bit much. Meanwhile I only ever brought up what we were in the first place because he kept asking! He then said he wasn't looking to be exclusive with anyone right now. He apologized and said he wasn't really sure what happened. 

A few hours later I ran into him in the cafeteria and he said hey, how's it going? He caught me off guard so I said nothing. Then he chatted me and said What's wrong? You look pissed. I didn't respond because I was at lunch and he said Are you not speaking to me now? That's weird I said I'm good, thanks. I was eating lunch. 

Today he walks over to my desk and I'm not even paying attention and he starts talking to me, asking me how I am and then keeps telling me I'm crazy. He also asked why I wasn't talking to him. UMMM, obviously I didn't feel like talking to him otherwise I would!

Then he chats me saying not really sure what happened. just being weird. I said i'm being weird? and he goes so that whole situation was normal to you? He was talking about what happened on Monday night. I said more like what you said and did He then said I was very straight forward. I said I like hanging out with you. You were trying to lock down a relationship. I never said I was trying to lock down a relationship. Those words never came out of my mouth. He then starts saying that I acted crazy and should have warned him that things would get weird. Excuse me, things would get weird because I brought up something he said first? Then he starts saying he's sorry he wasted my time and blah blah blah. He would not stop calling me crazy. I am so uncomfortable and I just want to be civil. I don't need to be his friends or have a convo with him but I don't want the hostility. Unfortunately we both are members of the same gym so I am bound to run into him there.

People of the internet- why on earth would a guy act like this? To me he's the crazy one. I know I pushed the boundary by hooking up with a co-worker (thank goodness we didn't get our freak on!) but how can I get past this and be able to work in peace again? I'm not comfortable with him behaving like this. I was ready to drop it and just move on. He's an impatient person and a serious over thinker.

tl:dr: had a thing going on with a co-worker, it ended and now he's acting crazy.

11834,Relationships,2zxqdc,"This is going to be a long post- Im sorry in advance. I just want to be thorough. This is important to me.

My boyfriend is amazing. He's intelligent, and kind, and has a great sense of humor. The first time I met him I got this really strange feeling, and it sounds weird, but I was sure I'd found my match. I'm not a sentimental person, but there's just something about him….he is special.

A few years ago his parents got divorced. I didn't know him then, but I think it changed him. He developed an eating disorder and severe depression. Present day, I think his mental health is good. We are very open about it and he usually keeps me posted on how he is feeling.

PAST 

We started dating Winter of 2013. I couldn't believe how well we worked together. We complemented each other, and both liked a fair amount of time alone, which was convenient. Things were going really well. Or so I thought. He broke up with me in late September of 2014, stating the relationship had run its course. I never saw it coming. He even told me he was excited. It didn't feel real. I was devastated. Just thinking about the pain I was in hurts. It was such a hard loss. I've had relationships end and cried about it, but it's never felt so wrong or empty. It didn't even seem to phase him. He dumped me and then later that night he texted me asking what movie he should watch.

I felt so small. How could someone I love cause me this much pain and not even care? Later he spiraled back into depression, and then his cat was hit by a car. He was fragile and alone. And I was there for him. As a friend, not a girlfriend. He fell into a bottle and was suicidal. More than once I would go to check on him and find him passed out at his computer, fully dressed with a handle of vodka on the floor. It was heartbreaking. I just wanted him to be happy.

I encouraged him to seek counseling and he started a new medication. By November/ December we realized we both missed each other and decided to give it another go. We officially got back together in December.

PRESENT

I don't think he is as serious about this relationship as I am. I know we are young, but I really actually love this guy. I would give my life for him. I've loved guys before, but this is a person I know I could love forever. He tells me he loves me frequently, and he's very affectionate. He respects me, and doesn't get huffy when I don't want to have sex or hold grudges for when I'm being a brat. He is my best friend, and we make an excellent team. He is a catch.

Recently I asked him if it's wrong that when I envision my future, I picture one with him in it. He said he didn't think thinking that way was wrong, and followed by telling me that I was amazing and that he was glad we are together. That he is really enjoying being with me. But he never says he wants a future with me in it. He was talking about what job he get when he graduates this fall, and he briefly mentioned one where he'd make $30,000 a year. I told him it hovered around the poverty line and he said something like, I'll be single with no kids, and I don't need much so I think I could make it work. We aren't close to marriage, but I don't think he even thinks I'm worth marrying. Aren't most lovestruck guys supposed to be all mushy and ya know, talk about the future they want with their SO? I guess I'm happy he is realistic, but I don't think I'm being stupid or impulsive when I say I want to marry him. I didn't even know if I wanted to get married before I met him. If we keep dating, and there are no big problems, I want to marry him. I want to have his curly haired babies. I want to grow old with him. I don't date for fun. Not when it feels like this.

Today

My best friend came down this weekend with her boyfriend. They are so passionate about each other. He loves her, or else is entirely infatuated. They plan to move to Portland together. They've been together for about eight months. And while I don't envy her the boyfriend, I envy the way he treats her. The way he looks at her. He is so in love, and I feel like even their eye contact is intimate. Am I missing out on being loved? I know *I* am in love, but I want someone who is just as crazy about me as I am for them. I don't know if my boyfriend *needs* me. 

So I am nearing a crossroads. Do I stay with this amazing guy who doesn't know if he wants me long-term, or do I find someone who is gaga about me and could really see himself with me? I feel so lost and sad and lonely.



TL;DR; Boyfriend of a year doesn't seem to see / desire a future with me, while I want a future with him. When discussions of future are brought up, he is vague.

11837,Breakups,26f7p6,"Alright, so here's the lowdown of how I got to where I am right now. I hadn't really been in any type of relationship before I started college in 2007. I dated a few girls until I met my Ex in early-2009 [F20]. We started dating a month or so later and it lasted almost a year until she broke up with me in March of 2010. Now, I was a college student who really didn't know how to act in a relationship. Everyone I've talked to has said they've done the same thing at one point or another. Putting friends in front of the GF, not actively trying to spend time with them, etc. I lived in what could probably be considered a frat house at the time and the party scene wasn't really her thing. I never did anything to purposely hurt her, but eventually she met someone else who knew what they were doing and she left. It didn't seem like an easy decision for her, as she was really crazy about me at the beginning, but eventually she made it.

So I didn't take this breakup well, the summer of 2010 was a pretty big mess for me (drinking, sex, etc.) But I still kept in touch with her, making a fool of myself in the process, hoping that she'd change her mind.

In about June of 2010 I decided to cut off all contact at the advice of some family members. So this slope of despair continued until I realized I needed to shape up for school in about October and at this point I was in a place where I thought about her all the time, but I could still function in real life.

I started dating another girl in March of 2011 [F21], this lasted for about a year and half. I had learned from the first one and really did everything a guy was supposed to do. I really liked doing this and even her friends had commented to me that they couldn't believe how much of a good boyfriend I was all the time. I didn't feel like she appreciated it all the time, and I know I really wasn't treated as well as I treated her. It wasn't anything in particular, I just felt she didn't try as hard. In the end, this one needed to end when it did, we were just really different people and even though we did love each other and she was the one that decided to end it, there was just too much of her behavior, drugs, partying, etc that I couldn't deal with (ironic right?). She was still in school when I was finished and had a job. I think the reason why I wasn't upset about this ending is that I did my absolute best in this relationship, I put everything I had into it and it didn't work, there was nothing I could do.

So since then I've dated (exclusively) a few different girls for no longer than 2 or 3 months at a time. I travel a lot for work, so that's part of why they don't last, but I really just find myself getting bored. I like the chase and I like wooing a girl, and I feel I'm really good at it, but after that, I find I enjoy time by myself rather than with them. I'm very quick to find someone else after this, usually a few weeks.

So my problem seems to be that when I'm single, my mind keeps going back to this first girl. For some reason I have put her up on this pedestal that makes her the most absolute perfect match for me. I keep regretting that she didn't get the same me that the other girls got. I feel like it would have lasted if I had known how to act. I find myself Google-ing her occasionally. This has shown me that she's now married to the guy she left me for and more recently, I found out they have a young son. They're both working professionals and seem to be in a great spot in their lives.

I know that I couldn't handle having all of that right now, I'm 25, have a great job and travel all over the world for it, but have trouble taking care of myself sometimes, let alone a kid and a solid relationship.

I'm dating a girl right now [F21], have been for about 3 months. She really likes me, she's met my friends and apparently she's told them this too. Unfortunately, my feeling about the relationship is, well, it's fine for now, which is a terrible way to think. It's been like this for the last year and half of girls, which have also never been over the age of 21.

Basically, I still miss the first girl. I think about her way too much for it ending 4 years ago. In my mind, I eventually want to be married with a family but I still can't see it being with anyone but her.

Sorry for the long winded explanation, but what are your thoughts on all of this Reddit????

Background: We've been dating a a few months. Things have been somewhat rocky over the past few weeks, but overall we communicate well and have a healthy relationship. Except...

He won't cut his ex out of his life. A few weeks ago, I got frustrated because she still contacts him via Facebook and text message. The reason this particular ex bothers me is because all I've ever heard about her is how evil, abusive, manipulative, and horrible she is. They've been broken up for years, but he's said in the past that he's never cared about anyone else like he cared about her and she ruined him. He said that he doesn't really talk to her too much but he keeps her in his life just because. When probed with questions to gain understanding of the situation, I didn't really get anywhere. I just got defensive, short, angry answers. My point was that if he already doesn't talk to her much and he doesn't really care about her friendship, why is she still in his life? (texting randomly and on holidays, liking profile pictures, writing on his wall, etc) We fought about it and he called me insecure and jealous. While I agree that I have some insecurities and some baggage I'm working on from old relationships, this wasn't really a case of insane jealousy as much as wanting to understand the situation. If they were truly friends and she treated him well, I would understand more. We are adults. People date and break up and remain friends. I am acquaintances with some of my ex's. However, the verbally/mentally abusive ones? Fuck no. And if I ever dated someone who had a problem with me talking to one of them? Gone. The only reason I bring that up is because its hard for me to understand how he feels. 

We finally stopped fighting and started communicating. I realized that she's no threat to me. But he promised he wouldn't talk to her, would ignore her if she contacted him, and would restrict her on FB. He made this decision on his own. (I did NOT ask for it) He promised to make the situation better.

Cue to this week. She's still on his Facebook, still liking his pictures. So I ask if she's been restricted. He says no. He hasn't done a damn thing. He said he was going to but didn't. Maybe he changed his mind. Fine. Talk to me about it. Instead I get pissed and say some things I probably shouldn't have said about me being worried that he still cares about her. (I just can't understand why she's still around). He gets pissed and says I'm no longer willing to appease your insecurities by cutting her our of my life. I thought you were fine with me just ignoring her but I guess you don't trust that. I don't know why I should have to anyway. 

So not only did he go back on a promise, he is now going back on everything he said and is being really callous and cold. He didn't even have a chance to ignore her yet... she hasn't contacted him. So he's literally done nothing except spout off a bunch of words to try to appease me until the storm blows over.

We go from having an understanding and mature and healthy conversation, right back into unhealthy fighting. This isn't about jealousy or insecurities. To me it's about trust that when he says he will make a situation better, that he actually will. It's about respect for our relationship. And it's about him caring about my feelings and needs instead of shutting me out and giving me the silent treatment just because he's pissed. He thinks I'm trying to control him by telling him who he can and can't talk to, when really I just want to understand their friendship so I can feel secure. If he still is keeping the door open and holding a candle to her that no future girl will ever compare to, I want to bail. His only reassurance was that this girl is no threat to me because she has a boyfriend... nothing about how HE feels about me, or about how she knows about me or anything. (I don't think she knows about me at all)

I feel like whatever the reason for either one of us being upset, we should be able to communicate and come to a compromise. Anytime I bring up something that upsets me, I feel like he treats it like a battle (even if I am calm and use I statements!!) and he shuts down. The fact that he can't empathize with my feelings (even if he still makes the decision to have her in his life) is more troubling to me than he being around.

She takes one bus to get home and I take two buses including that one to get home.  As I got off the bus I was on with her she started messaging me as usual,  while I waited for the second bus at the bus stop.  

After awhile she stopped replying which is unusual to me so I called her,  she said she was walking and almost home and would call me when she got in.  About a few minutes later she messaged me saying, I'm sorry.. She told me, when I got off the bus,  some guy had gotten on (at the exact same stop I got off) and started talking to her. Making small talk and flirting a bit.  As she went on, (to keep it short) when she got off the bus he got off as well and started following her.  That's was around the time she stopped messaging me and that's when I called her and she had told me she would message me when she was home.  

She said the guy had gotten off the bus because of her and had started flirting with her. To keep it short again,  she told me he had started touching and kissing her.  He was putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her breasts and putting his hand down her shorts to grab her ass and she told me he even kissed her on the lips. She kept telling him that she had to get home repeatedly and he continued to flirt but stopped touching her when she said she had a boyfriend but gave her his number anyways.  He even offered to walk her home to which he refused.

11840,Relationships,1m4hwe,"So, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years. We had about a 6 month break up a year ago, because we thought that I was going to have to move away for work, and we were becoming distant from each other. Turns out, with a little communication we realised that we were both becoming distant because we were so worried about having to do long distance. Then I got a job offer in our home town. So we're now back together.

Recently, I've started to feel that he's becoming my best friend, and nothing more. I've always felt like he's my best friend, but it's never gotten in the way of intimacy. The last time we had sex (about 3 months ago) it got weird. It felt like we were two people having sex in the same room, just not with each other. I spoke to him about it and we've somehow come to the conclusion that I've lost my libido and we just have to wait for that to sort itself out. It's fair. I'm not sexually attracted to anyone else, and I've been going through a fair bit of anxiety lately which messes with that too.

I also recently found out that I couldn't have children, and he's always wanted kids. When I told him about it, he did say that he'd be with me with or without kids, but I can't help but wonder if I'm depriving him of this thing that he has always wanted.

And there's the best friend thing. We can sit and watch Netflix for hours, have a laugh down the pub with our friends, but anything more than a quick good morning kiss when he heads to work is all I can handle. Anything more feels wrong. I don't even get dressed in front of him anymore. 

His birthday is this week, and I just feel horrible for feeling like this. I feel like I should just nip it in the bud and break up with him, but there's something about breaking someone's heart that I do deeply care for... I would do anything for him. I just don't know how to approach any of this, at all.

**tl;dr**: I feel like my relationship with my boyfriend is turning into nothing more than friendship and I don't know how to manage the situation.","Me[23F] with my boyfriend [27M] of four years, I think he's turning into nothing but my best friend.",0.0,False,7.0,6.0,1378841826.0,/r/relationships/comments/1m4hwe/me23f_with_my_boyfriend_27m_of_four_years_i_think/,Romantic
11841,Relationships,1ug7ip,"My boyfriend's constantly been the sort of guy to surround himself with good-looking girls for company. Besides the one good guy friend he has, the rest are all basically girls, ones who will dress up, go to parties, and who are known for being very popular around campus. He also has a best friend who's a very attractive girl, who he's been an intimate friend with for years.

He's spoken about how he pursued certain people's friendships, and, since he entrusts me with a ton of personal information, also how he's pursued certain girls for sex. When he was listing off names of girls he looked forward to befriending and becoming close to, everyone who came up was, surprise, a very attractive girl.

I'm not disturbed so much by their looks; I consider many of my male friends very good-looking, and appreciate other girls aesthetically all the time. It's a very flirtatious atmosphere that surrounds my boyfriend and all his female friends, a sexually charged energy I'd put somewhere close to chemistry. A couple of these girls have boyfriends, others are single, but several will post selfies on facebook that have gotten awkward what a hot couple! comments. They also speak with a lot of kinesthetic aid, touching arms, play-shoving, hair-ruffling, slapping his ass, etc. I'm a little confused on if this is standard behavior from people who are by nature more flirtatious, towards people they only platonically like.

Then there's the intimacy my boyfriend has in all of his friendships, he said...most of which are with these girls. He's very open about what he's done with his friends, including having slept in his best friend's bed, having seen her naked (she changes in front of him), knowing about her sex life, etc. He's also had sexual things with a couple of his current list of female friends, though he's not saying which ones for their privacy. I think I can understand that. He's also a photographer, and asked me very earnestly if I'd be okay with him doing nude shoots with some of these friends. He's also talked about how he could easily sleep with several of them if he made the right moves, albeit in an analytical context.

All of these make me...uncomfortable, to start with. I don't think myself unattractive, but there's definitely a couple of his friends who are objectively better-looking than I am. The rest have very engaging, outgoing, and flirtatious personalities, which is fine, but just not who I am. My boyfriend constantly expresses wonder, affection, and respect for me, and always stops to listen intently to what I have to say. He's been nothing but honest and open with me, and spends lots of time with me as well.

Part of this is definitely me feeling threatened, feeling like these female friends are providing more girlfriend comfort than I'm capable of doing. My boyfriend is a pretty flirtatious type himself, and I feel like since we've been together he's been taking care of me so much already by toning it down, I'm possibly boring him, or tying him down, maybe not even being good enough to look at the whole while.

The other part is the boundaries question. I'm not entirely sure if this is standard behavior, or if I'm just becoming the unfairly territorial girlfriend who doesn't trust her caring albeit universally intimate boyfriend. He's always good to me, but I can't help but wonder if I'm his stability among a sea of preferred, more fun entertainment. He says I know him better than anyone else, but that's because he's been telling me so much he wouldn't tell his female friends. I know I'm emotionally valuable to him, and that's not the issue. I can't tell if-

**TL;DR Boyfriend greatly enjoys flirtatious and intimate friendships with many attractive girls.

11843,Relationships,2uerzo,"So anyways I have a girlfriend (almost 3 months) and I'm really really truely in love with her and I can't even describe how much I love this girl and how much I enjoy and charish every moment we spend together. She is beautiful and smart, great person overall. I honestly have a feeling like I couldn't ever love any other girl like I love this one, and I that I won't find a better girl than this one, and I really mean it. Also we are spending a lot of time together and we talk a lot, basicaly she is my girlfriend and my best friend. And the problem is sometimes I get jealous over really really stupid things, for example some guy comments her picture on fb and adds some hearts to the comment I feel jelaous, or when she is 'fighting' (she kicks him in his back, and then she teases her a bit, and then they show each other tongues,for example) or when her male friend kisses her in a cheek in front of me I get really jealous even tho I don't show it because I don't want her to think about me negatively. I know jealously is a normal thing but I'm like really really afraid that one day she might get fed up of me and find a 'better' replacement, I don't know why I think this way but I really really don't want to lose this girlfriend.

11844,Relationships,2k9049,"I want to preface this by mentioning that my boyfriend has Bipolar II, depression, and PTSD so I know his emotions are often volatile. I also have depression, PTSD, and generalized anxiety so these diagnoses might be a factor in this. 

Pretty much ever since we started dating, I feel that he is always questioning my motives. I feel like he thinks that I'm out to hurt him or sabotage him. He asks things like “why do you torture me?” when I do something he doesn't like, and I don't know it's bothering him until he makes a comment like that. It could be anything, from trying to talk to him about something he did that hurt me or bothered me to watching a video/listening to a song he doesn't like. 

He says things that really hurt my feelings. We moved into a new apartment a few months ago and it isn't in the best condition; it's dirty. I've been in the habit of walking around the house barefoot and I stepped into the kitchen barefoot where we had a spill of dishwater liquid that was contaminated. It resulted in him yelling at me, calling me filthy, and threatened to break up with me if I continued to do that. 

When we lived at our old apartment, he would stay up all night pretty much on the computer and the computer screen was really bright, which was hard for me to sleep when I had to be at work at 8am the next day. When I asked him to turn the screen down, he acted indignant and that it was a big inconvenience for him. When he gets frustrated with something, I try to help him in any way I can, but he accuses me of implying that he's stupid and I feel useless. When he does something that really hurts my feelings and makes me cry, he says I'm being “hysterical.” I cry a lot because of my depression for often non-descript reasons and this frustrates him even more.

We both work at the same place and because of Obamacare, our hours got cut and we can't work more than 25 hours a week. I've been looking for additional sources of income and I have job interviews scheduled, but he hasn't made any effort to look for another job, so I feel like I'm pulling most of the weight for our security. He has had financial problems in the past. He quit his job last January because they were being abusive to him, cheating him out of a lot of his pay, and he worked there for about a year and a half before they paid him above minimum wage. After that, he was unemployed for five months, and I was paying our portion of the rent/bills myself when we lived at our old apartment. I asked him why it was taking so long for him to find another job, and he blamed me because I wasn't helping him with chores around the house (which if it was really getting so bad for him that he couldn't fill out a job application while doing housework, I would have helped, but he didn't communicate that with me.) I've gotten better about helping him with chores but he still doesn't think I do anything to help him

Last summer, my sister was staying with us for a while until she could find a job and a place to live, and he and my sister got in a huge fight because she asked when he would be done cooking dinner when it was 2:00 in the morning because he got off late. He ran into our room saying that he was going to kill her and he was going to threaten her with a sword, so I had to physically restrain him from hurting her. He yelled at me that night because I told him to calm down because he was overreacting, and he accused me of taking her side over his. Apparently she was being really disrespectful to him, which she has a tendency of doing, but like I mentioned before, when he doesn't get his way, he gets really aggressive. He's really selfish and he puts himself before others often.

We started dating a year ago shortly after my previous relationship. We started to have feelings for each other but I felt bad because I was still dating my ex (27 M) at the time, and he put pressure on me to end the relationship. He had no concept of boundaries with me and he was start touching me and kissing me even when I told him to stop, but it felt confusing because I liked it and I wasn't getting that kind of attention from my ex in a while. I found out (from my boyfriend) that my ex was lying to me for months about smoking cigarettes after we broke up. We “officially” started dating because he started telling people that I was his girlfriend, we didn't have a discussion about it or anything. 

We get along really well most of the time, he's very affectionate with me. We have really important, deep conversations about anything. We are both child abuse survivors and we have similar life stories, so that is a form of bonding we have. We are a good team when we want the same things. He encourages me to be more creative. However, when we fight, it gets really scary. I'm scared he will eventually hurt me. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with him a lot of times. Is it worth it for me to stay in this relationship and how can I talk to him about this? Any insight at all is appreciated.

11845,Relationships,23w3wx,"Hi Reddit! Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this or if I make a mistake, this is my first time posting in /r/relationships. So please kind. Also, sorry if this ends up being a novel.


A little background information: My SO (let’s call him P) and I have been dating for 2 years. He is everything I’ve ever wanted in a man. He’s smart, sexy, loving, sweet, sensitive, funny, helpful…you get the picture. Never have I had such a strong emotional connection with someone. These past 2 years have been some of the happiest of my life. Although we do not technically live together, I practically live at his house, and we've recently adopted a dog. We are very committed to each other, and have talked about getting married, kids…the whole 9-yards. I can really see myself being with him for the rest of my life. There is just one problem: my future. 


I am currently still in school and have major plans for myself. I am double majoring in International Business and International Relations. My future goals include a lot of world traveling. This fall I will be studying abroad for a semester and am still undecided if I will spend the next semester somewhere else. Basically, I’m not sure if I will be gone for a year or not. After I get out of school, I intend to devote at least a year to a humanitarian cause abroad. I feel very strongly about my ambitions.


That’s the problem. P is very needy. He constantly needs to be shown affection on an emotional and physical level. I have absolutely no problem with this, and I actually really like that part of him. He gives out just as much as he takes, and is is very loving towards me. Plus I like being needed. But I am sure you guys can see the issue…


P is not thrilled that I am going abroad. I can tell he is very worried and stressed about the situation, and I have just recently told him about wanting to continue my exchange past fall semester. He can handle the 5 months apart, but I don’t know if he could manage an entire year. Plus, having been an exchange student before, I know a lot can change in a year. To make matters worse, the first country I am going to has very restricted media access…so I will not be able to keep in contact constantly. Unfortunately, he will probably never be able to afford to visit me and is not interested in most of the countries I want/will to travel to. However, I have a strong feeling that if we are to get through my first year gone, we will make it through everything. P and I have agreed that if we can survive my exchange, we will move into together as soon as I get home. But the traveling will not stop there.


This is not something I am willing to give up. Traveling for extended periods of time is something I want to do for the rest of my life. Yet we are so happy, and I do not want to lose this. I do not want to break up. We have invested so much time and effort into each other…but I am also unwilling to give up on my dreams. I don’t think he would ever try to force me to choose, but if it came down to it I would pick my future. But then that leaves another problem: our dog…but I won’t get into this now. 


The only plans we have right now is to just see how the first semester goes. Also, I’ve had trouble getting him to sit down and directly talk about my plans/ambitions. He tends to always want to avoid the subject, or we start talking and both end up in tears. We have not fully agreed on boundaries or on what to do.


What do I do Reddit? Have any of you experience this before? Any suggestions? Advice?

**tl;dr**: I am studying abroad and my future involves a lot of traveling. My SO and I have been in a relationship for 2 years. He is perfect, but extremely needy (which I like). I don't know if we can survive. I feel like I am choosing between my future or my love life. What do I do?

11846,Relationships,1rptxx,"Ok so I know posts like these come up every second, but I really could need some advice on my personal situation:
We have been together for almost a year now and actually, everything is going fine, besides this problem I don't have a solution for. I've never been an overly jealous girlfriend, e.g. I am total okay with him consuming porn and telling me about it or looking after other girls on the street, even if he's with me.
However, he started telling me which girls he wants to fuck all the time (he even says that about some of my friends) and that he will always want to fuck other girls besides me. I know that this is normal for you guys and I kind of made my peace with it, but it's getting worse. 

He won't stop sending me pictures of girls which are the type he likes (I'm not really like them) and he subtly suggests to get the same haircut as them etc.
Additionally, I'm the first girl he had sex with and he says that the thought of wanting to be with me but not being able to sleep with others depresses him and ruins his thought of future. I don't know how to handle the situation because at the moment, I know I just couldn't cope with him sleeping with others, telling them they are beautiful, kissing them etc. It's just a heartbreaking idea for me and I know it would ruin our relationship instantly. He says he won't cheat on me without having my permission and I trust him. But he says jealousy is something useless and I should set it aside. Ha, how should I do that.

Nevertheless, he won't stop making provocative remarks about it to get me thinking if I wouldn't want an open relationship, too. We always start fighting about it and it makes me feel physically sick. 
If I tell him how I feel, he gets angry about not being able to talk to me about his feelings without me getting mad/depressed. I cannot lie and he also doesn't want me to accept something I'm not really okay with just to make him happy, e.g. having a threesome with another girl. Even if I *was* okay with him fucking other girls, he wouldn't want an open relationship, if I don't use it, too. That's another thing: I just don't want to sleep with other men. But I can't tell him that either because he will complain that this would mean I don't like sex (which is complete bullshit; I love it. I just don't want to fuck strangers).
So yeah, I'm kind of clueless how to handle this.
What's even worse is that it makes me not wanting to see him and that frightens me. A few times I've even almost said that he should go find another girl which wants an open relationship for I don't see any other solution. 
Is really every guy like this? And does anybody have an idea how I could get along with all that? Maybe how I could bring myself to be okay with opening the relationship. Or at least how I could react properly in those situations when he confronts me with that topic again and I am too hurt to answer rationally. 
I would be pleased about every answer, thank you. 

TL;DR: Bf wants an open relationship, I don't. He won't stop discussing about that being so hard for him and puts me under pressure so he can eventually get what he wants. Any ideas how I could handle it?


**Update:** Had another long discussion about it yesterday. He explained that he never meant to push me on anything and that he didn't notice his remarks being pressing or wrecking my self esteem. He says that it's his first relationship and so he doesn't have any experience on what could hurt me, for I always act like I can handle it and then be subtly mad at him for a day before we talk about it. So he wants me to say instantly if anything is hurting my feelings or making me jealous so he can learn what's okay and what isn't. 
This I want to fuck other girls thing apparently is an inner conflict of him that he likes to talk about just to get it out of his head, but he says he's willing to live with that conflict because he loves me and wants to be with me. I think a huge problem here is that he doesn't talk to others about relationship stuff and that talking to me about things you normally discuss with friends doesn't always work out because I am simply involved in them. He says that others will never know the whole situation and if he found this thread by accident he'd probably laugh his ass of for he always says Reddit people can't say anything else except for 'dump him'. They just know one side of the coin.
So yeah, maybe this talk yesterday helped a little. Nevertheless I feel weirdly empty today, though we had a wonderful night after we reconciled yesterday.
I'll probably get comments about me being terribly naive and blind but as long as everything's so beautiful when I'm with him, I'll give it another try and see how things work out. If it won't stop destroying me, I can still end it all. Thanks for your advices!

TL;DR: Had a discussion yesterday. Bf says he didn't mean to push me on anything and that he just wants to talk about things that bother him, but he's willing to keep that conflict for the sake of our relationship. He wants me to say right away if something's hurtful for me so he can stop what he's doing. Don't know how I feel about everything, but I'll give it a last try. Don't hate.

11847,Relationships,1t656e,"A little info about us: We met on OKCupid and hit it off right away.  When I first met him I had just recovered from a restrictive eating disorder which made me take my body to the limit exercise-wise and put a lot of damaging stress on it.  I also was born with a physical disability that affects my legs/lower body and so walk around with crutches.  This combination of disorder and disability made me do certain physical tasks that weren't optimal for my safety or health.  On the other hand, he is a very healthy and capable young man.  He is extremely kind and considerate to everyone, and the best boyfriend I have ever had.  I have never been so in love with someone, and I know he loves me a lot too.

The issue at hand: We live in an area where there is periodically a lot of snow.  Yesterday was one such instance; we had a very large amount of snow piling up quickly and furiously on the roads.  Unfortunately, he had already arranged plans for us to have dinner with his friend.  I was hesitant about going out into the snow but did not want to be rude and cancel the dinner last minute.  The reason I was uncomfortable with just having the two of them meet up while I stayed home was that it would be a one-on-one dinner and the friend was a girl he had been interested in and asked out before he met me... I believed such a situation would be inappropriate and also anxiety-provoking for me.

While he and his friend were physically able and close enough to walk to the restaurant, it is very dangerous and actually impossible for me to do so from where I was (couple miles away). So I took a cab from my place to the restaurant.  I underestimated the intensity of the weather, because a trip that typically would have taken 20 minutes at most ended up taking one hour and twenty minutes, racking up a $101 fare.  On the ride, I felt quite frustrated.  Although he didn't know about the weather before since neither of us checked the forecast that day, by the time I boarded the cab, my boyfriend would have known  the severity of the weather and state of the roads, since he would have walked from his workplace to his apartment (a short distance, but not so short it is only a block or two away).  So I was quite surprised he was ok with me driving outside, when last year during similar weather, he didn't want to order food because he was concerned about the safety of the **delivery man**.  How could he be so concerned about the safety of a stranger and so lackadaisical about his own girlfriend's, I thought?  Even my cab driver couldn't stop talking about how dangerous and difficult the roads were yesterday evening and honestly he shouldn't be doing the job on a day like that.

At this point you may think, well, why did no one call his friend and let her know it would be difficult for the plans to transpire? This is where I can sympathize with my boyfriend's dilemma in this situation.  Her phone was broken and she could only communicate via Wi-Fi which the restaurant didn't have.  It would be rude to not go because she had walked 20 min from her apartment to the restaurant to meet us.  He could not have dinner alone with her because that would make me uncomfortable.  While I thought if it got bad enough we could call the restaurant and ask them to let the friend know we could not make it, it was an absolute last resort in my mind.  Plus, during the conversation between my boyfriend and I later that night after dinner, I learned he never even thought about being able to do that-- he said, 'Crap, I didn't even think about that,' and it was clear he was beating himself up over it. So to my boyfriend, at the time, the best option would have been for me to make the remainder of the trip (~30min) and have dinner with them.

This is logical but I am bothered by it because it made me feel as if my comfort and safety was not as important to him as others'.  In this instance, whether it was actually the case or not, it felt like he put her convenience before my safety (and finances...a**$101 **fare!!). As I said earlier, he is an extremely considerate man who is constantly thinking of everyone's needs.  This is attractive, except sometimes it is not so good when in a relationship with a disabled person.  While I am used to my needs being put so far ahead of others' in plan-making when with my family or friends, my boyfriend weighs out everyone's wants/needs, only seeming to place a little more weight on mine than others'. This makes it so sometimes I have to push myself much harder or I have a more difficult time in order to meet everyone else's wants.  I feel guilty and actually inferior when this happens, and I don't want to be a party pooper/ruiner so I push myself anyways.   A couple of these instances have happened in our relationship before.  I will usually let him know that night when we get home how I felt, that it was hard for me, and how it could have been more comfortable for me afterwards, but admittedly not always because it is very emotionally taxing to have to say, I can't do this thing everyone else has no problem with, so everyone else has to change what they were gonna do just because of me.  I am not used to having to do that, because as I said, my friends and family consider me so heavily that the issue never even comes up.  People usually *under*estimate my abilities, while my boyfriend seems to *over*estimate them.  So it is new to me and very hard at times. It is also very uncomfortable and guilt-provoking for him when he can't fulfil what everyone wants (another reason I really don't like letting him know, hey, I can't do that), and I feel having a girlfriend with so many limitations will force him to feel that way more than he would with an able-bodied girl....And that makes me feel awful.

To the point-
I'm worried about this pattern of him making me less comfortable to make others more comfortable.  I do that a lot myself because I don't want to put a damper on anyone's night, but I expect my significant other to consider me more, like my friends and family do.  I know it is partially my fault because when we first started going out, I was still pushing myself beyond my limits due to the eating disorder-- now I have learned it is ok to have comfort levels and limitations, and it is ok to be assertive about them-- and he didn't realize my physical feats back then were unhealthy exceptions, not the rule.  Yet I have also brought this issue up many times before in similar situations, and yesterday was probably the most hurtful because it was not only my comfort at risk, it was my whole safety as well as my driver's.

**The question/TL;DR:**
How do I grapple with these feelings and figure out how to handle these issues in the future? My boyfriend and I had a very lengthy discussion last night where he apologized and we both cried, but I am still worried and sad about this issue.  We are very serious about each other, want to marry someday, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life constantly having to remind someone I can't do this, I can't do that when in other relationships/friendships newer than this, I never have to because people are very careful to be considerate of my needs.","Me, Disabled [21F] Him, [25M], 1 year together - Hurt about him forgetting about my needs/comfort due to being so worried about inconveniencing others, but it is a little more complicated...please help!",0.0,False,0.0,3.0,1387378704.0,/r/relationships/comments/1t656e/me_disabled_21f_him_25m_1_year_together_hurt/,Romantic

I had been dating my ex bf for 3 and a half years before I broke up with him just two months ago. To set the scene, I feel as though my sex drive surpasses the majority of men, especially when I completely love someone. In the beginning, I would want to share that 'closeness' with my ex all the time, and multiple times in a night. I haven't been with many people which actually surprises a lot of people I know, but he has been with even less. As a result of this he wasnt the most confident person when it came to sex, and would often take offence to me asking to go again.. thinking I didn't enjoy the first time (I didn't know this was a confidence issue until 2 years later). I'd never heard this from anyone before. I guess over time (the first year and a bit) I built up this image of him in my mind which was not attractive. The complete opposite of the pick you up and do you against the wall out of nowhere kind. As a result, the relationship completely switched around. Eventually I stopped finding him sexually attractive even though I thought he was great looking. My sex drive completely shut down. For the past year he has been wanting sex ALL the time but I lost all urges. On special occasions I would force myself just because I felt it was the right thing to do.. of course to him I made out like it was complete pleasure so he never knew.

Don't get me wrong, every other aspect of our relationship was perfect. He truly was my best friend and I miss him every day. He really is an incredible guy, and I consider myself lucky that he even wanted to fix things after the following point.

Of course everyone will always reach a breaking point. It was the hardest decision of my life. I love him but I'm not sexually attracted to him.. I had to end it as it wasn't fair on either of us. He was starting to have some serious doubts about himself and I was wondering if I generally just didn't like sex anymore - thoughts I would never usually have. 

A few weeks ago I slept with someone from my past. My doubts about whether or not I just didn't enjoy sex anymore were cured! All my excitement came rushing back and I knew it wasn't a permanent problem for me.

The issue is that I still love my ex. With all my heart. We spoke recently about getting back together and I told him that I'd been with someone else. He says I don't love him because if I did I couldn't do that to him. I can definitely see where he's coming from but I don't feel that is true. I would get back with him in the blink of an eye if I knew sex would be great again. Nevertheless he still agreed to try and work things out.

What should I do? has anyone felt a similar way and what happened? I'm in tears because I miss him to the core - but I don't know if I can be sexually attracted to him again.. I feel like I'm letting the best guy in the world walk out of my life.. :(

During an operation I was observing, a nurse came up to me and told me that if I was looking for a future partner he's the man to go for - I had noticed him and wondered so that was just further affirmation.

11852,Relationships,29a1bo,"This honestly hurts to type out but here it goes:

So last night my GF told me about how she used to be extremely insecure about herself and became friends with these guys online who would constantly harass her for nudes and pics of herself. She said at the time she was very clueless and gullible so she used to think of them as her 'best friends.' Well one day they got her to isntall some screensharing program where they were able to look through her computer and download all the pictures (and one video) she had taken of herself. Some pictures (and the video) were nudes that were underage at the time. 

Backstory: This was all brought up when she realized she was still following him on social media and I said to simply unfollow him not knowing the backstory to it all. She then said he would probably harass her and leak all of her nudes online and to her friends/family if she ever unfollowed him since he had been previously abusive throughout their 'friendship'.

 I said this would be a good opportunity to bring a case against him if he did try anything since she knows most of his popular usernames and his first name. We coulld easily screenshot the messages, maybe even bait him into screenshoting the folder of her nudes for blackmail, then bring it to police and she said no. So that's where things got complicated.

I don't want to write a wall of text so I'll summarize this last part then give a tl:dr of it all. 

She said that is happened too long ago and not to worry about it anymore since the backlash from her family/friends would be too much of her and everyone would think less of her if they found out she had nudes online. I was really pushing for a case against the creep but she denied saying to let it go and we haven't exactly spoken since last night. So I've been staying up since I can't sleep troving every single archive/amateur website I can find while reverse image searching everything to see if i can even find a wiff of it some where on the net. I just can't sleep knowing some where out there on megaupload or the likes is something called (hername).zip with all of her underage nudes and video. And I'm not some internet veteran or anything but if you spend a couple of months on /b/ and other forums like it you know how these people are. You know they didn't just stop at her, they're probably harassing and blackmailing hundreds of other underage women into doing the same thing she did. These aren't some 1337 hackers either, they're just some loser teenagers who got a gullibe girl to install a Desktop sharing program. And that's the part I can't stop thinking about. She knows so much about this dude yet she's sitting on the knowledge on it and not taking action.

Am I taking this too far?

A week ago I drunkenly made out with a classmate on a Friday night out. I had only briefly talked to her before, she wanted to go back to hers but I really wasn't into it due to a lot of personal/cultural/religious reasons so basically after close to 30 mins of kissing and a lot of groping she drags me back to hers and wants to do it, I decline and say I would much rather that we take it slow if she wants that, the next day we talk on Facebook and I end up at hers just chilling with her flatmates, nothing happens and its was a good night. 

Then the next day she asks me over again but this time we are alone, me being the inexperienced one in this situation don't really pick up on the ques and I leave after a quick light kissing session at her door. 

Fast forward a week, we are both busy with university so we don't hang out much, just talk on Facebook and a quick chat in between lectures. During this time one of my friends tells me that this girl has a bit of a complicated situation, she made out with another guy on the same course as us the night before and a few hours before we met up on Friday and she apparently has a crush on this guy as well, she also has been in a fuck buddy situation with another guy on our course for the last few months.

Now when I heard this I felt like quite the idiot because I thought she was somewhat exclusively into me but now I just feel like she just thought eh FirstTimeEverthings will do and went with it, Due to a variety of reasons this would be my first relationship ever and along with that, the Friday night was my first actual sexually intense encounter, so this afternoon she asks if I want to come over to watch a movie, when I decline because I have 7am starts this entire week she asks if I want to come over this Friday for drinks with her flatmate, I said I needed to check if I'm free and left it at that. What should I do?

11854,Relationships,1jgico,"So I love this girl that i've been with for about a year now but I'm moving away for school for a year and so we're doing the long distance relationship thing. However, we've had some trust issues that involve her having gotten back with her ex (who admittedly-and regrettably- she was with when we got together) and me finding out. I decided to stick with her because I love her and I know she was acting in fear (they were together a long time and lived together and all that jazz, enough to make a break up a very serious and intimidating thing)— which while not making what she did ok, identifies it for me as something that we can work on. 

So we've been doing better but honestly I'm worried about moving away. I dont think she'd get back with him, but they do have a friend group in common, a friend group that I havent really met, and that intimidates me. She told me she needed time before introducing me to them because they all know about her and I being one of the causes of the dissolution of her last relationship. The last time she told me that (as I would ask about meeting her friends cause it was something that I felt would make me feel more secure in our relationship, for whatever reason) she kind of got pissed at me, so I dropped it and havent really brought it up since. 

I dont know, I guess I'm asking what's some ways you people do long distance relationships?

11856,Relationships,2bn1mv,"So to open up, my girlfriend told me she had a crush on one of our friends before we got together (a few weeks before), one that I introduced her to. She told me that she had this crush while we were getting together and before our first date. I asked her if she had any feelings for him and she said she didn't but I can't ignore my gut instinct to ask. She describes a crush as someone she sees often and is physically attractive.

I want to believe her but I've had past trust issues due to other relationships.

This happened a few months ago but it came across my mind a few days ago, so I decided to ask her again and it seems every time I ask  her, she adds more things to the story.

Basically, we were just chilling and said past crush walks by and one side of his hair is sticking up in a weird direction, instead of telling him to fix it, she stands up and walks over and fixes it for him. Now I tend to notice things people do, and I've caught said crush looking at my GF from behind in a obvious attracted look a few times when I brought it up to her, she just laughed and said why didn't I tell her sooner. So I thought something was going on.

When I asked her today, she said she thought that his interview (we all work in the same place) was that day. Something she has never said when I asked her about that.

I asked her if fixing people's hair was something she always does (we hang around a lot of friends most of the day), she said is but she can't give me any examples of it and I've never seen her do it to anyone but that one time.

I honestly don't know how to feel about the issue, I have always been a jealous person, and I tend to over analyst things.

11862,Relationships,278cqn,"We started dating 11 mos ago, after meeting through a mutual friend. Our relationship is great - we get along so well, have tons of fun together, see each other several days every week and our friend groups have blended and there are lots of social activities we do together, as well as regular dates with just the 2 of us. We both come from solid families, who we are close with. We haven't met eachother's parents yet - his live overseas (where he's from) mine live far away too. He's going to be meeting mine in just a few weeks though, they are coming to visit.

I'm just not sure that he really thinks about a future with me. We don't really talk about the relationship itself - Like what we want, how we feel it's going, etc - and I think this is bc it's just been SO easy being together, thus far. There's no need to analyze something that's working well, right? 

But now I'm starting to feel uncertain bc I've just turned 30 and realize that dating for the fun of it isn't really a luxury I can afford right now. We talked a bit about moving in together in April, and he said he wasn't ready yet - so we've postponed that MAYBE till the fall, depending on where things are at. We haven't said 'I love you' yet - though I do feel it for him, not sure if he does for me.

He doesn't seem that interested in me getting to know his family - I've chatted to them once on skype for a few mins.. He seems to be into the idea of us visiting his homeland in the next 6 months or so, but I was the one who suggested it, and he was just sort of like - sure, I guess that would work.

I guess I'm just caught between talking about where he sees this going and on what timeline, and not wanting to 'rock the boat' so to speak. I just need some assurance that I'm not wasting my time dating someone who's gonna decide they're not ready to marry for another 5+ years - but I don't know if you can really ask someone that without pressuring them into committing.

11863,Relationships,26xwql,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months, but recently we've been talking a lot about breaking up.

We're both graduating high school this year, and will be attending different colleges next fall. The idea of being in a long distance relationship never concerned me because we'll still be in the same state, less than 6 hours away from each other. This didn't seem to bug her either. But within the last week she's said that she thinks that she wants to break up for college because she wants to experience what adulthood by herself is like. Her parents are very strict and she's never really been independent.

I'm all for her being independent, and as a good friend I want her to make whatever decision will be best for her. The problem is she wants to wait until the end of summer. She says there are still things she wants to do together, and she doesn't want to lose this time we could share. But for me, if we're going to break up definitely I don't see what the point in staying together is. I don't get why I would put that effort into building a romantic relationship when I know it won't last. The thing is she makes me so incredibly happy. I tend to be a loner and prefer time by myself, but that changed when we started dating. I love spending time with her and she has helped me keep a more upbeat perspective in life. I know it was ignorant of me to think, because we're both still in highschool, but I honestly saw me sharing the future with her, something I've never really done with any past relationships. I don't see how I could date anyone else after her, and I can't imagine loving anyone as much as I love her. 

So right now I have to decide if I want to end it now, or stay together for these few months. I know I'll enjoy the summer more with her, but this will always be in the back of my head. I also know that staying together will get my hopes up, that maybe she'll change her mind. I know that I'll probably be even more torn up by the end of summer if we stay together, and I don't think that's fair to my future self.

She is going to grad school upon graduation for 2 years and I will hopefully have a job and will live with her and support her through grad school (with help from our parents when necessary). 

It is her belief that we should get married during the summer after our graduation because it is when we will both have enough time to plan/have a wedding and then have a sufficient honeymoon. 

It is of my opinion that we should wait roughly a year or so after we live together and I have my job (hopefully) and she is in grad school so that we have experienced living together and dealing with finances and things of that nature. 

I understand her position that it would definitely be easiest to find time for wedding/honeymoon/etc during that summer grace period, but I feel as if we need to experience being off on our own and dealing with adult issues before we undertake marriage, even though it will be more difficult to find time to do a wedding.

11866,Dating,23bysh,"Okay, fairly new reddit user here, but I have been trying to seek help via the internet for this problem for years, because I'm too afraid of telling anyone in real life that could actually help me, but I believe in the integrity of the reddit community, so here goes. This may be quite long, but please read it through.

Let's start 5th grade. Still rollin' through with easy A's, so more focus on the social aspects of life is acceptable. This was when all the friend groups formed, (sporty kids, geeky kids, ghetto kids, popular kids, etc.) and I wasn't doing to well finding one for myself. I was weird. I'll admit now, because I'm sociable now. There was this girl, and her friend, and they treated me and my best friend like dirt for the entirety of 5th grade. They may have had reason for such, as my friend and I used to pretend to be mythical beings, and I mean avidly pretend. Like, not ever break character. I was a vampire, he was a werewolf. I know, that's really strange, but don't worry, I'm not like that at all anymore. Anyway, one of these girls actually sort of believed us, and she was the more quiet one, so I took a liking to her.

6th grade. Now, neither of us ever admitted to our year-long fib. We expected it to just fade away, and were too embarrassed to ever let it surface again. So that was over, and I was ready to start a social life. However, there was a serious problem. All the friend groups had already been occupied and acquainted, so tightly that there was no chance of moving. No social mobility, comparable to a sort of caste system. I was stuck, which did not help the fact that I had slowly fallen head over heels for this girl in 5th grade that had bullied me, a girl who had joined the sporty soccer caste. She clearly had no intention of getting to know me, but I brainstormed, and decided to wait it out until the awkwardness from the previous year had faded away.

7th grade. Still no hope of connection, just watching hopelessly from my corner in the bottom castes, hanging with my fellow social outcasts, who preferred longboarding and playing video games to sports, and all were tightly isolated from the higher castes. This did not help my case, and I was losing hope, but kept on strong. I was in her math (accelerated) class, so I was forced to be reminded every day of my struggle. I suppose people noticed my nervous glances at her every so often, and reported to her, because one fateful day that year in early spring, she got up from her seat after class when everyone was gone and I was struggling with my books, (organizational issues, we all had them, I still do) turned to me, and frankly said I don't like you, turned, and walked away. I was devastated. I had a hunch, but wasn't faced so obviously or abruptly with it before. This affected my relationships and grades permanently. It did not end my issues, but amplified them indefinitely.

8th grade. Quite a simple year. Same friends, worse grades, lower self-confidence. I kept brainstorming what I could possibly do. Then it came to the near end of the year, and I met one of her close friends through my best friend (same guy as 5th) and she quickly became a close friend of mine. I told her everything, and she tried to help, but she really had her own embedded issues with organizing dates and events, and was still treated a bit childishly by her parents. I felt a bit sorry. The year ended with still no resolve.

9th grade. This new friend of mine, despite failed help most of 8th grade did, however, find out for me that my longtime crush did not, in fact, hate me, like I had assumed that year. This left in my mind a possibility of a friendship with this elusive mistress. I was delighted, impatient and anxious to explain it all to her in hopes of mutual understanding, but when it came to a meeting at last, I blew it. I said nothing for the whole hour we had. I hate myself for this, I seem to do it every time. I'm just so terrified of this girl.

I need help. Badly. I can't even bring myself to tell my therapist this. If there are any girls out there reading this, I would greatly appreciated a reply via comment. Thank you for your time.

Dates a girl for two months in early 2012, we'll call her stupidface, and abruptly breaks up with her due the fact that he couldn't yet have a normal relationship due to his father. Year and a half later (early june 2013) him and his whole family move 8 hours away due to fathers employment. NEVER, EVER, talks about his problems. Always tries to be tough and insist that nothing is wrong. Literally he has never acted sad or had a bad day in front of me.

-me: Psychologically fucked up for the past year. Been through secondary diseases such as hardcore depression, eat disorders, suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Finally figured out the primary problem (ADHD) and am finally getting my life back on track. And then...

June 2013. I have a mental breakdown and try to break up with him because of him moving away shortly. During this fight, we were both heartbroken. We made up the next morning, but things were still shaky. That following night, his friends threw him a going away party.

What I was told and thought happened: Went to party. Went to lunch the next day with crazy face because they're friends. Halfway through summer he tells me (doesn't ask me) that he's going to his old school's prom with crazy face. I say err, that hurts, can you go with anyone else? He makes me believe that I was the wrong one to try to control him. Okay. Two weeks later I text him telling him that I'm still hurt that he's so fixated to go to prom with this girl. Then, my life stopped.

What actually happened: Flirted immensely with stupidface and kissed her at the end of the night at his party. Went out to lunch with her the next day to discuss how neither of them ever had closure when their relationship abruptly ended. Ever since, the kiss, he said he had feelings for her. (This is the part I don't understand) Not feelings that he wants to date her, just feelings that were left over. Still refuses to not go to prom with her because he insists that that'll be closure for him (I don't fucking know). I tried to make him choose between me and her but he REFUSES to. He keeps saying they're just friends..but has the leftover feelings (what the fuck).

He says he knew he fucked up. He's sorry. He didn't tell me about any of this because he was trying to protect me. He loved(s) me the whole time and hates himself for what he did. I still don't understand the feelings things, because he says they're there, but they're insignificant and he want(ed) to keep still be with me.

As you can imagine, I exploded. I haven't eaten and barely slept since friday (when this fight started). I am hurt, more hurt than 6 months of depression has ever prepared me for. I need you guys to understand though that this boy is my soul mate. Now that I'm sightly calmed down, and I only now realize that this whole time he's been more psychologically fucked than I've been. I realize he didn't mean to kiss stupidface and he was just confused. It hurts like hell, but I'm willing to work past it because he needs someone. He's broken and he would never admit it and now it came to bite him in the ass so hard.

I said a lot of really mean things to him. A lot. Really Mean. I'm a bitch. Now, he doesn't know what he wants. He's really hurt by my words and needs time to think. Okay.

Guys, please understand that I am not ready to walk out on him. This is my soul mate. I'll never be willing to walk out on him. I will do anything to fix this. I understand it might take a while. At the same time, I can't hurt anymore. I don't know what to do. I had to skip school today because I didn't want to start being known as the depressed girl again. This boy never gave up on me, even when I was standing in my kitchen with a bottle of pills in my hand. I just can't walk away from this, no matter how deep into shit we are. I know he's hurt me, but he needs me. Not only me, I think he needs a therapist.

I came to you reddit because hopefully you're unbiased. I need help and my friends advice of dump his ass is immature and getting me nowhere. We agreed to not talk for a week, so next monday. I even shut my phone off and gave it to my mom to avoid temptation. Please, just help me. I can't fall into depression again. I can't.

11871,Relationships,36uub1,"I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 years now and for the longest time we have been talking about going away together. A combination of school, work and other real life circumstances has always prevented this.

Recently, I found a fantastic deal, one that would save thousands of dollars on this vacation. I have regularly checked for deals to this destination for the past 7 years of my life, this is the best I've ever seen. The dates were perfect too. I eagerly told her and she stone-cold said no. She did not want to leave the city and go on vacation given the circumstances.

Right now, due to an economic downturn in the area, she has recently become unemployed and won't be employed in the forseeable future as she finishes her degree.

However, I don't think that money is an issue. I am a graduate student currently making about $60K per year from a combination of funding and working (a lot) on the side. I currently have about $230K in savings, $17k in a chequing and an additional $7.5K in a separate, special, savings account ear-marked for nothing else except this vacation. I started saving for this since about a month after we started dating. Neither of us have any other significant assets. Neither of us have any debt.

The vacation dates correspond to just after I finish my thesis defense, after she finishes her last courses, we arrive home before convocation, before I start a full time job and the exchange rate is getting close to the best it has been in about 5 years.

Am I crazy? Isn't the timing about as perfect as it gets? I can't get a reason out of her why she won't come with me other than money.

This vacation means a lot to me. I come from a fairly broken home, I have no siblings and noone I consider family other than her. I have never went on a family vacation (or any vacation). I was jobless, with a grade 8 education and no money when I was 20. I feel like I largely wasted my teens and early 20s and being 29 now. I feel like I will never be able to get an opportunity like this to go on vacation while I am still somewhat young. She is very well aware of all of this.

After I start my job, my ability to go on an extended vacation will be limited. I have worked very hard and deprived myself of many hours of sleep to get to this point and I can't help but be extremely disappointed.

Going on my own is not an option. She would be okay with it but I would only be able to think of what could have been. It could not do anything except possibly put an unnecessary strain on our relationship.

I have sat for a very long time trying to rationalize her point of view. The only thing I can come up with is that due to her unemployment, she is unwilling to go on vacation if she didn't earn at least some portion of the funds.

The only other case I can dream of is that she would rather prepare saving for a wedding, home, or perhaps children (I have stated repeatedly over the years that I have no interest in children).

Am I being unreasonable? I had recently read on TIFU about a guy who overspent on his prom date who wouldn't spend time with him at the prom and the comments at the time were seemingly in resounding favor of his prom date. Because he couldn't seem to understand his dates feelings.



Based on the previous paragraph, and rereading everything else I wrote. I suspect that I may be a narcissist and that I am simply unwilling to consider her feelings. I fully acknowledge that the tone of this post is very much centered around me. I can't help it. They offer free psychiatric help at my university and this has rattled me enough to consider booking an appointment so I can work through this.



I also fully acknowledge how stupid and creepy it must be to get the idea to secretly save so soon after we started dating. It sounded like a romantic and good idea until it backfires.


How do I rationalize this? No matter how much I think through everything. No matter how much I try to recognize that she is her own person, it doesn't outweigh all the memories of sleepless nights working to reach this goal.

11872,Dating,330y81,"This all started about 6-7 weeks ago with a girl I met in one of my classes. We're both in the same team for a research project that ends in about 4 weeks so we have to deal with each others no matter what happened. She'd been out of a bad relationship for roughly a month or two while I'd been single for a year and a half after a relationship that lasted slightly over a year and a breakup that hit me really hard.

We started talking to each others roughly a month into the research project and instantly got along VERY well. We had an unfathomable amount of things in common and quickly built a connection the likes of which I'd never had or seen before. Needless to say, we quickly (too quickly, even) fell in love with each others and started what was for all intents and purposes a relationship even though it wasn't official.

We were both happy with that for the time being and it worked very well that way. After some time, I thought we might as well start officially dating but she didn't feel ready yet and wanted to be able to feel free regarding her college applications (both of us trying to get into med school). Without realising it, I put her under more pressure than she could bear and she got refused early into her application process whereas I was offered interviews and all which led to increased tensions inside our relationship. It wasn't really jealousy, but more akin to me feeling bad about not being refused whereas she was because I feel like she deserved it a lot more than me. Add to that the fact that I was pressuring her into committing a little more and needless to say, things ended up collapsing, hard.

Recently, I could see that it wasn't working that well but couldn't accept it and things didn't change. At that point, she proposed a break but telling me that she still loved me and felt that we'd definitely end up together but that it had to wait for school to end and for the summer to start. 

I had never been dumped and somewhat freaked out. I suddenly entered a state of deep denial and couldn't accept it. I initially wanted to end it all there until she felt ready and cut off all contacts but I eventually agreed to remain friends until the conditions became more suitable.

The problem is that before agreeing with her, I said things that I now regret and that hurt her very much. We're not talking about full blown insults but small comments during the fight that were uncalled for and definitely mean. This led to her now being scared of me because she feels that I overreacted and now she's afraid of my future reactions should problems arise and she's also afraid that I will continue hurting her like I did during this fight.

Because of her fears, she went from seeing tons of hopes for the two of us to now seeing next to none and doubting that we'll ever be together. We're still talking in a relatively normal way but her best friend (who also is my friend) has told me that she feels very happy being alone, at least for the time being. Things were really bad but I apologised for my wrong doings and we somewhat reconciled. We used to literally be talking all the time and now barely.

I genuinely feel extremly bad for being so blind to her feelings and pushing her despite the fact that she was not ready and repeatedly told me. This whole thing went very fast (definitely too fast) and the inevitable happened. I also feel very guilty for hurting her. Currently, I feel like shit and I am busy hoping I can go back in time and undo all my wrong doings.

Basically, what I'm looking for is advice on how to get her trust back (I want her to believe that I will not hurt her anymore nor will I pressure her again) and make her understand that my reaction was not a normal one for me. I, myself, cannot even understand what happened to me. I want to start over on new foundations and do things the right way this time but I'm afraid that we blew our only chance at working things out.

For the time being, anything close to being romantical is out of the equation as she wants to be alone for at least the rest of the semester (ends at the end of may) and feels good that way. What can I do to make her stop being afraid of my reactions and the fact that I might hurt her again (which I swear on god won't happen again)?


**TL;DR**: I pressured her which led to her suggesting that we take a break until she's ready to be in a relationship. I freaked out and got into denial and hurt her (psychologically) during the fight.

She's unemployed and I'm currently supporting her financially. Due to her not studying and not being able to get a job, she's been sitting at home almost all day long waiting for me to get back. I really enjoy spending time with her and, all in all, I don't really mind being there for her in my spare time, at least while she gets through this unemployment phase.

She's new to town, has no friends here, no job, no money (I can barely support myself, now that I'm supporting her too, I can barely afford rent/food/bills). She's got nothing to do but updating resumes and emailing them all day long.

When something unexpected happens and I need to get away for a while, she goes nuts. I sort of understand her frustration - she's seriously alone right now, and I'm all she's got. This last weekend my brother went through surgery and I had to accompany him in the hospital. She didn't yell at me, but she got all upset and cried a lot when I told her I'd leave her alone for the weekend (doc said only 1 family member could accompany him, so she couldn't come with me). 

She felt so upset her weekend was 'ruined', she barely ate and didn't get out of bed.

She's really happy when she's with me and knowing I'll be home soon gives her strengh to go through her day and keep emailing resumes. She's got some interviews, but didn't hear back from them yet.

I want to believe this is just a bad phase, and when she settles and gets a job, she'll be back to her old happy self. I don't straight dislike being her 'beacon of happiness', but it worries me a lot, since I've got my job and my own things to do. I don't mind donating my free time to entertain her, as I really enjoy spending time with her - it's when I can't be with her that worries me.

I know it's not okay for her to depend on me like that, and I'd like to know what I can do to help her out. Therapy is out of the table, as I can't afford it right now.

My problem has to do with the favoritism that our son has shown to me lately. This is actually a great thing in my eyes! But it has left my wife extremely heartbroken and has made her start to resent me, even though I feel like the whole situation isn't a big deal at all.

Basically, up until the past few weeks, our son has always been a momma's boy. Anytime he was sick, hurt, did something amazing, or just about anything, he went straight to my wife. They have always had an incredible bond and were thick as thieves, but lately he has really taken to me. Now daddy is who he wants when any of those things happen, and for the first time in his life, I feel like we're really starting to bond. It's not like I haven't been around. It's just that, other than playtime or diaper changes and feedings, I don't think he ever knew I existed.

However, my wife has not dealt very well with becoming the second parent. I feel bad for her, especially when my son screams for me to feed him, or tuck him into bed or read him stories. I know she wonders what happened given how only weeks ago she was his world and vice-versa.

It seems like her frustration with the situation has been directed towards me. There's not anything I can point to in particular, but I can feel the tension between us, and in general, she's been colder towards me. I can only assume that she partially blames me for this because of how she is acting. I have tried to reassure her that she is a great mother and that this is just a stage, but she's also convinced that she's a bad mother. In her words, obviously she must have done something wrong in order to push him away. She keeps trying to reinsert herself, but our son keeps rejecting her. As you can guess, this just keeps making everything worse and leaves my wife in tears because her son doesn't want her anymore. It could be, I guess, that maybe her reactions towards me have more to do with her own feelings as opposed to resentment for me. I am not sure. 

I think she's being ridiculous, but at the same time, I know how she feels. It is not a good place to be, but she's inconsolable.

What am I supposed to do? I enjoy my son's attention, but I don't want my wife to feel so sad. I don't think my son has done anything wrong, so I have no idea how to resolve this situation, especially when my wife is convinced she's a bad mother or that this is my fault. Help!

I discovered this yesterday when I noticed that the name of an ex-boyfriend was high on the list of Facebook contacts, as if she'd recently talked to him. We were watching something together on her laptop and she went to the toilet, leaving her Facebook logged in. 

A gut feeling prompted me to click on his name, the chat window popped up and there it was. Fairly explicit conversations about sex, him telling her to come visit and fuck him in his new bed, etc etc. I had about two minutes to look through it and I was able to establish this started about three days ago. Not wanting to read any more of it, I closed the window. I elected not to confront her about it right then and there, pretended everything was alright and had an (admittedly) nice evening with her that night when we went out to meet some of my friends.

Do I confront her about this? As far as I could tell, the conversation between her and her ex had tapered off yesterday and when he asked if she wanted to see him, she didn't give a definitive answer.

He has always been a VERY fast finisher, leaving me very much hanging 99% of the time. Totally OK with me taking care of my own needs and has even purchased toys and encouraged me to make use of them. I thought that this was something that I could live with. (I'm starting to feel extremely frustrated). 

Within the last 12 months I have dropped a significant amount of weight (50+lbs). This has caused a great deal of attention from those we know and seems to get me noticed by many that never did before. I get pm's on Facebook and instagram from  male friends/ acquaintances. Honestly, I don't always shut them down (I Do know how bad that sounds). In person, I actually have men come up to me and start conversations. 

I freely admit that my self esteem and self worth are in the shitter and directly tied to my physical appearance. I don't feel like I am worthwhile or valuable unless I am attractive / beautiful / sexy. (getting older is really hitting me hard). 


For a period of time, he was obese, it never deterred me at all, I still loved having sex with him regardless of how much he weighed.  He has also dropped 100+lbs (before I  dropped my weight).  He's quite average looking and very quiet so I have never seen him ever attract attention from other women. He is however, very secure with who he is, what he looks like and what his shortcomings are. 

Not long after we were married (12 years, currently) he began suggesting the idea of swinging or threesomes. The first time it was discussed, I was absolutely distraught, disgusted and thoroughly felt unloved and devalued. It was traumatic for me.  Since then, I have definitely warmed up to the idea, to the point that I am now actually looking into the whole thing quite seriously.  This has been a progression over a span of about 10 years. 

We have been through a  lot together and I am much more secure with our marriage than I was when swinging was first suggested.

 Couple that with years of less than satisfactory sex, no appreciation as far as being told that I am attractive or beautiful (outside of when we have sex) and I am starting to feel like swinging or even just bringing in another man is a good idea. 

So far, there has been no cheating by either one of us. I have kissed other men, but he is aware of this and was curious why I didn't take it further, bring them back to our hotel (always happened when we were on vacation or out of town).

A bit over a week ago i started to get this burning sensation when i peed so i went to the doctor and got it tested. A few days ago i got the answer to my test and it showed me being infected with chlamydia, for which I'm now receiving treatment for.


The thing is, i haven't slept with any other guy in the last year besides my boyfriend, so naturally i confronted him about it. He claims he haven't been unfaithful while we have been together, and he got no answers for how he may have gotten the disease and he is getting a check up at the doctor some time next week.
Now i want to believe him, i really do, but i just can't shake off the feeling he might be lying. He seems sincere enough and apologizes a lot and wants to make amends. I just can't see any other way for how else he could have gotten it. 

As far as i have read up on chlamydia, it only transfers during sex and the time between symptoms (if you are one of the 1/4 of people who get them) and infection is about a months time, meaning i would have gotten infected about a month ago. 
I just don't deem it plausible that we could have been together for 9 months before i contracted the disease, but to be honest I'm not really sure how chlamydia works for gay people.

11878,Relationships,384mte,"My girlfriend has always dreamed of being a veterinarian. I want her to be able to achieve this, but I have serious doubts about whether it is a realistic goal for her.

The first reason is that it will be academically challenging, and so far she has struggled greatly with academics.  She failed out of her first university, didn't meet their standards to be academically reinstated, came to this one (where we met), failed out again and got reinstated again. Our school's vet med program requires 60 credits and a selection of specific classes for admission, and overall it has taken her 6 years to achieve those 60 credits.

She has also not done well in actual veterinary environments - she has worked at three, and been fired from all of them.  For one she was fired because she was supposed to be the person checking in on animals over the holidays and she just plain forgot.  At the next she was fired because she was unable to master basic skills as her employer put it.  She was fired from the third one after she had an outburst caused by stress in the office.  I worry that if she can't handle 15 hours a week as an assistant in a vet's office, being the vet full time is going to be tough for her.

The veterinary schools she applied to also did not have a great deal of confidence. After she was rejected by the school we go to now, she applied to more than a dozen other vet schools and was rejected to every single one. Her grandfather was able to get her an appeal interview at our current school after pulling some strings, and she was rejected again.  Finally he pulled in more strings (and some favors) to get her accepted.  She is barely meeting their requirements - her GPA is 2.02, she had to take one of the required classes 4 times to pass, etc.

I want to support her and I want to buy into the idea that anyone can do anything they set their mind to, etc. And for a long time now I've thought she's smart, she's kind, she's passionate, these are just bumps in the road. But recently I've started seeing it from a more unbiased perspective and I don't feel confident in her.  To tell you the honest truth I think her chances of successfully completing vet school are maybe 10%.

There's an added complication of the fact that the only way she was able to get to 60 credits is by quitting working for the past two semesters - she could not handle both school and work at the same time. Assuming vet med is the same, I would be supporting her financially while she goes to school, and she will have $90k in student loan debt at the end (assuming it takes her the minimum amount of time to complete the program).  I feel hesitant to agree to support her financially when I honestly am not sure that it will even pan out.

How can I be supportive when my honest belief is that she would be better off in the long run doing something else?  Should I come right out and tell her that, or should I keep trying to be supportive even if it means lying to her?

Along with that, we're ostensibly in an open relationship, but he doesn't like it when I see other people. I don't want to rock the boat and upset him by seeing other people so I haven't slept with anyone else for ~3 months. 



We've had a good, fun time together but it just isn't what I thought it was now that we're in different stages of our lives. I care lots about him and feel horribly selfish for even vocalising these thoughts. How do I let him down gently?

11883,Breakups,36xxk4,"Now the nature of this relationship is a little complicated (I can provide if necessary) but to put you up to speed on things so far: it's long distance (difference states) but not too far (i.e. we can meet up a few times a year) and there was potential for living within the same city. Because of the distance and the uncertainty of when we could be physically together, my partner suggested we don't commit to one another since she doesn't want to stop me from meeting someone who could be better for me and that she'd feel bad if I decided not to date someone on the basis that her and I still had a serious long distance relationship going on. She emphasized a lot of times that she's not saying this because she wants to see other people but just for my best interests. However one thing that I found a little odd was that she requested we still remain emotionally involved with one another should I start seeing someone and I'm not really sure if I could have done that - just found that a little odd. 

**Anyways, now for the issue at hand.** I was talking about how if I end up becoming too busy with school and work when she moves to my city, I may not be able to commit to a serious relationship as I just wouldn't be giving her the best that I could. She suggested we try a friends with benefits relationship and I was not okay with that as it's just not something I do. The first point I mentioned is that I need to really care about someone to sleep with them and I don't know if I could achieve that in a casual relationship. Secondly, I feel taking that step could stop us from ever going back to being friends. In response to this, she said she'd had several successful friends with benefits relationships before and she is still friends with the guys she was with. 

We talked some more about sex and what it means to us and it became clear we value different things in intimate relationships. For me, sex has always been something I can only share with someone I deeply care about and who feels the same way about it as I do - it's as much an emotional experience for me as it is a physical one and I've always felt it's important for my partner to feel the same way. She says I might be overemphasizing things and feels that she can comfortably have sex with someone she doesn't care about - not necessarily someone anonymous, but she is fine with having sex solely for pleasure. 

Now I don't have any problems with that attitude - it's fine to like sex simply because it feels good. But I just feel it's important for my partner to share my attitude towards sex - am I wrong to do so? When I brought this up as my reason for wanting to break up, I tried to make it clear that I'm not being judgemental of her actions (I couldn't care less about how many people someone has slept with) but her attitude towards sex was something that bothered me. She said that wasn't a good enough reason for breaking up with her and said it's not like she doesn't have the potential to have meaningful sex and I kind of didn't know what to say. I've always stuck by a personal code of no hook ups, no one night stands, no friends with benefits - am I wrong to expect the same in a partner? She was extremely upset about this and called me a lot of things but mainly she said I'm ignorant, judgemental, not a nice guy, and worst of all, a slut shamer. She said she'd been nothing but good to me (before calling me those things) and didn't deserve to be broken up with for this reason. 

The experience has left me with a lot of questions about myself and what I look for in relationships. Help me out, Reddit - if I am wrong, what do I do to change myself to avoid this happening again? I really liked this girl but because of this difference in values I just couldn't see myself being with her anymore.

11884,Dating,2yp0md,"I just got out of a two year relationship and i am trying to start rebuild my life. This was my first serious relationship and the breaking up was honestly much harder than i expected.

I am still in college right now and I do work study. This girl (i will refer to her as Tracy) is working the same position as me. Tracy and i were not very close before this year. We didn't hang out beside grabbing lunch together and study together occasionally. She recently got dumped by her boyfriend too and she seemed lonely for the most part earlier this year. She asked me to hang out as friends and stuff but i ignored most of the invitations because my ex would get crazy jealous whenever i talk to other girls.

About a month ago, i broke up with my ex. Meanwhile, Tracy built herself a new social circle and started hanging out with her new friends. She even invited me to hang out with them but i declined because i needed time after the break up. My life was a mess at the time and i needed to focus on myself.

i got a lot closer with Tracy in the past month and she is really friendly to me. I misread some of her friendly signs as being flirtatious with me.  i started to have a crush on her, i am fairly certain part of it is because i was lonely after the break up. I wanted to wait for her to show me enough signs of interest before i ask her out. Me being a doofus in girls automatically assumed that Nice Guy Good Friend role.

By now i am sure she wasn't showing me enough signs that she likes me more than a friend. Yesterday we went for lunch and it became really awkward for us. She stopped responding to my texts nicely.

This week is spring break and although Tracy originally was going to hang out with me, she said she is going on a road trip with her new friends. i have decided to back away from her at this point.

My question is, how should i behave when she gets back from the break?

1. Should I just pretend nothing happened and continue to be friendly to her? I need some time to get over my feelings for her and i don't think one week is enough. It is impossible for me to cut contact with her because i will see her almost every week day.

2. I always have the problem of being too nice to people and thus failing terribly at girls in general. They love to think i am the nice guy friend. I want to change that. For example, I help Tracy write her weekly paper (by that i mean i type the whole thing). I want to stop doing things like this. I don't want her to think i'm being a dick just because she didn't show me interest. This is more about me than her. How should i do this?

3. I was thinking of talking to her and actually tell her my feelings for her. This seems like a bad idea? One thing i want to change is not being desperate about girls anymore and this seems exactly like it. it will also be very awkward for us in the next few months.

4. I am leaving for another country during summer and will be attending a new college in the fall. I won't be seeing her for months. Things will be very different for me by that time. Should i ask her out in the future?

Turns out my SO enjoys anal penetration...a lot. He has a massive collection of plugs and dildos that he only ever uses by himself. I found out when he admitted to me one day that he was wearing a plug after I came home early from work and knew something was up. I'm not proud of it, but I freaked out.

I felt betrayed that he's had years to try and bring it up and incorporate it into our sex life together and never bothered trying. It's one thing to watch porn and masturbate by yourself, but this feels like a whole double secret life he has.

What's even worse is that his need to indulge in this habit is so great that for months he's been lying to me saying he was working late, coming home at 3 AM. He's never given me any other reasons not to trust him, so I never questioned or suspected him of doing anything other than working. He made me feel so guilty for texting him sometimes on these late nights at work asking him to wrap up whatever he was doing and come home. I had no idea it was spending hours locked in his office building watching porn and playing with his toys. 

After the initial freakout we've had several lengthy arguments/conversations where I've asked and he's agreed to take a step back and slowly bring me into this brand new world of his. I've admitted it's a big scary thing for me, but have made it a point never to attack or criticize him or the sexual things he enjoys that he's felt the need to hide. I want something that he apparently really enjoys to become a part of our sex life together, but he keeps letting me down. He's promised dozens of times to work on trying new things in the bedroom and being able to talk about this all openly. He continues to fail. He keeps letting me down by running away to his office and staying until 2 or 3 in the morning. 

I should add that several years ago out of the blue, while we were both at work, he asked me what I thought about the idea of pegging. I told him I was in no way shape or form ready for that, that he should have taken my experience (or lack of) into consideration and started by asking if I'd finger him, play with a plug, ANY smaller step instead of going straight for pegging. I honestly thought it was something he'd seen here on reddit and decided might be fun to try. After that I stuck my finger in his ass a few times, and never received any sort of positive feedback, hey I enjoyed that thing you did the other night, can you try it again, nothing. So that was the end of that and we never talked about it again. In hindsight pegging is something he was obviously ready for but, again, never stopped to consider me or my feelings. He continues to point to that event as his reasoning for hiding this from me for so long.

I just can't get over the lies and complete failure to TRY and make things better between us and I don't know what to do. My insurance won't cover couple's therapy. Every time I share my thoughts and feelings with him it just seems to push him further into his little closet of sexual desires that he's not willing to share.  Reddit, I need some in advice.

11889,Relationships,1vir94,"I am going to try to make this as short as possible. I hope this is the right place for it. I had to make a throwaway, because I am embarrassed. I have always had issues with my sexuality. I feel like a slut, for wanting sex, when I know that thought is wrong. Ok here goes. 

I have been married 1.5 years (our 2 year is in June). We have known each other for 3 years. It was a very quick, wow this person is me but in male/female form we fell in love fast, and experienced some things that really tell you if you can handle the long run together. I love him as a person, it is the sex that worries me. 

So the sex part: When we first started dating it was cute, he didn't want to make me have sex unless I wanted it. I thought that was very honorable. 

Then we dated longer and the sex was good. Never wild and crazy mind you, as I have had in the past, and never oral, which confused me, but I let it slide. I tried to go down on him, but it was like he pulled me back up/ was soft (some people do not like oral?). I did not know why he did not want me to give him head as all men want that, right?  He never went down on me.. 

When we had sex, mostly missionary, the penetration was good (lasted for at least 10 minutes, this is sad the more I think about it). I was happy with what we had. (I have never gotten off through penetration, I have always just enjoyed it, as it was.)etc, etc. 

We got married. He deployed. (He is in the military, first deployment was 4 months long, and about 1.5 years after we met, right after we got married) He came back and sex got weird. .. **here are my complaints**.. 

-sex is short. It feels as if he gets hard, penetrates and is done. It frustrates me so bad.  (we have talked about it, he keeps saying I don't know what is wrong with me)

-sometimes he feels as if he stays soft forever. (I am not used to this. I am used to my exes always being ready to go. I am shy, so I am not used to having to get someone ready to have sex. This makes me feel unattractive)

-sex is very infrequent. (I thought if we had sex more often he would be able to stay harder longer. No matter if we have it frequently or hardly ever, it is always short)

I'm sorry, this is probably a horrible post, I am just so fed up with my sex life. I need some rough, I want you right now, doggystyle, go down on each other, sex. All I seem to get is missionary, I'm afraid of sex, sex.

11890,Relationships,2m7xti,"First time posting here -

I've been dating my boyfriend for about a year now and things are generally good.  We have similar interests, like all the same types of television shows and movies, genuinely enjoy hanging out with each other.

The only real catch is that he's completely oblivious and says/does hurtful things without knowing.  He's one of those guys who just talks without thinking and really has no personal filter.  I really don't think he genuinely means to be hurtful, it just doesn't even occur to him that these things would bother someone else.  

Some examples:

* I'm 5'4 and have a small frame.  I've always been one of those lucky people who can eat anything I want, but the late 20s have hit me and my metabolism has hit a wall.  I went from 120 at the beginning of our relationship to currently 130, but I still wouldn't consider myself fat and am still pretty comfortable with my body.  He likes to squeeze my belly (where most of my weight has gone) and say things like Wow, you're getting really chubby or he sometimes likes to call me Chubs as a nickname.  I say that this is hurtful but he says that when he went through a fat phase, it really encouraged him to work out when other people pointed out how fat he was.  

* It's happened a few times so far where we've gone to major social functions (weddings, big parties, etc.) and he's pretty much ignored me the entire night.  I consider it really important for him to chat with his friends at these events without me/not feel the need to babysit me so I try as much as possible to give him space but I would like to be included at least some of the time.  I'm not exactly the most comfortable person in situations where I'm around people I don't know, so I offer to not go sometimes (so he doesn't have to check up on me or worry about me) but he always says it's really important that I'm there.  Still I tend to feel generally ignored - for example, at the last wedding we went to, he switched dinner tables to be able to talk to other friends and did not tell me.  I later found him an hour later on the dance floor and was pretty hurt that he didn't bother to include me in the switch to the other table or the dancing that happened afterward.

* I've become somewhat good friends with his group of best friends although we don't ever hang out without him.  His best friend's wife is a bit older than them and they make fun of her all the time for it.  I defend her (as the only other woman I feel like I have to side with her for bonding purposes, plus she actually looks younger than them) all the time.  I actually didn't know for a long time she was older than them so I sent him a private chat message discussing how surprised I was that she was actually older.  He took a screen shot of our conversation and manipulated it so that it looked like I said wow, she's really old and emailed it to all his friends saying, see? she's not really on your side.  He thought it was HILARIOUS but I thought it made me look like an idiot (not to mention made me look like I was talking shit about her behind her back).

These are the bigger examples, there are a lot of smaller things, like making fun of the things I wear (I have a sweater that he tells everyone I stole from a hobo) or obnoxiously examining things I've cleaned and pointing out spots I've missed.  I feel like these are all pretty small, nit-picky things and in isolation they're not really that troublesome, but after a while it just builds up.  

I always point these things out to him and he's always really apologetic and genuinely feels bad that he's upset me.  It just gets tiring and frustrating because it's only a matter of time before it happens again (many times the same exact thing happens again) and he always says things like I've never had a girlfriend before so I just don't know how to act or I just didn't even think that would hurt your feelings and that he needs me to teach him what is appropriate/inappropriate to say.  At this point I feel like he should know better and that I shouldn't have to keep telling him that these things are hurtful.  

What do I do, Reddit?  He's a good guy and he means well, he's just completely clueless and I don't want to feel like I'm nagging him.

So I have this friend. He expresses zero interest is me. In fact maybe the opposite of interest to the point of almost being mea.  I'm not socially attractive but he is. We've only hung out a few times. But we see each other often in a non-social setting. 


Our friendship isn't a close one. He only hangs out with me when he has no other options. Or when the girl he likes (my friend) is going. I'm ok with this. He's fun to hang out with and I don't need him for those super deep exchanges. We are just friends. I've even encouraged him attempting to have a relationship with my friend. 


Last night a few of us went out for some drinks. We ended up back at his place as it was close and he has furniture we could sleep on. My friend (the girl he likes) and I ended up in his bed. A full sized bed.  And he climbed in between us. It was kind of odd because we'd never really been all that playful or close to each other. And neither of us expected him to do that.  But alcohol. You know. 

So he climbs in and right away pulls me over to him so my head is resting kind of on his arm and chest. Then we kinda shifted so his left leg was under my legs. My legs were bent up so the top of my knees/thighs were against his junk. And he put his right leg on top of my legs. Sandwiching my legs between his. And put his free arm on my arm. Kind of holding it with his hand near my elbow as my arm was draped over his belly. His other arm still holding me close to him. 


There was so funny business. And it felt safe in that closeness. It was nice laying with someone who didn't expect anything sexual. But why did he hold me all night when the girl he's been truly interested in was just on the other side of him? Why didn't he cuddle with her? Why me when he has never once acted interested? Seriously. It sometimes even feels like he's avoiding me. In fact today he even stated that he was disappointed he didn't get any alone time with my friend. 


The girl he likes is petite. Big breasted. Incredibly pretty and cute. Thin. Very nice and funny. A catch. Meanwhile I'm about 200 pounds. Pale. Not at all attractive. But the way he held me in that bed and initiated such a loving physical closeness made me see him differently. And I want it to happen again. But I just don't understand why he did it. Any ideas?

So basically what's happened is that I asked a co worker to prom last friday. I'm in 17 (in grade 12) and she's 16 (in grade 11) and we've been working with each other for the last 6 months. We go to the same school but haven't talked to one another until this year.

She went into near tears and told me that someone else had asked her just a couple hours ago in school!

The thing is, almost all I could think about after that fight (in addition to the sadness I would feel if we did break up) is that I would lose our dog. We got him together, and I love him to death, but there's not a question of who would get him if we broke up, and it wouldn't be me. 

I found my perfect apartment. But they don't allow dogs. When I think about living alone again, there's something that feels freeing about that. But then I look at the dog and am sad because I won't have him with me anymore. 

My boyfriend is a wonderful person, and I don't mean to say I wouldn't miss him terribly. I would. Am I just projecting my relationship sadness onto the dog? Are my feelings of guilt about leaving him really feelings of guilt for letting my boyfriend down? 

If I haven't been clear on anything, just ask. I'm at a loss, here. I don't know what to do.

11897,Breakups,2c59yc,"We were only together 6 months, but so much was packed into that time. Trips to see his family, time spent with his son, and a vacation in Europe, all to end with him saying that he couldn't fall in love with me and that we are not in the same stage of life (I'm a 24 year old PhD student and he is a 31 year old business professional with a 7 year old son). 

He says that he wants a family unit to come home to after almost 7 years of being a single dad (and co-parenting with his son's mother), which makes sense, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt. So bad.

The night that we broke up (a month ago), we were both very sad. But before I could even detach myself by doing the necessary things such as unfriending him on Facebook, my phone told me that he was staying the night in a different city (Facebook messenger has this ridiculous app now called Nearby Friends which lists the city that your friend is in, in real time). Of course, once I saw that, I was upset, but figured it must be a mistake. However, after a while I noticed that he was consistently staying the night in the different city, and as much as I wanted to delete the app and unfriend him, I couldn't tear myself away. I was so weak.

He came by my place this week to exchange some of the stuff that we had of each other's, and I asked him to turn off the Nearby Friends app so that I couldn't see where he was at all of the time. Of course, when that came up, though, I couldn't help but bring up that I saw he was already staying the night somewhere else on the night that we broke up (and frequently since then). I know it is none of my business, but I just had to know.

Turns out he had gotten in touch with his almost 38 year old ex, asking for advice about our relationship (when he was contemplating breaking up with me). Since then, both of them have been talking and keeping in touch and staying the night with one another. He says that it makes him feel good because it is more like coming home to the family unit that he has been hoping for (she also has a son who is 10 years old).

I understand that she can give him that family that he is looking for which I can't right now (I won't be done with grad school for 2 years and after that I'll have to go out for a job, which will delay my time for having a family a bit more), but this just makes me sick. I remember him describing his relationship with her as miserable, and they even had to go through relationship counseling after being together for less than 2 years. I just don't understand.


It helps that she is SO different from me (a 37 yr old administrative assistant with a 10 year old son versus a 24 year old grad student), but it still kills me. It sounds so immature, but it is not fair that he doesn't even have to experience being lonely. He literally started dating someone again within an hour or so of breaking up with me. I can't handle this.

Someone, please, talk some sense into me. I don't know how to deal with this.

11900,Relationships,2x51qr,"So a little background first:

We met last summer and at first, I thought it would just be a fling. Then we started dating after 2 weeks of talking and a month after that, he dropped the I love you bomb. I wasn't sure if I actually loved him, and was particularly confused because his friends said that was very uncharacteristic of him. I waited a couple days and then realized I do love him. 

I went away for school and he still wanted to keep the relationship going. Let's just say the long distance really sucked and we were both awful at it. He became too distant, ignored me, just wasn't there for me really. On the other hand, I was a stressed out mess, something wrong was always happening, I didn't pay attention to his needs. They fed into each other. We probably should have broke up, but we didn't.

I decided my heart wasn't in the major anymore, and I wouldn't be happy doing it for the rest of my life, so I made the decision to come back home. Money was a HUGE factor. Paying 50k a year for a major that wouldn't be making enough money coming out was just setting myself up for financial failure. My decision was, in no way, influenced by my boyfriend. I didn't think we would last much longer anyway.

So I came home and things started to get a little better but my needs were still not satisfied. I decided to give it one last shot. I suck with talking about my feelings (still do) so instead of texting him a huge, tearful message, I composed my thoughts in a paper. Yes, a paper. I'm a lot better of a writer than just spilling my beans. Not like a I love you but... paper. This paper looked professional as fuck and was utterly emotionless, kinda like a textbook. It was to the point- what I need in a relationship, what I believe a relationship requires, what I won't settle for, etc. I gave it to him and a couple days later he came over. He wrote a paper too, dumping his feelings. After I was done reading it he told me it was a huge wake up call.

Ever since, everything has been great. He is a great listener. He's helped me a lot with my personal problems instead of hiding from them. He's getting his life more on track and I am, too. He's a lot more supportive about my life decisions. Whenever we hang out, he is a goofball and annoys me like it's no one's business. I've let go of my jealousy and he has let go of his pent-up-ness. We both have our own hobbies now. We're focused on school and work. So everything should be okay, right?

Now that everything is okay and the bullshit is sorted through, I can't help but feel weird. Someone is actually serious about me and now that it is pretty clear he's in this for the long run, I'm afraid to mess it up. I'm afraid of being over emotional and pushing him away like I did previously. I've made a lot of strides with myself but I'm afraid of reverting back so much, that when I think I have, I panic, in turn, actually reverting lol he reassures me that everything is okay and I calm down after a little bit. I really don't want this to continue and I'm not sure what this phenomena is, so what's your guys' advice? Thanks!

11902,Relationships,2qtcqp,"Hey, folks. I'm feeling really shitty and just need to get this off my chest. Maybe this isn't the place for this, although advice is definitely appreciated.


I've been dating Rick for two years now, and living with him for about eight months.  Moving in with him wasn't the smartest thing I've ever done; I saw the red flags, I KNOW what abuse looks like, and now I'm stuck in a rental house with a lease and a verbally abusive partner.

I guess I'm writing 'cause I'm not sure if I should just stick this out until the lease is up in March(I have a new, decent-paying job, and by then I'll have enough money saved for a new deposit and will be able to afford rent on my own) or if I should just get out now.  Getting out now isn't easy, I need to reread my lease, but I'm pretty sure I'll need to pay a hefty fee if I break it.  Something like three month's worth of rent.  I'm not really close to anyone I can crash with either, I have a close circle of friends but most of us moved to different areas after college.  I also haven't talked to anyone about the abuse...I'm feeling ashamed, which I know is silly, because HE should be ashamed, not me! I just can't shake feeling like this is somehow my fault.


I'm only just now writing this because I can see things escalating. Rick has never gotten physical, it's always verbal/emotional abuse.  Basically, if I forget to do something I said I'd do, or if I do something wrong, Rick overreacts, raises his voice, and calls me names.  I hadn't checked the litter box for his(yes, his) cats in a while, for example, and one of the cats had peed on the floor.  Rick raised his voice(he gets mad if I call it yelling, but that's what it is) and told me how he wishes my Dad had raised me better, how lazy and arrogant I am, etc.  Almost every time he gets angry with me he refers to how my parents raised me and tells me I'm either lazy or arrogant.  Honestly, I just forgot to check the cat box that day.


Recently I forgot to do something small(something very specific, and I'm worried he reads Reddit so I'll keep this vague), and honestly the thing I forgot was not a big deal and had no repercussions for him or anyone else. It was a quick two minute fix, and no one was the wiser.  Despite this, he proceeded to say fuck you over and over, and then said, you are a cunt. you are being a cunt, and I don't care how that makes you feel, because you obviously don't care about my feelings.  He had never called me cunt before, which is why I'm seeing this as escalating...he went from listing character flaws(which is bad enough) to calling me hurtful names.


I used to bring this up to him. I would tell him that I felt he was too harsh, that I was sorry that I made a mistake and would try not to make such a mistake again, but that I didn't deserve to be called names.  Now I don't bother.  He'll just say people who think words matter that much are ridiculous.  He'll tell me I'm too sensitive, or twist the conversation back to what I did wrong. I'm so, so SO tired of walking on eggshells around him.  I'm obsessive with how I act now, trying so hard not to mess up again, but I know inevitably he will find SOMETHING to yell about.


Once, I hadn't messed up for a good while, and he DID find something. He asked if I had rent ready, and I said I would in two days (rent wasn't due for like ten days at that point, so we were fine).  He starts getting really angry with me, telling me I'm irresponsible and that I can't just assume that money will work out...but I knew I would have the money! It wasn't possible for it to not work out, unless my job suddenly fired me or something.  I didn't even know what to say at that point, I just did what I always do and tried to de-escalate. He said I was being bitchy(which...in his mind isn't the same as calling me a bitch?), so I shut down entirely and just let him do his thing.


I really feel like I have to make every single decision, no matter how small, with him in mind, otherwise I'll miss something and he'll call me names again.  I NEVER call him names during an argument.  I try to do the right thing, use I statements, keep my voice calm, etc.  Eventually I stopped doing that and would just cry.  Now I don't even cry...I just close up and dissociate.  


I know how unhealthy this is.  I know I need to get out, for the sake of my self esteem and sanity.  I'm just not seeing how it's possible until my lease is up.  Thanks for taking the time to read this, folks.  I really appreciate it.

I have my own bedroom, mostly for art/guests but it does have a bed in it. I've been sleeping on the couch though because it's comfy and because I feel like sleeping in my bed is a bit *too* antisocial. I don't know. It just feels weird, vs going to the couch. However, if my husband was totally on board with my sleeping alone, I'd be in my own bed, alone, every night!

I will lay in bed with my husband until he falls asleep. When he is tired, he is out in 5 minutes or less. Then I lay there, trying to sleep. It doesn;t happen. 

We've tried every solution for his snoring, and it has not worked. He also talks/moans/makes noises in his sleep. I am a very light sleeper and it takes complete silence for me to fall asleep. If I do end up falling asleep, I wake up a handful of times in the night to him snoring or pretty much laying on top of me. It's really frustrating, so I end up getting upset about it. The last time I had a full night of sleep is when I had a day off and ended up sleeping from 6am until 3pm because I couldn't sleep on the bed and my husband kept getting up to come get me from the couch. I eventually gave up around 3am and just stayed awake in the bed. 

I don't want to spend my rare days off sleeping ALL day. Plus I *like* sleeping at night. I work early, usually, (5am til 1 or 2pm) so I need to sleep! I usually end up getting 4 or so hours of sleep, sometimes less. It's not rare for me to fall asleep at 2am and have my alarm go off at 4am. 

I tried to talk to him about this before he went to bed, and he pretty much said he is not okay with me sleeping out of the bed. He's tried all sorts of things to cure his snoring, but like I said.. when he isn't snoring he is making some sort of sound or rolling over into my space. It's something he can't help, plus he is a heavy sleeper so waking him up is hard to do. I can kick him repeatedly and he won't even flinch. Short of pouring water on his face (which I won't do), waking him up is impossible. If I do get him to respond, it's while still half asleep and he promptly passes out within 30 seconds.

I broke up with my ex-gf three months ago. She was my first everything and I was feeling tied down and constricted by our relationship. Once I got back to school, a month later, I realized that this was a colossal fuckup.

For school we're living together; it's not something I can change. I approached her about my feelings but she shot me down. Within two weeks of us breaking up one of her friends had approached her and she was already involved with him. That really hurt; the few weeks after were hell, and it still hurts when she has sex with him when I'm in the suite, but I got through it. I started talking to other girls, without success, but whatever, I'm trying. Throughout all of this I'm processing the pain that she seemingly got to skip, and eventually I realize that I can just be friends with her. This is where it gets confusing.

So I talked to her, settled everything out, and we began to be friends. But the thing is, all of a sudden, it's like we never broke up. Due to several factors our relationship had kind of died a couple months before I broke it off, but it's like what we had before that. She flirts with me ALL THE TIME and acts exactly like when we were dating; the only difference from when we were together is there's no physical component. She does stuff like feeding me from her hand when I'm driving, and she gets this look in her eyes which is hard to explain but she used to give all the time when we were together.

She also takes pride in showing her new boyfriend off to me, and even makes it a point to show me how much sex they're having, and how they're doing it in ways she and I never did. If I ever so much as mention having sex with another women, however, she just kind of shuts down the conversation.

To be clear, I know exactly why our relationship died. It was mostly my fault, and I'm working on those things, but I don't want another go with her for a long time and I think it would be much better if we could just kind of coexist for awhile. I have expressed this to her, yet she is acting in a manner which I find disharmonious with my idea of a simple friend. So my question is, why? I know for a fact she's not into me anymore, so is she just trying to hurt me?

11908,Relationships,2d84dd,"I feel stupid for posting here, but I have been sad, stressed, and feeling kind of hopeless lately about my marriage.

My husband and I got together when we were in highschool, me being 14, him 16.  We've now been married for 3 years.  He is my friend, and I feel comfortable around him, but I usually feel neglected, and I guess I have been for a long time.  What happened recently just put a nail into my heart and I am trying to not be so emotional about it, but it is hard.

Our anniversary was July 20th.  My husband wanted to go to the DOTA 2 International tournament, which took place the week of our anniversary.  I said that would be fine, thinking if anything we could spend some time together in Seattle on our anniversary.  He said he wanted me there, too, and didn't want to be away from me on our anniversary.

So we get there, and I can tell this is going to take more time than expected.  The whole week, he hardly spent any time with me, which was fine I guess. I sort of expected him to be busy, so I let it slide.

Whenever we did get moments together, walking around markets or whathaveyou, I always talked to him about how excited I was for our anniversary.  I told him how beautiful the flowers in Seattle were, and how I would love to have some flowers for our anniversary.  I told him this every.single.day. 

The day of our anniversary came, and I only got to see him for a couple of hours after the DOTA games ended.  I surprised him with a gift bag with his favorite types of teas and gave him a hug.  He gave me absolutely nothing.  Not even a warm hug, or a kiss, or anything.  No Happy anniversary. Nothing at all.  When I gave him my gift his reaction was just something like Oh... um... thanks.

He pretty much ignored me and just hung out with his friends and talked about DOTA the whole time, and I was starting to get fed up, so when I finally got a moment alone with him I told him how sad and disappointed I was that he didn't even ACKNOWLEDGE our anniversary.  We argued some, and then went to bed.

The next day I had a few hours alone with him again, so we were walking around Seattle and I was once again commenting on how beautiful the flowers were, and how I would love some.  He still didn't get me any.  He said I thought about it, but then I knew they would die, so I will get you some whenever we go home.  We will celebrate our anniversary properly at home, too.

Alright... Fair enough...

So we get home, and I don't want to be a nag or anything, so I don't say anything... and the days pass by... and pass and pass...  And we never did celebrate, and he never gave me flowers, and never even said happy anniversary... nothing at all.
Finally, about 10 days later, he said I'm sorry for never doing anything for our anniversary.  Apology accepted, and I thought maybe he would make amends then... but now it has been several days later yet again... and still absolutely nothing.  No belated happy anniversary, no special meal, no flowers, nothing.

I just can't help but feel sad and just very neglected and... I just don't know what.  I have had feelings of neglect well before this, and this sort of was the straw on the camel's back so to speak.

I'm the breadwinner of the two of us... and I just feel so used sometimes.  My job is sooo stressful.  It causes me a lot of physical and emotional pain, as well as social isolation.  Whenever I am available and my husband needs something at work because he forgot it, I have no trouble driving over there and visiting him and giving him lunch or whatever it is he needed...  When I forgot my money at home and I didn't have any lunch packed for work, I asked him if he could bring me something, and he said something like Well, I don't WANT to have to drive up there... but I will if I HAVE to... Yes... that is not an exaggeration.

Then, after maybe 3-5 minutes into the massage, he says things like I can't do this all night, you know.

I just feel soooo sad.  I don't even know how to describe it.  I feel so stupid for getting so worked up over something so cliche, but lately it all just feels like it is too much.

I talked to him about it tonight.  I told him how sad I was that he never acknowledged our anniversary, and I don't want flowers or anything because at this point it wouldn't be from his heart, it would be only because I whined for flowers... which defeats the whole purpose.  It really isn't about the flowers at all.  I just feel neglected... and I told him that... I just don't know what else to do.

We were spending a lot time together and after a while (months) I had very strong feelings about him and I started being really nice with him, making him a sandwich in the morning, giving home ride home everyday or just making him laugh. One day I got upset at work and was not very nice with him, I kind of unload on him but I wasn't even mad AT him. Even though I apologized and he said it was ok but suddenly after that he started kind of pushing me back and being very rude with me, not answering my messages or calls, and if he did, he would tell me that he would call me back and he didn't.

I am in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend of almost a year. A month ago, my friend (who lives in his area) came across him on Tinder and she sent me a screencap of him. It said that he was active on there a few hours ago from when she came across him, so naturally I freaked out a little and confronted him about it. He reassured me that he wasn't using it and I wanted to trust him, because trust is such a fundamental aspect of a LDR.


A few days ago, my friends and I discovered that you can see who's using the app Down (formerly known as Bang my Friends) using a Facebook graph search so out of curiosity, we looked to see which of our friends were on it. Lo and behold, my boyfriend is one of the 4 males on my friend list who use it.

But the problem is I really care about him and am tired of painful breakups. So if I can foresee that I can leave him for someone else in the future or that our differences will tear us apart, it is probably better to end things now. 


The differences I speak of are the status/education ones. He did not go to University and I am starting my post-grad program tomorrow! To be honest, that actually didn't really bother me because it's not important to me that he has a university degree. But then I started to realize that I may be looked down upon by peers if I date down education-wise since guys need to be higher-status than their GFs.

Six weeks ago, I meet Chris at a party thrown by out mutual friend Jeff.  Chris and Jeff are good friends from high school, and Jeff and I go to the same university.  Chris is in town to visit Jeff for the weekend, but normally goes to college 5 hours (and three states) away from Jeff and I.

Chris and I bond over telling stories about stupid things Jeff had done.  I beat him in a drinking game, and we continue to flirt and talk throughout the party. We end up making out pretty heavily for a while at the end of the night.    He asks if he can kiss me, which I thought was pretty darn cute.  He walks me home and asks for my number, and of course I say yes! 

To my delight, Chris texts me the next morning.  He tells me straight out that he likes me and that he didn't intend the night before to be a one-time thing.  We text every day for the next six weeks, having no trouble keeping the conversation going for that time.  It's not all that flirty or suggestive or anything, but it's definitely nice to have someone to talk to. 

Pretty early on during this time, Chris decides he is going to come surprise Jeff at a Halloween party.  I am the only one who knows, and it's so hard to keep it a secret, but I do.  

--- 
*He's here!  Happy times!*

When Chris gets to my place, he looks so handsome, and I'm elated when he wraps me in a big hug.  We hang out for a few hours before it's time to go to the party, and it is amazing to talk to him in person after texting for so long.   He kisses me and said, I've been waiting to do that for a while now.   So then we, uh, kill some time before the party...

Chris and I pull off the surprise perfectly, and Jeff about pees his pants, he's so excited to see Chris.  He jumps up and hugs him and even kissed him on the cheek!  (Jeff is straight, they just have about the biggest bromance since Turk &amp; JD.)

The rest of the night and the weekend is AMAZING.  We get along so well, and it's clear that we both really like each other - not only physically, but as whole people.  (This is so nice, because I haven't had such a strong mutual attraction to someone in a while...or ever).  We have a great time spending time together exclusively, as well as with Jeff and I's group of friends.  People at the party comment on how cute Chris and I were together, and are still talking about it few days after the party.

---
*Sunday:*

Sunday morning comes sooner than anyone wants it to, and Chris has said all of his goodbyes except to me.  I walk with him to his car, and he hugs me for a while.  Then he pulls away and says, so what's next?  Shoot.  We'd both been avoiding this question.  I stammer out a few words, and we get in his car to talk it over.  I say that I don't think it's worth it to just keep talking if we don't have any clear definitions, expectations, or guidelines.  Someone will get hurt, and things will get messy and confusing.  Better to end on a high note, right?

Having only spent three days together in person, it's a huge commitment to make to someone to start a LDR.  Especially when we have no idea if we will ever be in the same area.  He is graduating in a month and doesn't know what his plans are, but he may end up at my university for graduate school.  

After he drives home, he texts me that at first he felt really sad about our agreement to stop pursuing anything and just remain friends, but now he thinks it's for the best.  

I reply saying that I also felt really sad about it, and had actually changed my mind and wanted to make things work if he did.  He was flattered because he feels that way too (yay!), but also is still hesitant.

We gave each other more time to think about it, and talked on the phone that night.  It was so nice to hear his voice.  He said that over the weekend things were going so well he almost reconsidered the issue of distance, and that he became more attached to me than he was ever expecting.  But again we decided it is for the best if we just call it friends for now, and see where our lives take us.  

I still feel a little sad, but I don't know if it's just a normal break-up sad, or if it's the kind of feeling you get when you've made the wrong choice.

Even just typing this story out makes me feel sick.

I've known P since my freshman year of high school. He is undoubtedly one of the closest friends that I've ever made. About three months ago, P introduced us to his girlfriend, B. If I'm remembering correctly, the two of them had met six months earlier and had been dating for three of those months (might only be one). I was blown away by her. B was beautiful, funny, caring, etc. We hit it off the night that we met. I was both genuinely happy for my friend and very saddened that he had met her first. 

I saw B on several occasions over the next several weeks and was thrilled when I did. She attempted to talk to me over facebook during this time, but I ignored her messages or gave her one word answers, as I didn't want my friend to think that I was at all interested in her. B developed a friendship with my FWB, mentioned that she thought I was cute, and asked a lot of questions about me. Some of this stuff was pretty nosy, especially after B learned that her new friend and I were sleeping together.

About two months ago, B broke up with P. He was pretty upset by it. I felt badly that she had hurt him, badly enough that I pushed away any thoughts of being with her. My FWB told me that B also felt badly about it, though probably less so than P. A few weeks after the breakup, P was meeting with and hooking up with other girls. I didn’t have any contact with B during this time, and anything I heard about her was through my FWB.

Two weeks ago, my FWB told me that B would be couch surfing the following week. I purposefully spent the night on Thursday, when I knew B would be over. I feel like a pig for what happened next. I genuinely was not planning on having sex with my FWB that night, but she initiated.  I was literally having sex while fantasizing about the girl in the next room.

My FWB left for work the following morning. She trusted me enough to close the windows, lock the door, etc. so that B and I could sleep in for an extra hour. I woke up to B sitting next to me and hitting me in the stomach playfully. I sat up and we spoke for a few minutes. I asked her if she was okay, as she had seen P on Thursday and had spoken to FWB that night. I had heard them speaking in the living room while I was in the bedroom. She said that she was mostly okay. I showered and we left FWB’s apartment.

We walked to the train together. I’ve run through this scenario a hundred times over the past few days and I cannot for the life of me explain what prompted this. We reached the platform and I put my arms around her to try to give her a comforting hug. I leaned in to kiss her on the cheek and before I knew it we were kissing. I realized what I had done and stepped away, but she pulled me back towards her. We kissed a few more times while waiting for the train, we held hands as we walked, and I kissed her goodbye. 

Since then I’ve spoken to her nearly nonstop. We’ve discussed the implications of what happened several times. Some choice quotes:

B: “You know that I wouldn’t be just a casual just for fun hookup though right? That’s not me, I get too invested for that.”

Me: “I know. But the thought of that doesn’t quite scare me off.”

B: “I thought that’s the last thing you wanted.”

Me: “I don’t know what I want. I feel like we click, though. At least a little. Don’t you?”

B: “Always have.”

Me: “You always have felt that?”

B: “We have more in common than me and P ever did.”

……

On the two of them ruining their friendship:

B: “We never should’ve dated. It’s such a shame.”

…….

Me: “Do you feel like what I did yesterday felt kind of “right?” “

B: “The only things I feel bad about in regards to it is that a person we care about could get hurt.”

Me: “That’s exactly what I think.”

B: “Do you wish you hadn’t?”

Me: “No. I wish that I regretted it. But I don’t.”

…….

Me: “It just felt natural yesterday morning.”

B: “Doesn’t it bother you at all though?”

Me: “It bothers me that it would hurt P if he knew. I don’t regret kissing you. It felt right in that moment.”

B: “I know.”

Me: “Is that an ‘I know you feel that way’ I know, or an ‘I agree that it felt right’ I know?”

B: “It’s an ‘I’m a stupid idiot because I actually wanted it and didn’t think’ I know. It’s an ‘even though I liked it I should’ve stopped it’ I know.”

…..

On Saturday night I told my friend nothing more than that B had asked me to hang out next week. The two of us were both pretty drunk. I asked P if he would be okay with me seeing her, and he said “you have my blessing.” He also said “talk to me tomorrow.” Yesterday’s “talk to me tomorrow” conversation consisted of: “You know what I’m gonna say, man. I would really prefer you do not have any romantic relations with B.” I told him “Okay, that settles it then” and he thanked me.

Edit: Added note - P's roommate of four years has been dating another one of P's exes for the past two years. While the two of us were intoxicated, he mentioned this in an I've already had experience with this kind of way, but in our sober conversation, he framed it in an I've already got this on my mind kind of way.

Edit 2: To clear up a misunderstanding, P and B's Thursday encounter was a fluke due to the presence of a mutual friend. To my knowledge, they have not spent time together on any other occasion since the breakup.

I called up B and told her that P had since changed his mind. I asked her what she wanted to do. She said that she wants to wait and ask P again in the future. I have no idea if he’d ever be okay with the two of us dating, but I’m more than willing to wait. The next time she’d be in town would be October, so it’s not as though there’d be anything physical in the short term. B and I agreed to stay in touch until then. I plan on talking to her tonight. Not about anything serious, though. Just friendly conversation.

I struggle to put into words the passion in that kiss. Subconsciously or not, it was something that the two of us had wanted since the night we met. I know how crazy this makes me sound, and I know that I’m relatively young. But I'm not some stupid teenager. I'm an adult and despite knowing that I’ve betrayed someone close to me, I know how that kiss made me feel.  I know that my friend would be furious if he knew that I had kissed her. I feel that he would understand, though, if he could somehow have swapped places with me and experienced how *right* it felt.

So what should I do? Which one of us is being selfish?

11917,Relationships,26hxwk,"Recently I was/have been very depressed, and during this time I have stopped talking to most of my friends. However, I am feeling significantly better the past week or so, and have started talking to some people again.

One of these people in particular is this girl who I was basically best friends with since the beginning of 6th grade (I am in 7th now) until the past few months. Thus, the relationship has been about 1.5 years or so.

As I said, I stopped talking to her because I was feeling like shit. Now I feel much better, and want to be friends with her again. At this point, normally I would just start talking to her again, and that would be that.

Unfortunately, while I was feeling bad, I told my mother that I stopped talking to said girl because I thought she was an asshole. My mother apparently thought that it was a good idea to tell the girl's mom that I said that, and her mom told her. She came up to me one day recently and said So we haven't talked for a while... my mom says it's because you think I am an asshole. She was with one of her friends who said You are an asshole! in a sort of joke context I guess. The girl said Yeah... I kind of am... but she didn't seem to be too fazed by that. I didn't say anything then.

Later, I sent the girl a text saying If you care, yes. I did stop talking to you because I think you are an asshole. Ouch, that was a bad idea. She didn't really think that was why, I guess, so when she responded she was really confused/weirded out/whatever. So yeah, that didn't go too well.

So now that that happened, I feel like I should probably send her a text or something (I don't really get any chances to talk to her alone at school, so talking to her in person probably wouldn't work too well) regarding that whole fiasco, and how I still want to be friends with her; but I have absolutely no idea what to say. So I'm looking for ideas on what to say and if I should say anything, I guess...

11919,Dating,2oxzb0,"6 months ago, my fiance left me. We had moved across the country for my work (military). Getting there, the military unfortunately pushed back my date to start working awhile. Luckily my fiance accepted a good job in the town, so it wasn't a problem. We moved, she started working, and I did what I could and was going to wait for the military to start me. However, she changed when we got there. Essentially, she wasn't quite ready for real life to hit her. It was a maturity issue, but in the sense of needing to know how to be an adult and be happy, etc. Unfortunately, she let this affect her, and we ended up splitting up. She left me, with no job, no friends, no family, in the town. Suddenly I had a very expensive apartment to pay for and I didn't know anyone. I did what I had to do and it was a really challenging but positive learning experience. I'm better for it now in the long run, and it's good that we split before we got married. 

Fast forward and here I am. Ended up going on a road trip a bit ago just because. Travelled about 3500 miles because hey, why not. Saw friends, family, went sight seeing, the whole deal. Just me, very relaxing.

Then I met a girl in a city. We met on Tinder, of all places. Neither of us take tinder seriously or have ever done anything real with it. By some random chance, we ended up talking on it, eventually exchanging number. For the next few weeks, we talked constantly. We really hit it off. I ended up swinging back through her city on the end of my roadtrip to see her. I thought, why not? At very least it's a story to tell later. So we went on a date...

And it went really, really well. I stayed the night in the city with her (wasn't planning on it), and the next night. The chemistry between us was so good and we got along so well. The sex was fantastic. Normally the first time you have sex with someone, it's only ok, you know? This was actually really, really good. We both were super comfortable with each other. It felt way more like we had been dating for months already, not talking for a few weeks through text and then meeting in person for a day. 

Regardless, I had to leave and go home. We talked a lot and both (more or less) feel the same way about what happened, each other, the future. We aren't trying to force anything, no expectations, open to potentially dating (though it would have to be long distance), but being realistic about it all. All is fine. 

We've been talking a lot since I left and was all normal. She got busy with finals and work and was really busy, so I gave her some space as she asked so she could focus. We'd talk a bit at night for the past few days and that's it. Understandable, she's busy of course. 

It's just... man... I feel like I'm letting her affect me way too much. We aren't dating, it's likely (given the situation) that we won't end up dating (because of the distance), and I know that. For whatever reason, I just can't stop myself for caring so much. She texts me, and I'll get really happy. She won't text me and my mind will race why she isn't. (She didn't reply yesterday to a text and nothing at all today until just a bit ago.) And that messed with me way more than I feel like is acceptable. 

I'm naturally inclined to say to myself, oh it's a rebound. But I'm smart, I'm an adult. This really isn't a rebound, at least in terms of the relationship/girl. I'm not lowering my standards at all for her. She's got so many qualities I really really like. She's smart, got a great career, went to a great school, she's beautiful, the sex was great, we have great chemistry... Maybe this is some sort of emotional rebound for me and I'm just having trouble dealing with a woman again. I built myself back from nothing, so maybe this is messing with me. But I can't help myself from caring so much about something that doesn't seem to necessitate this much care. We aren't dating. But why do I care so much about every little thing? 

Does anyone else have this problem? And way to get past it? Any way to help not care so much and not let this girl run my mind?

so why is she suddenly in love with him? bf says that she's crazy and apparently her last bf just dumped her so she's grasping at straws trying to find another relationship. he says he feels like he has to be nice to her because she's unstable/depressive and he doesn't know what she'll do, and is hoping she'll go away on her own. so he can verbally abuse and cheat on her, but he can't politely say I'm not getting back together, please leave me and my family alone. ??? makes NO sense to me. he's worried that she'll kill herself if he goes no-contact even though she obviously didn't kill herself over him gloatingly cheating on her or constant name-calling while they were together, or after they dumped eachother like 5 times.

i asked him point blank, would you get back together if you weren't with me? trying to figure out if he still has feelings for her and he said it's none of your business what i would do if we weren't together, why does it even matter. that felt like a really defensive response. so, i finally told him i've had enough of her constant calls, voicemails and emails to him &amp; his mom, and told him: tell her to piss off or i'm leaving. so he tensely called her up and said please don't message me on facebook, it's causing problems. and then hung up. it felt like he was saying MlSHKA is mad at me, lay off a little when it should have been I do not want to get back together, stop contacting me and my family. he said, again, he has to be nice because he doesn't know what she'll do, as if she's going to kill herself if he enforces no-contact. and that she'll go away on her own eventually. what the hell?

what should i do, what should HE be doing, and does his behavior sound weird/fishy to anyone else?

Here's the deal. I'm 20 years old. I attended private school in a HS that was so tiny my graduating class was 5 including myself. I've always been academically focused. I will graduate college this year due to pushing so hard. And lately I've come to regret it all. I can count the parties I went to on one hand and never attended many social events. All my friends have been in this aggressive lifestyle as well. (I've been friends with them do 4 years they range in age 21-24) 


Lately my regret has made me rethink my wants in life. My entire life my parents but mainly my father has played a tremendous role. Even today he provides me with everything I need, but in return he has this control over me that I hate. He can cut me off at anytime if I don't follow his rules. This has led me to be more independent. I've never really done anything. I've never left the country or been to a dance, sporting event, or anything normal people my age have done! it's been all books! 


I was suppose to apply to law school but I recently broke the news to my parents I'd be getting a master 1st just so I'll have more time to relax and have fun maybe even travel a little. In my mind the next few years will be great, but in my relatives and friends mind I'm being immature. My parents want me to pursue a law degree ( doable) and get married ( no way) within the next 5 years. All my friends are in serious relationship planning on tying the knot soon and getting jobs. I had no problem with my parents disagreement cause I expected it but a recent conversation with my friends had me in tears


I live in the Deep South now. I moved here from the north not too long ago and boy what a difference. I feel like every girls dream is to be barefoot, pregnant, married, and cooking in some mans kitchen. They go to college to seek husbands and marry after graduation. I'm generalizing of course but that's what it seems the pattern is. HS-&gt; College-&gt; Husband-&gt; kids. Recently I told my friends I wanted to wait till at least till I was 25 to get married and I wasn't sure if I wanted kids and they flipped! Saying  you don't have to worry about marriage because no man would marry I women who didn't want to have kids What a waste of what God put you on earth for! You're a women your suppose to marry and have children. I mean kids are a possibly I love children but I'm just uncertain! I feel so stupid since they are my age and so sure! My father also doesn't believe in just letting me be. He thinks he's suppose to take care of me until I marry then my husband will. Is that normal? 

When I tried to explain to them I wanted to travel and become a better person before marriage bc I felt I was to young they thought I was insulting them. I tried to say I wanted a few more degrees and life experiences before settling down they gave me this whole omg you and this independent women crap! I would to submit to my husband I see nothing wrong with it but I'm just breaking my fathers grip the thought of marrying a man and being under certain lifestyle restrictions seems intolerable. I don't mean my husband would control me but going to a bar getting drunk flirting all that would be off limits and I'm 20....


Now I've slept and dated some guys but I've made it clear I have no intentions on becoming their gfs and getting married any time soon. I try and keep the same FB for a year so my numbers rather low but it always lead to them wanting a bigger commitment and giving me an ultimatum. I got proposed to at 18 and I laughed thinking he was crazy only to turn around and have my bf get proposed to at 18 as well and accept! The guys usual get mad call me a whore. But am I because I'm not ready for commitment? Now that my friends know I don't want to be married they question every guy I talk to saying, what's the point leave him for someone who's mature enough for a real relationship! One girl even said if you're going to be future driven be just that! Don't be a whore! Focus on school if you have time to screw around you have time for real dates! 


I feel horrible! Like I'm not fulfilling my womanly deputy or something. I feel like I might be a whore for sleeping with men who I had no intentions of dating or marrying even if my number is low. However I read an article that the Bible Belt states have a higher divorce rates than northern states. Reason behind this have  thought to be women getting married younger and  a lack of education. 


So what do you guys think? I'm not this super independent women! I'm just curious to what's out there! I want the lifestyle my family and friends want just later down the line! What should I do? Please give me advice on how to handle my friends and family! I've considered just getting into a long term open relationship just to shut people up...but that wouldn't make me happy.

A lot of issues were involved  and he has since taken care of some of them as in getting his life in order. Though he admits to his issues, he has yet to get serious help for them.

Since things have been going ok, I thought we could go back to being friends on Facebook but now he has hidden it where I can not 'friend' him. Not everyone just me. I also see that he is still 'friends' with the girls he cheated on me with. Him hiding things from me on Facebook and hiding my posts on his wall to his friends had been going on during our relationship. I eventually just let it go because we seemed happy but as evidently he has hiding something then too. He claimed much of what happened in the past had to do with this issues and he wanted to change. 

After I asked him about this today, he got mad at me for getting into an argument over Facebook. I think all of this is silly too but I just want to be able to have a normal relationship that we can be happy about and share with people we love. I don't want it to always be a big thing if I want to share pictures or something. Him hiding things still seems like a huge trust wall he is putting up.

11925,Relationships,2v81b9,"I might be wrong about some of the facts in this story but it's everything I think happened.


A little backstory:


About 5 years ago I dated this girl (let's call her Mary) in high school. We were the perfect couple, never fought, never got tired of seeing each other, she even took my virginity. It was great.


But I fucked up. I decided I wanted to go mess around with other people so the relationship ended. We ended up being friends again about a year later since we had the same friend-group, and of course that led us to sleeping with each other multiple times. Well she started seeing this guy (his name is Taint. Fuck Taint.) and I started seeing this girl (name not important) but we were still sleeping together occasionally.


Fast forward two years. We were no longer sleeping together, but one drunk night I texted her out of the blue and ended up going over to her house to hang out. She's still with Taint but I'm single and I'm quite drunk, I don't remember exactly what happened that night but I think we smashed uglies. Again I'm not sure. It's definitely *more* than possible but, you know, drunk.


Here's the fun part: 9 months later she has a kid.


I hear through mutual friends that Taint took some sort of paternity test and everyone thinks it's mine. Several people think it's another guy's (call him Orange). I'm maybe 95% sure it's not Taint's kid, and ~35% sure it might be mine. I'm a little fuzzy on the timeline. But my most recent ex was upset about how much the baby looked like me.


So now it's today.  I've been in a relationship for the past two years that recently ended and of course me and Mary have been talking, sending pictures, flirting, etc. Taint is still in her life in a big way but they're not dating. I went over there one night and met her kid, and once she was asleep me and Mary had a few drinks and eventually started making out a bit. We didn't go all the way or anything but ever since that night she's been slightly distant.


I'm not even sure there's a real question here. I just want to know what the hell to do. I will always have feelings for this girl and she told me she'd always have feelings for me. I don't know if shes still in love with Taint or not, it seems like she might be. I'd like to at least give it a shot but I don't know what to say. I don't want to come across as needy or anything but I really want to see her.


This whole situation is weird and I don't want to use her as a rebound from my relationship but I also don't want to miss my window of opportunity.

11926,Relationships,2d9uvk,"We have been together for a year. This relationship is better than anything I could ever imagine. We are extremely close and pretty much living together at this point. There are two different things that have been bugging me A LOT lately:

1) He has been sober for 3 years, which I have absolutely no problem with. He frequently attends AA meetings. 

Well recently, his ex-girlfriend texted him to make amends since she had previously ended things with him on a bad note.

I get that this is part of the 12 steps but I'm still so uncomfortable with this. I don't want them meeting up and rehashing the past. He's going to do it anyway. I've made clear to him that I'm not ok with it.

2) He's currently volunteering on a political campaign. Well, apparently part of his job description is sending out anonymous e-mails in which he reveals some dirt on the other person running. He even downloaded Tor to do so.

I am disgusted by that! I can't believe this sweet guy I'm in love with would want to do such a thing. I'm really disappointed but he's assured me that this comes with the territory. That makes me feel even worse since he's pursuing a career doing this kind of thing.



So, I don't know what to do. I've addressed each of these issues individually but his attitude has been pretty much that's how it is, deal with it. We are getting pretty serious and these are two huge parts of his life which make me incredibly uncomfortable sometimes. What can I do?

It's been an uphill struggle with me recently as I've been suffering from depression, its been building up over the last month. I've rarely seen my girlfriend and the one weekend we see each other is at a friends party. Naturally I wanted to tell her how I was feeling but she thought I was ignoring her because whenever she'd ask if I was okay, I'd say I'm okay when really I was too afraid to tell her.


I had been drinking after she left early and texted her, of course, and she replied with a massive rant over everything I did wrong that night. I have a real problem when I comes to opening up as I get anxious, so I wrote her a letter that I could read her so my words wouldn't get so muddled up. One problem is she never has time for me anymore, I'm told that if you like someone you should make time for them anyway but I'm not forcing her to make time for me.


Another problem is that she goes completely silent after these things occur when we should be communicating and I drives me crazy and I get frustrated because she never responds, I've found out recently that I've fallen in love with her which is a huge problem because I overthink these things and just suspect she'll want to split up.

11930,Relationships,23lo4c,"Hey /r/relationships I really need some help, or insight, or something. My 7 year anniversary just came up with my girlfriend, and we've been together since high school, but I don't think I can do it any more. I'll start with a little background on each of us and then go into the relationship details just to give you guys a full perspective.

First my girlfriend: She's 21, finishing college, isn't exactly a social butterfly with a ton of friends, she's done dance since she can walk, and she has both Type 1 diabetes and Chrons disease.

Myself: 22, college graduate, working full-time, I travel about 50% of the year for work, I have 3 best friends and a good amount of friends/acquaintances, totally healthy and like to stay active, used to play baseball, football, wrestled, and played rugby in college. 

We started dating when I was 15 and she was 14. I knew back then that she had diabetes and that it would be a life long commitment to testing blood sugar and a proper diet for her. Her parents were always on top of her about testing her blood and it was never and issue.

After a few years I went away to college and we took our first break at the end of my fall semester. I felt like I needed to experience college and being single seemed more honorable than just doing things behind her back. We were only separated for a few months when her grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. Since we were still talking and fairly close I was there to support her and after a few weeks together and at the hospital we got back together.

During her freshman year at college she was diagnosed with Chrons disease, which is another life long commitment to proper diet and medication in order to maintain it. After the initial flare up she went into remission for the next couple years and it was a non-issue. Until recently where she had another flare up and has been battling with her stomach for the last 6 months. Which has resulted in a huge decline in bedroom activity, to the point where I can't even touch her sometimes. And when I do try to initiate anything there's no reciprocation. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't even want to do anything with me and sex has become a chore. I don't even know when she's in the mood any more and so I practically have to ask if she wants to have sex because suggestive touching/kissing doesn't even get the ball rolling. 

Since I've graduated and started working we've been talking more seriously about our future. Moving in together, getting married, having kids, but I'm starting to become more and more nervous about our future. As a result of going away to college and being on her own she's really neglected her diabetes and has not been testing her blood when she's supposed to, if at all!

For me this has become a bigger and bigger issue as the diabetes already makes pregnancy complicated for both her and the child. I've tried having very calm, well thought out, conversations about her being more responsible for testing her blood. I've tried explaining to her that I fear the consequences of neglecting her disease and don't want to end up losing her to complications during pregnancy, complications with a child, or the other inevitable results of not taking proper care of yourself when you have diabetes (kidney damage, heart disease, blindness, nerve damage, etc). And yet she still doesn't test when she's supposed to and doesn't take it seriously.

I understand that she's also dealing with the stress (physical and emotional) of her Chrons flare ups, but at times when it is under control there is no reason (in my opinion) that she can't take those few seconds a day to test her blood before each meal.

It's gotten to the point where I feel she isn't looking at the long term effects of not getting her diseases under control today. For me this has become something I think about every single day and whether or not I can put up with this much longer. If she can't be responsible for managing her diabetes herself, then how can we have kids that may also potentially have diabetes and expect them to be responsible when their own mother can't even do it. 

I love her, but I don't think I'm in love with her any more. It may seem selfish, but I don't think I can stay with her for the sake of my future. I haven't done this yet, but I've considered telling her that if she can't prove to me that she can take care of herself and test her blood when she's supposed to then I can't be with her. I don't want to give her an ultimatum, but I feel like it's really the last opportunity for her to prove that she can be responsible for herself and a future with her is a possibility. And it's not that I don't want to be supportive, but I won't always be right next to her every time she goes to eat to remind her to test her blood, it's just not possible.

I really don't know what to do and I feel like I'm losing out on some of my youth.

Too little too late is a good way to sum up my intentions. I didn't handle it well at all. I flipped out, more or less tormented her and the girl, and didn't actually get to no contact for way longer than I should have. 

Yesterday she called me out of courtesy to not hear it second hand or find them in person to tell me she is seeing a man. My initial reaction wasn't good and I started to ask questions I would torture myself with the answers to but caught myself before I got obsessed. Its cool. If someone else can make her feel how I should have made her feel then good for her, at this point I want her to be happy. I told her I was trying to get NSA sex with a stranger on craigslist and made a dating profile and she flipped out on me. 

I know its never going to work now. I know we can't even handle being friends. It just sucks. I look at these girls on the dating sites and feel nothing. They don't have the perfect lips and cheeks and eyes and hair she does. I think about having casual sex with someone and feel disgusted. I'm not attached like I was, but I know I'm not ready for someone else in any capacity. A part of me felt like just getting it over with and having sex with someone new would help speed the process up, but it looks like its just going to be agonizing.

I've been doing better lately. I've been keeping myself distracted with lots of books, new hobbies, learning things, hanging out with friends every night, exercise, drinking less, etc. But then there are nights like this where I'm home alone and just don't feel like going out. I've always been a homebody and need some time to just be in the house sometimes. But I would do anything to just cuddle with her and enjoy a movie or something. I think about her doing something like that with this other man and it really sucks. I'm trying to see it as she is just finding her own happiness and if I TRULY love her I should appreciate her quest for it. But it just sucks. I don't obsess over a mental image or anything, I just feel lonely and I don't know how to let myself try to not. Am I not supposed to feel that ready yet? Does it just take months? I'm a person who heavily revolves around physical affection and cheap sex isn't going to get me that. 

I guess I'm just super lonely tonight and could use someone to chat with. My only friends that aren't busy tonight are either far away or raging alcoholics and I don't feel like drinking. What input or advice do you guys have? How is your night going? What have you been up to? Anything is appreciated.

He knows how old I am because it came up naturally when I was telling him a story about my 21st birthday, which was recent. He said, Oh, so you're 21? and I said yes and casually asked how old he is. He told me to guess, so I said 26, because I thought that might be possible? He looks like he could be anywhere between 25-35 but I'm honestly pretty bad at guessing ages. From the way he acts, I'm pretty positive he's over the age of 25. From what he's told me, he's pretty successful and has started and sold his own business already and he definitely looks too old to be my age. After I guessed a bunch of times he started laughing and kinda teasing me about how badly I wanted to know. I know it doesn't matter that much, but him keeping it from me just made me want to know more so I kept guessing. He eventually just started saying he wasn't gonna tell me because he thought it was so funny that I wanted to know so badly. He seems to like the power of having info that I don't have. 


Anyway, I tried to get the info in other ways. For example, I asked what year he graduated college when he told me a story about his college days. He caught on and said something like, oh no, you're not getting it out of me that easy. So now he basically refuses to tell me because it's funny to him. I told him I seriously wanted to know, and I thought it was straight up weird that he wouldn't tell me. But he still treated it like a joke. 


Is this a red flag? I feel like it's not that funny of a joke and it's kinda weird that he thinks of it that way. I know age isn't that big of a deal since we're both adults and have fun together, but it's still weird that he won't tell me. I genuinely want to know now. Or am I just making too big of a deal about this? Thoughts?

11936,Relationships,3etf8q,"First a little about myself: When it comes to the honesty/sensitivity dichotomy, I have always believed in honesty first. Not to the point of being brutal, but honesty is essential in any relationship. If you cannot be honest with each other because you're too afraid of hurting the other, where does that leave you?

On top of that, I was raised in a family where feelings were the opposite of celebrated. If you couldn't get your emotions under control and stop crying in 0.2 seconds, you were made to go on a run or clean the house or something. (I have made progress in this area in trying to accept my emotions instead of suppressing them, though I'm nowhere near where I should be.)

I have always prided myself on both of these: being able to be honest and take honesty without being hurt or offended, and being able to keep myself under control and not be a typical emotional girl.

On top of that, I do not subscribe to the idea of love as emotions. The emotions are fun, sure, but they can also be confusing and misleading. Love is ultimately a choice. When the emotions fade, which they inevitably will because no emotion lasts forever (not that you can't rekindle them), do they still choose you? Do they still choose to put you and your feelings above their feelings and desires? That is the ultimate expression of love, imo.

A little bit about my relationship: I have been in love with him for over 2 years now, and he's pretty sure he has loved me for longer than I have loved him, and we have been best friends for all of that time. However, due to a number of factors, we did not express mutual interest in each other until December of last year, and did not start dating until February of this year.

In part because of this, I had spent a long time telling myself he didn't like me and never would, giving myself reasons why it could never work out to convince myself to move on, etc. When we did start dating, it felt surreal. But it didn't take long for all those reasons I had given myself that we couldn't work out to make an appearance in my thoughts again.

I became afraid that if he hadn't noticed these before or hadn't thought they were as big of a deal as they as I thought they would be to him, then he would definitely notice now. For the first couple months of our relationship, every time he brought up a serious topic of discussion, I was immediately afraid that he was breaking up with me for all of these problems that only existed in my head.

Also a little about him: Until fairly recently (probably about February), he was incredibly emotionally repressed to the point of not being able to feel anything. This is something he has been figuring out about himself with the help of his friend [40'sM] who is also a therapist/life coach. He has made incredible progress in this area to the point where I think that of the two of us, I'm the emotionally repressed one now.

Since then we have come a long way. We are both very serious about each other, helping each other to make it on our own (just finishing up school and trying to figure out how to live without moving back in with parents type thing). We have discussed the future of our relationship and both said that we want to eventually get married, understanding that we both view marriage as a serious, lifetime commitment. We're not trying to be reckless or starry-eyed. We are both very practical, down to earth people who mostly do not act on emotions and who are very committed to each other. After 2 years of being best friends, there was not much either of us did not already know about the other.

In some of our many conversations, we have discussed the topic of jealousy and fidelity. In keeping with the idea that I like to pretend to have everything together emotionally, I also don't ever want to be the jealous girlfriend. I do not have a problem with him having friendships with other females. I do not feel the need to check up on him or what he is doing. I trust him completely. I have never doubted that he loves me and acts in my best interest even above his own. He has proven this multiple times.

And I do not like jealous guys at all. I have other guy friends, and I want my significant other to respect that and trust me. And he does. He is in no way jealous or insecure. He does not question me or my relationship with them ever. His fear related to this is not that I would cheat on him (he would forgive me and still love me), but that I would feel so guilty about it I would think there was no way he could still love me and I would leave him. Which, knowing myself, is not an improbable response if I ever were to cheat on him.

But we both decided that no matter what, we wanted to be open and honest with each other, want to be able to talk about things and discuss them openly. He wanted to know what kinds of things would make me jealous, how to bring up something that could make me jealous, how to respond to me if I were to bring up something I was jealous about, etc.

A couple weeks ago, he left to go on a retreat with his friend (the therapist/life coach) out of the country without internet. While there, he got to know one of his female acquaintances very well and they grew very close. When he returned to the US on Saturday, he talked to me about her and said that he had been thinking about kissing her for the last 3 days of the retreat, that he decided against it, and that he felt very confused and conflicted about it.

Despite wanting to be okay with everything and not wanting to be jealous or insecure, it hurt a lot. I've been struggling with it all weekend. I keep crying and I don't even know why. He didn't do anything. He specifically chose not to because of me. That fits my definition of what I have always believed love to be. I cannot deny that either or both of us will have feelings for other people at some point in our lives, right? That's human. And should I not be happy that he would come to me with this instead of trying to hide it? Doesn't that say something? So why am I taking this so hard and what should I do about it?

   
tl;dr: My boyfriend admitted to me that he had/has (not quite sure) conflicting feelings about another girl.

11937,Breakups,3dy5b8,"My ex-gf [21 F] broke up with Me [25 M] over facetime after returning home from study abroad in another country. She was there for 5 months during which we hit our 1 year and her birthday. I mailed her a very nice custom made necklace ($600) and a long hand written letter as a gift for her birthday and our anniversary.

She broke up with me two weeks ago over facetime when she returned from her trip. Our relationship was already LDR before she left for study abroad and she decided she didn't want to do it anymore when she got back. It was nothing against me and she wanted to break up with me in person but couldn't keep pretending for another month or two before I'd get to see her in person. I understood, I wouldn't want to drive hours to visit her just to be dumped any way.

Now, we talked for about an hour after she broke up with me. We had both discussed the relationship before and as much as we loved being with eachother we both knew there was no real future. Still, I thought, and was looking forward to the relationship lasting for probably another year while she finished school (her school is very near my parents home which made visiting her easy). I told her I thought she was making a mistake doing this before we even got to see eachother in person again to rekindle what we had. But her mind was set and I respected her decision. So there was no hard feelings on the break up and we still care about eachother very much it just wasn't the right circumstances for us.

So I brought up the necklace I had bought her when she broke up with me. Told her I felt like an idiot for buying such an expensive and then getting dumped, when I didn't even give it to her in person or get to see her wear it. She said she'd give it back if I wanted and I told her I'd think about it. Well after we got off the phone, texted her a few hours later before I went to bed and said, Would you please send me the necklace. *my address* She said, Sure Then, I felt bad having that be the last thing I sent her so two days later I said, I'm actually glad we broke up. We had many great times together but it's the right decision and for the best :) She responded by saying, Glad you feel that way. I sent this to be on better terms with her as I know I will likely see her again when I visit my parents this fall since she is so close. But until then, for at least a couple months I do not plan to contact her at all, and respond very briefly and casually if she contacts me first.

It's been two weeks and I still haven't received the necklace. She's very punctual and responsible so I' find it strange the necklace hasn't showed up in my mailbox yet. I just want some opinions on why she hasn't returned this necklace when she agreed to. Thanks.

My boyfriend is a horticulturalist that works for the government. He was gone most of June and all of July doing field work. I thought I would miss him, but I actually didn't. At all. I seemed to have a total 180 change in behavior. I started going to bed at a reasonable time and getting up early rather than staying up late and sleeping in. I was keeping on track with my homework (I'm currently in school working towards a masters/doctorate in Biology) as well as keeping on top of household chores. School no longer felt overwhelming, I didn't feel like quitting, I didn't want to lay in bed watching netflix all day, my place looked (and smelled!) lovely!

He's been back for a week, and I literally feel drained and I think it's because I spend too much time with him. We spend anywhere between 2 to 4 days/nights together and I honestly feel that 1 day a week is enough and 2 is pushing it. We always spend time at his house because he's allergic to my cat. I can't do homework at his place because he is constantly distracting me. He'll be ok for like an hour or so, but then it's like, 'hey check this out,' or 'wanna play a game?' or he'll start trying to put the moves on me for 'sexy time' which is a whole 'nother issue because sex is the last thing on my mind. If I'm at his place I can't just be there doing my own thing, I have to be there doing something with him. I just don't have the energy to put towards a relationship right now. I don't want to be thinking about someone else, or arranging dates with someone, or rearranging my work/school schedule to spend time with someone. 

Since he's been back, between him and work I've been so tired and depleted. As a result I have no motivation/energy to do anything else so I'm behind on school work again and my place is a mess. I feel like I only have the energy to concentrate on school, work, and chores. I have nothing left over for a relationship. He says he understands when I tell him I'm busy with school/work, but he is constantly pressuring me to spend time with him. This weekend he wants to go camping. CAMPING! I would love to go camping but I don't have time! This semester is ending in two weeks, I have two finals to study for on top of working 32 hours at a stressful job AND trying to fix my broken down car. I start a new semester at the beginning of September with an even more challenging course load, and I am dreading the thought of having to worry about him on top of everything else. I feel like a relationship shouldn't add to my stress! It should take some away!

We have talked previously before about these issues but he just doesn't seem to get it. If I tell him I'm only free during this certain time I get a :/ emoti-con response (literally, that's what he will text me). Maybe it's because he's more extroverted and needs more people time than my introverted self does. He has a lot of friends, but none of them live here. They are all two hours away back home. We live in a small and conservative town, it's difficult to find people to hang with here.

11939,Breakups,30s0o5,"I've never posted before and have been lurking around this subreddit trying to find something similar to my current situation. With no luck, I've taken the plunge. I apologise for this being a little long.


A little background:

I met my bf last year at Uni, we hit it of straight away and it was obvious that we really liked one another. It then came to light that he was in a LDR with a girl for 2 years who had been causing him a lot of grief. 


Whenever he mentioned the topic of them breaking up, she would threaten him with self-harming and other crazy and irrational actions which stopped him from doing so. Long story short, it was clear that he was deeply unhappy and we were both intent on having a relationship so we got together before they technically broke up.

Current situation:

Before I go on, I want to make it clear that this man is the only one I’ve met whose personality has been so in tune with my own. He’s an intelligent and very patient man who shares all the same interests and beliefs as I do. I’ve met his family, stayed at his place for extended periods of time and learnt to love everything about him. He pushes me to be a better person and do the best I can, all without being too forceful. We hardly ever argue and when we do, it’s very trivial. All I can say is that it’s been the most wonderful relationship and it’s the sort that I want to have for many years to come.


Now, I realise that for me to get with him when he was technically still in a relationship was a huge mistake on my part. It's left me with massive trust issues after discovering that not only did he cheat on his ex with me but also with his flatmate when he was black-out drunk. He was also talking to an old flame inappropriately prior to this.


We’ve spoken a lot about my fears and doubts and he has told me how much he loves me and wants it to work. He shows sincere guilt for his actions and said he feels that he respects our relationship and so would sit me down and break up with me if he were ever unhappy.


With only a few months to go till we graduate, I’m worried. He has got back in touch with this old flame that I mentioned earlier and, despite there being nothing sexual going on, he hasn’t mentioned that he has a new girlfriend. After asking him, it also turns out that despite him initially telling me that he was no longer in love with his ex, he told her he loved her whilst we were getting together.


I don’t know if my insecurities are running riot here but I’m worried he’s going to do the same to me. He can’t handle his alcohol and gets black out drunk which leads to poor decisions. I’m reaching out to you all as I need to know an outside perspective. Have I been looking through rose-tinted glasses this entire time or am I justified in believing in him?

A friend of mine and his girlfriend had a child together a few years ago; they live together but are not married.  Their relationship ground to a halt a while ago.  She is still living in his house as she has nowhere else to go, but they barely talk to each other.  Awful atmosphere but they manage to keep things civil for the sake of their daughter who they both adore.  They are finally making moves to separate and apparently she has gotten her dad to pay for a solicitor to get involved, I'm not sure of the details but presumably to set-up child maintenance payments.  My friend is not the kind of person who is going to leave his child destitute.  I can't help feeling she is going overboard here.

11941,Relationships,32i8n1,"Hello, first time poster here.

I am in a relatively happy, but very unique relationship, that has just taken a  bad turn tonight. I am seeking some advice.

We've been together for about 10 months now, and have surely had our ups and downs, but are happy with one another. We met at work, and we started our relationship as friends. She was new to work, and was from a different state. I was instantly attracted, but she let it be known to everyone that she was married. 

Well, over time, people started finding out that perhaps the marriage was not all that legitimate. She is American, but has dual-citizenship and has spent many years living and studying where her parents are from. Despite my interest in her, this is not something I decided to pursue.

One day, on a slow day at work, she started showing real interest in me. A few evenings later we went out for drinks, and then it progressed. At that point in time, I knew of her marriage and the rumors surrounding it, but had not heard from her own mouth the reality of the situation, so I decided to ask. She explained to me that she was pretty much doing this guy a favor, as good friends, because his and her home country did not have the kind of opportunities as America. In a way, I admired her for the willingness to change someone's life for the better, all while risking her own legalities.

It is important to note that my s/o and her husband live together, with another roommate. I got my own apartment so our relationship could progress and so we could spend more time together as a couple.

As time progressed, I expressed some apprehension to her about the whole situation just because it was kind of weird and so unorthodox. She told me not to be concerned, and invited me over to meet the husband. Despite the sleight language barrier, I enjoyed being able to meet him and gained some peace of mind.

From that point on, I was at ease about the situation and really did not give it much thought.

Until just this evening...
I decided I was going to surprise my s/o at work and sit in her section so she could be my waitress, since I had the night off. I arrive, and her roommate was already sitting in her section waiting on some carry-out food. I decide to sit down with her and chat. Her roommate is an old friend of her's who shares the same nationality, speaks the same language, and knows pretty much everything about my s/o. For whatever reason, we get to talking about the marriage and I find out that my s/o and her husband used to be in a relationship, and I was never informed. I could not believe what I was hearing. My s/o had so many opportunities along the way to let me know this important little tidbit, but had completely neglected to do so. At this point, I feel betrayed. I am angry and don't really know how to react or where to go from this point. Any advice or insight would be appreciated.

And he's very much into me.

BUT, I am completely put off by guys who seem really enthusiastic about me in a romantic context. I really find it off-putting and it's getting in the way of me dating him! He texts me constantly, will randomly send me messages about how beautiful my eyes are, how much he misses me, referring to me as love and beautiful, bringing up children, asking about my opinions on marriage etc. Something I couldn't even consider saying until I knew someone extremely well. I want to like it... But I really don't! Even the constant compliments make me anxious and guilty.

We are also coworkers, and before I knew his family was wealthy, I kind of figured out they were or at the very least Austin made a lot more money than I did. He goes out for lunch all the time, he just bought a model year car whose price put me into sticker shock, and he golfs as his #1 hobby (I admit it’s stereotyping golf as the “rich man’s sport”, but it fit.) I didn’t think anything of it because hey, it’s his money, he can do whatever he wants with it and he could be going home and eating ramen every night for all I know to afford a new car, lunch, etc. 

Then, a coworker I’m fairly close with was randomly Googling people in the office to see what came up, and when she typed his name, a bunch of stuff about his father came up. Long story short, his father is seriously, overwhelmingly rich. It certainly explained some things about Austin’s spending habits, but it wasn’t a big deal at the time.

I was super surprised when he asked me out. He’s kind of the life of the office and I’m...not, but we’ve always had this back and forth flirty banter going since we met. He’s the type of person that brings me out of my shell, so I’m way less introverted around him, which is how we got to talking and how we got closer. 

We’ve only been on a few dates, and I’ve offered to pay for things and he always insists on paying for everything. Even if it’s just the tip at the restaurant or concessions at the movies, he’ll go, “I invited *you*, I’m not going to make you pay for anything.” It makes me a little uncomfortable at times because I want to at least contribute, and he won’t let me, and I *know* why he’s not letting me, but he doesn’t know that I know. 

He told me he would be going to something at a hotel in a few weeks and asked me to be his date, to which I said of course. I’m pretty new to the area I’m working in (long commute) so I didn’t know the hotel was one of the fancier ones until after I looked it up. I also looked at past pictures of the events, and the women are wearing extremely nice dresses. The last time I wore anything that nice was prom, and even then my prom dress probably wasn’t on par. Austin kind of jokingly offered to go dress shopping with me, but I turned him down so I could surprise him. I know he’d want to pay for the dress, which I can afford this once, but if he does this stuff all the time I’m not sure I’ll be able to. I really don’t want him to pay for everything for me, as I’m pretty independent, but I’m not sure I can just drop a ton of money on a new dress every time he goes to one of these parties. 

I’m not sure if I should tell him I know he’s wealthy or if I should wait for him to tell me. I know why he hasn’t mentioned it to me yet because of every rom-com ever made, but if I let him know will he think of me as a gold digger? Reddit, what do I do?

While our relationship might have had a few negative quirks, we were so compatible and had excellent communication; so when she dropped the news that she couldn't come to terms/peace after 8 months with having a potential father-in-law in prison and him having a record, she decided to do a full stop and end the relationship right there, but still wants to remain best friends.

I was in shock because she never told me about this until then. As most relationships seem, on the surface things were going fantastic. But I could tell she was uneasy about something, I just didn't know what it was.  She told me at the start that she doesn't date if there's not any long-term investment. I was prepared to do long-term with her and I thought that was the game plan.

I still love her and don't know what to do. My dad won't be out until the summer next year. When her parents came to visit she seemed at ease with me, but I could see the internal conflict with her mom. 

I can say that the romantic relationship is over, but I don't even know if I should remain friends with her after this. I was hurt and heartbroken that she'd judge someone she's never met before. 

This was her first relationship ever and my first long-term serious one.

11947,Relationships,3g8rnu,"So this never happened to me before. I have a wonderful relationship with my girlfriend, we support each other, we are having an amazing time and we are very in love.
Yesterday I didn't have to go to Uni, I'm changing careers so this period of time I'll be staying a lot more at home. I don't live with my GF, but we both live alone, so we spend much time together.
The day started well, I was staying longer at home before I see her because I had some homework to do and I wanted to finish it ASAP, we planned to go to a free music festival but we weren't quite sure.

So I decided I'd finish my homework and then I'd go see her. Having pretty much and entire day for my own, I decided I would prepare some weed brownies and have a nice, chill day at home. It backfired, and I never felt that way before. When the time to go visit her came, I wasn't controlled whatsoever. My head was spinning, each thought came like in a roullette. Tons of variations of the same thoughts I had appeared, each one with it's own phrasing, context and intentions. I wasn't any capable of connecting two sentences together and giving any sense to what I was saying. It was horrible and I had an awful time, but I really treated my girlfriend poorly.

It wasn't my intention, and many things I said weren't true, it's just that these brownies really left me without any of my emotional intelligence,. I was feeling many things at the same time and, in the end, it wasn't me. I made her cry and I hate myself for that, but anytime I tried to make things better I made them worse. I couldn't communicate myself.

Now, I suppose she's forgiven me, I know I made a horrible thing to her, but I didn't want to. It wasn't my plan to ruin the day, I didn't want things to go that route but I was out of myself. I am apologizing each oportunity I have, because things are much more clear now, but how can I cope with it? I feel terrible. 

Edit:

She wrote me this (sorry if it comes off as confusing, we're not native speakers and I had to translate from spanish):

 &gt; OP: I don't pretend that you tell me everything you do or don't, but you don't have to lie to me either. My intentions by constantly asking you about University were to push you to do something, but now I've realized that it doesn't work, so I won't do that anymore. As you said yesterday, it's time you take some responsibility and grow up. I just want you to know that if you don't do this, I won't be able to be with you anymore. I don't want you to promise anything, all the promises you made me; be more responsible, clean, use your time better, look for a house, work out, etc. stayed there. I don't want you to change for me, I want you to change for yourself and because you want to. I love you.

11949,Infidelity,37twtz,"I just wanted the title to be concise. I don't want people to think that I'm hinting at preferring to give up. Please read the post in its entirety. I have summarized as best as possible.

Several months ago, I caught my girlfriend cheating with her ex-boyfriend that she had supposedly broken up with. In doing so, I discovered that most of the things she has ever told me were complete lies.

After giving me a few days to collect my thoughts, she gave me an ultimatum - that I would either forgive her and give her another chance, or she would kill herself.

Especially since she has a history of self-harm and was already self-harming as a way to show repentance, I immediately sought to talk her out of it. I agreed that we could keep in contact, as it was enough to convince her from doing anything drastic. I had previously wanted to cut of all contact, completely.

Since then, we have spoken a lot. She has tried her best to try to fix our relationship and try to become a better person for me. I could give a brief summary of the person she was (probably still is) with a list of points.

- Incredibly promiscuous. This is a HUGE, HUGE understatement. She even asked me out first. I thought, Great! Women should do this more often. (I actually only discovered the extent of her promiscuity much later)


- Very territorial (Hates me interacting with other women)


- Incredibly deceitful (Lies to everyone around her, cheats)


- Ignorance of how the real world works (absolutely no sense of independence; completely dependent on parents)


- Extremely prone to crying and tantrums (Goes hand-in-hand with her deceitfulness, as she uses it to her advantage in manipulating people)

Moving on, she has shown improvements in all of these areas. She tells me that she deeply regrets what she has done, especially to me, and would be willing to do whatever it takes to make things right.

I can tell she really is putting in the effort. I don't want to go into detail because it becomes too revealing, but take my word for it that she is really putting in the effort to show her love to me.

But her past and her cheating is something that I don't know if I'll ever be able to overlook. This is assuming that she would even stop being a liar and a cheater. Every time I tell her this, she insists on putting in more effort to convince me.

I've told her I forgive her, but it still haunts me. I consider myself to be a very honest person, and I was a very trusting person, to the point where it was naive. She betrayed my trust on a level that I'll probably never be able to recover from. Every day I am with her, I am reminded and it kills me. There is always the uncertainty of whether she is being honest to me or not. How could I have a healthy relationship with her ever again?

Ultimately, I want to do what is right. With her ultimatum and the other things she has told me, I am her only chance at redemption and improvement. If I can save a life and improve someone at the cost of my own pain, is it not worth it? She has a loving family that would be crushed if she committed suicide. Even if I don't want this relationship, am I not morally obliged? But my friends all tell me that I should not allow myself to be used this way. I figure they're right, too.

Speaking of my friends, most of them despite her. My friends all think that I'm a very nice person, and they hate that she is seemingly taking full advantage of me. They all advise me to completely cut off all contact from her, and if need be, let her die.

On the contrary, my parents insist that it is more important to potentially save a life than to leave an unhealthy relationship. They are very kind to her despite knowing the things she has done.

What if she is a victim? What if her destructive behavior was/is the fault of something beyond her control? She has told me that she was raped at the age of 13. According to her, I was the first person she told besides a school counselor. Isn't this the sort of childhood trauma that really fucks someone up? All of her terrible behaviors and tendencies are likely all related to that event. Though, she is extremely deceitful and very willing to lie to portray herself in a more favorable light. So I don't know if it's even true, but that would be extremely fucked up to lie about, so I choose to believe her.

But assuming it's true, shouldn't I be more concerned with helping her rather than condemning her? In saying this, I still find it really hard to overlook her past. Her actions have been much more ugly than just cheating on me.

Do relationships ever recover from this sort of damage? Are cheaters able to reform? I always hear otherwise.

To be honest, I'm more concerned with helping her than pursuing the relationship. But if the relationship is necessary to help her, then I'll do it. It seriously sounds like I'm sacrificing a huge aspect of my life for this person. But I'm young and I have time, don't I?

I've always been taught to be a good person and to help others. If I only help others at my own convenience, then I wouldn't be a very good person. And I really don't mind self-sacrifice if it makes a difference for other people.

To clarify, I think I do love her. Though I was utterly convinced that I couldn't ever love her again, I do. That doesn't mean it doesn't pain me to be with her.

I just don't want to end up being utterly disappointed and betrayed, again. That might literally kill me.

11951,Relationships,3emqgg,"My girlfriend Mary and I have been together for almost two years. About six months in, she talked about other kinds of relationships out there, including the poly one. She knows that I have a best friend that is involved with that lifestyle and my best friend even has two girlfriends right now. So I'd happily tell my girlfriend about my best friend's interesting experiences, the good and the bad, and it'd be an occasional conversation.

That part doesn't bother me at all because my best friend is a huge part of my life and it makes sense to talk about it. However, Mary began to talk about how she feels she really understands my best friend's perspective and how she could see it applied to our relationship...that is exactly the point where I feel it's going too far and I try to be open and listen to whatever she has to say but it really makes me uncomfortable because I am very monogamous and I can't help but to feel hurt every time she tries to toy with the idea of introducing poly into our relationship.

She says that she likes the idea of meeting people and experiencing things differently with them. But I just do not like the idea because she's asexual (as in she does not have sex at all...so we do not have sex, we do not do anything sexual except occasional french kisses, that's not even a problem with me, even though I am sexual) so I cannot help but to feel turned off because she claims that she's asexual yet she wants that idea, even though it involves sexual activities with other people. If she's not asexual then that'd make sense.

Also, she gets jealous easily. I learned and navigated through that a lot in the first six months of our relationship. It's not an issue at all. So it bothers me to think that she wants the idea of poly, most likely because of the idea of her meeting people and experiencing typical things with new people is attractive to her and SHE wants to do it. But of course, the whole concept involves BOTH parties going off and seeing other people. So if I do see other people and whatnot, I know she'd have a huge problem with it. So I just feel that she doesn't really like the idea of poly because of US experiencing things with different people, she just likes the idea of HER going off with other people but when it comes to me? No way. That's not what the concept is all about. 

So experiencing things with different people while she's asexual...I think that's the whole point of friendships? There will be no differences..literally. 

How the heck do I approach her about it? I do not want to appear angry but I just DO not like talking about it when it's NEVER happening since I am monogamous (and I'd be willing to explore that idea if she's actually sexual but she's not, so it just seems unfair to me). No point in bringing it up constantly, especially if she doesn't like the idea of me being with other people but completely ok with the idea of herself being with others. If she wants to see other people but keep the idea of asexuality then our visions for our relationship will differ so much by then.

11954,Dating,3hda2v,"This is a short question, I actually wanted to post it on r/askmen but they say we shouldn't post question about someone specific on that sub so here it goes : Would you talk 2 hours on the phone with someone you don't like ?

Backgroung : We spent one summer working together, and yes, there was a lot of chemistry between us (colleagues kept making fun of us, but we both were in a relationship a that time and nothing ever happened). But he moved out of the city at the end of the summer and I saw him only twice since then. We talked a little bit over the phone every months or two months, sometimes more than other times. When we became both singles, we made jokes about the fact that he should come back so we could spend some time together (huh huh). He even drunktexted me two weeks ago, he was in my town, I didn't got his messages, and he wanted to cuddle. Honestly, I hadn't talk to him for 2 months so I told him to fuck off (it was 4am and he was drunk, which is not really appealing, nor really nice for me, I think...). 

Anyway, I may go live in his town for a career opportunity in a near futur (and he's the one I have to thank for that opportunity). The thing is, I know how he makes me feel when I'm aroung him, but don't want to build up my hopes. I'm often the one who wants to talk and when I do, I text him to ask  if he's busy. Then he calls me, and we can speak for hours, even just stay silent on the phone for a few minutes without hanging up. 

I used to talked a lot on the phone with one of my friend (woman) for a few hours, I'm thinking you could do that with a male friend too without this gesture implying you'd want more. Now, I know I love talking with him on the phone, it makes me happy everytime, just to hear his voice. We became friends the summer we worked together and I'm always happy to hear about him. Even before I knew I may have a job near him, I would think of him and KIND OF miss him (I don't miss him but I think of him... its strange cause I still date but, if he texts or calls me.. it's special). 

I feel stupid because it may just be a girl's thinking. I know I call him and can talk to him a lot on the phone because I'm kind of still into him, but... Not quite sure he feels the same.

 Anyways, I rent a bedroom in my house to a young unmarried couple. They are nice and I consider them friends but they are horrible about paying rent on time, cleaning up aftemselves, and basically just pulling their own weight.

I am quite sure that she's the one and we've enjoyed a wonderful start to our relationship. We both are completely open about our past relationships and know a lot of intimate deals about each other's past partners. 



To that end, she's discussed with me her past lovers' penis sizes (ranging from average to quite large) in comparison with my own (charmingly average). This discussion was held at the beginning of our relationship and done more as a getting to know each other exercise than some heated, or debated discussion.



Fast-forward to this past Sunday. I was struggling placing a grip sleeve on my tennis racquet, which is a process much akin to the placing of a condom on a penis. My girlfriend, never having played tennis in her life, interjects that she could do that a lot better. Knowing that she was referring to condoms, I joked with her stating that she hadn't done that in a long time and she was probably out of practice (I knew that she had not used a condom with any of her partners since 2008 or something like that). She laughs and I continue the process.



She continues to suggest that I am doing it wrong and I counter by stating that fitting the sleeve onto the racquet handle is different than what she's alluding to because the fit of the sleeve here is too snug in comparison to a condom with a penis. She then issues the statement at the heart of this post: well maybe not with your penis.



My heart breaks; my testicles recede into the depths of my pelvic region. I'm more or less aloof with her the rest of the day. She apologizes a few hours later after prodding me in regards to the change in my attitude, but her apology consists more of you have no reason to be sad about this you know I love having sex with you. (It may be important to note here that our sex life is fine: we more or less have sex 2-3 times a week, she had her first PIV orgasm with me, etc.)



Unconvinced, my sulking continues. Eventually she becomes angry at me for shunning her for an entire day and for me wanting to go to bed without touching her. She attempts to fall asleep on the couch and after a rousing speech by yours truly decides to move back to the bed. 



I've already told her today that I felt her apology was inadequate and did not address my own hurt ego/feelings. She was contrite and issued the following statement: 

&gt; I'm sorry you still feel emasculated by what I said. feeling sexually undesirable or inadequate is a horrible feeling and I'm sorry to have inflicted that on you.  even though I disagree with your characterization of the joke and my subsequent apology I dont want to argue about it with you.



But alas, I seek your counsel in getting over this statement. I believe the statement was made in jest but still obviously painful. Is this an instance where I just need to man up (so to speak) and move past it?

He gets drunk, like blindingly blackout drunk, and turns into a TOTAL asshole.  Some things he's done include:  threatening to kill me (when he could barely stand up or speak he was so wasted), threatening to call the police on me because he was drunk and I wouldn't give him my car keys (yeah...made no sense then either), calling me every name you can think of (bitch, cunt, whore, worthless, useless, ad infinitum), just generally being a fucking annoying falling down drunk person.  This happens maybe...I dunno, every two or three months?  Maybe a little more often than that, but not much.

We live together (duh), and the lease is in his name, so guess who gets to be homeless if we break up?  I literally have no where to go, and a dog that I will not leave behind for him to do god knows what to to get back at me.  I'm mad at myself for staying this long, that's for fucking sure.

tl;dr:  Drunk boyfriend is shockingly an asshole, and I don't have anywhere to go if I leave him.  My job, my friends, my life, are all here.  What the hell do I do?

Edit:  I don't know if it matters or not, but neither of us have ever been unfaithful (well, I haven't, can't speak for him), I have no desire whatsoever to dig through his phone/computer, and surprisingly no desire to get him to quit drinking.  I just wish the dumb shit he does when he drinks would stop.

I also can't afford my own place up here, with the job I have, I make okay money, but not enough to live alone, that's for sure.  You can guess by my age that most of my friends are married and a lot of them have kids, so it's not like I could stay with them...I really like my job, too, and took it hoping it would lead to bigger and better things.

My girlfriend and I have been together for 1.5 years. I love her and would like to marry her one day when we are ready. About 1 month before we started dating, her father unexpectedly passed away. I have never even lost anyone that I was close at all with. 

Now, all who know her can confirm that they have never met a girl who loved her daddy more than her. Even in his life, she talked about him like he put the stars in the sky. His death was very traumatizing for her, and there are times with the grief suddenly knocks her down again. I do my best to support her.

A huge source of grief for her is that I never got to meet him. She says she wanted so badly to introduce him to me, so that I would know the biggest part of her heart. I had an idea that we could make up an introduction of our own. So over the past few months, she has spent a lot of time going through his stuff and pictures with me, telling me all the stories related to them. We went out to his favorite places to eat. I asked her mom for special recipes her dad used to make her so that I could make them for her as a surprise (which thrilled her to pieces, as I knew it would). She is very open about his death, and loves to talk about him - even though it makes her sad, she says his name is music to her ears. 

The introduction thing worked. She feels like her and I have bonded over the love from her dad. Now, she feels like she is ready and would like to show me his grave. She herself did not even visit his grave until almost a year after his death, so this is a BIG deal. 

I need to do something special for this. Whether I do something, or say something, I just need an idea on how to really solidify the fact that I am happy to have made this connection with her. I really wish I had met her dad, he sounds like a great man who I would have gotten along with really well. I want to show her that.

Does anyone have any advice? Thank you so much.

2 days ago my gf of 3 months tells me that she feels because she and I have been so busy recently, that we should just be friends right now.  This came as a shock to me, as we have never had any problems and just a couple days b4 we were hanging out and everything was good.  
After this we were on the phone a good 3 hours, and its clear she still wants to hang out with me, talk to me everyday (we are going fishing this next weekend and to a concert in a few weeks), ect.. but she feels that her schooling is getting really hard right now, and she's starting her career job, that she feels bad every time she can't hang out with me because of homework and stuff.  Her words included focus on myself not in relationship mode and she said once school is over (about 2 months) we can reevaluate things

I have always been close with my stepmother as we met when I was 5 and she's been like a cool aunt. Very down to earth and fun, whereas my mom is more conservative.

Over the past few years, my father has grown very sick. He was in a coma for a month due to internal bleeding, then he had a brain hemorrhage, then he had open heart surgery, and now he's anemic, wears a diaper, and can't really walk. My stepmother has taken care of him throughout, even though she's only in her 50s.

Last year, she was imprisoned for 6 months. She was involved in a pyramid scheme but didn't know it was illegal. She's honestly not smart enough to know better. While she was away, my dad told me they had an arrangement where he was allowed to date other women for companionship. Part of the agreement was that my stepmom didn't want to know the details.

This kept me quiet for a few months after she was released. Then one night he disappeared from the house and we had to search for him all around town. We were really worried because he's not supposed to drive. I suggested maybe he was meeting up with one of the women he saw while she was away. Turns out she had no idea.

She looked through his email and confronted him. He had been seeing a 33 year old. Yes, someone 45 YEARS YOUNGER than him. He had also been seeing a few other women. He arranged these relationships before my stepmom even left for prison.

Now we are trying to work through this as a family but it's so difficult. We all respected my father so much as this wonderful, intelligent, accomplished man. He was going to be very well taken care of at the end of his life by his loving family. Now he has thrown that all away for some younger woman he couldn't even physically have sex with!

I've been reading a lot about cheating fathers but nothing really mentions elderly, ill cheaters. How do I handle trying to confront him and discuss his transgressions when he looks so pathetic in his bed, unable to take care of himself?

11969,Dating,2mt1ej,"I need dating advice, /r/relationships.

I [28f] should start off by saying that I haven't been in a relationship or even dated that much for about 10 years.  Right after I ended an unhealthy long-term relationship, my sister died, and for years I had no desire to love (and lose) anyone again.  But here I am now, ready to get back out there.

So currently I've been casually seeing this guy, Henry, [38m] for about 6 months.  We've known each other for a couple of years through a group of friends.  

He's a really great guy.  Funny, playful, smart, motivated, successful, 
good moral compass.  Not really my type physically, but he has so many great qualities I found myself liking him more and more.  And he's such a nice guy without a selfish bone in his body.  But there are some aspects of his personality and our relationship that I'm really having trouble understanding and I'm getting frustrated.

Henry's TERRIBLE at communicating and incredibly shy.  I mean, borderline personality disorder kind of shy.  If he finds himself in an uncomfortable social situation he will literally get up and walk away to avoid it (even if it's at a completely inappropriate time).  He can be engaging in a group of people but as soon as something gets awkward or touches on an emotional level he has no idea what to do and gets weird. He's not affectionate physically or verbally, not romantic whatsoever, and doesn't do anything to make me feel desired (except when we're having sex.  But no cuddling after).  I could count on one hand how many compliments he's given me since we've been dating and I'd still have fingers left over.  

I've talked to him about this and he says it's because of his upbringing and him being in the military (he comes from an Asian AND military family.  I don't know if you can get any stricter than that). 

To his credit, the few times I've spoken with him about what's bothering me he's receptive and tries to correct it. He's just so inept and awkward with me sometimes that if he told me he'd never been in a relationship before I would believe him.  I feel like he just doesn't know what to do with me sometimes, if that makes any sense.  If I'm obviously upset about something, he will either be really really nice to me or avoid me altogether - instead of just asking what's wrong.
 
I know that nobody is perfect (certainly myself included) and he has a lot of great qualities.  I guess I'm just wondering... how do I know when I should stick it out and see where it goes or if it's time to move on?  Can someone be in a happy relationship without affection?  I've honestly thought about proposing a FWB deal because I have a high libido and I trust him but I don't think I'll be able to keep my emotions in check.  

I'm grateful for any advice!  Thanks

11970,Relationships,2rh76w,"I have been with my girlfriend for one year. We live together. At the beginning of our relationship she seemed very easy going, always relaxed. We enjoyed drinking together, and had quite a few other common interests. We always had a great time together, and although I could see she was prone to some stress &amp; anxiety, we just clicked, and I felt like I had found someone very special. 



One night she was quite drunk, and at the end of the night, when we got home, she became verbally abusive. I can't remember exactly what she said, but most of it hardly made sense. She was upset that I had let her go to bed without changing into her pyjamas or something. It was quite weird, definitely a different side to her. After about two hours, she eventually calmed down. She never really apologized. 



After being together for 4-5 months, she became moodier and moodier. She would get angry (not abusive, more upset and crying) about many things, some of which contradicted each other. For example, the first time she became really upset with me, she said that we did too much stuff that I wanted to do, and I didn't ask her enough what she wanted to do. So I tried to fix it. A couple of months later she became really upset and told me that I was not enthusiastic enough about organizing things, and that I should be more proactive in suggesting things for us to do. 



Sex has been difficult for us, as she sometimes finds sex painful. She didn't like oral sex when I met her, but now she seems to enjoy it (she can orgasm from it) but she is very often very stiff and looks stressed during any kind of sex. But if we don't have sex at least twice a week, she gets upset and accuses me of not finding her attractive. 



At uni (I am a mature age student) I am the team leader in a big project and I was sending a lot of Facebook messages to group members, organizing stuff for our team. My other group members regularly sent messages through Facebook, so I felt it was important to keep up. One night she got really angry at me for spending too much time writing FB messages on my phone. Ironically, she is very often tapping away on her Blackberry for work. She said that she was afraid I'd become too close to the female members of my group and cheat on her. 



She has been cheated on before by her ex boyfriend. She is extremely jealous. She hates the idea of me having had any past relationships, and gets really uptight if it ever comes up. Although she admits she has a bit of a problem with it, she got very angry when I tried to explain to her my point of view: I believe that it's normal to have had relationships in your 20s (We are both in our early 30s) and I accept that people our age usually have had a few relationships. But she got really angry and said it's fine for me to say, because she doesn't have many ex boyfriends (just two) and that since I would never meet them (because they aren't friends) that I wouldn't have to put my theory to the test. 



Over the 1 year of our relationship, she has probably become flat out abusive 4-5 times. She says things like we might as well break up, that she just can't take it anymore, and that she is so sick of being unhappy. 



One night fairly recently I calmly explained to her that I felt her 'anger-episodes' (the nicest way I could think of to say 'abusive rants') weren't normal. She became very upset for days, but agreed to see a psychologist. I thought it was wonderful. But twice now in arguments she has said that she is seeing a psychologist for me, and has accused me of being ungrateful. 



She went away to overseas for a holiday with her best friend. She had her purse stolen. When I called her, during work (which is hard for me to do) to try to comfort her, she said that I wasn't helping her, and that I was making her feel worse. She gets like this sometimes, really nasty when I am trying to help her when she is upset. Basically if she is sufficiently stressed and upset, she will lash out at me, even though I have done nothing wrong.




When she got upset over New Years Eve because she felt her friends were excluding her, she said that I just kept saying 'yeah' too much, and I wasn't helping. Later on that night, even though I'd been so patient and nice to her, sitting with her and talking calmly, trying to say comforting things, she told me I hadn't given her a cuddle when she needed it, and that she was angry at me about it. 



When we were away with her friends at new years, we had hired a car together. One of her friends asked us if we could go to the supermarket together in our car to pick up groceries and alcohol. She became really angry and sullen because the person asked for a lift to the shops (the nearest supermarket was about a 20 minute drive away) - I was happy to do it, but she was so angry that someone asked for that favor. She said that she didn't want to become everyone's chauffeur. I managed to calm her down and take her friend to the shops. It was no big deal and I was happy to do it. When I got back, she said she was glad she got angry because her friend should at least feel a little bit bad about asking us to drive her to the shops. Personally I felt it was a fairly reasonable request. 



A couple of times, after a big fight, I've thought about trying to end it. She has told me that when her and her ex-boyfriend used to argue, sometimes she'd do crazy things like cut herself. I am a bit afraid that if I left her, she'd do something crazy. She has a very well paid career, but there is a chance that where she works will shut down in the next year, so she is anxious about that - although she is very financially independent, and owns a $0.5 million property (which is almost totally paid off, and she is also renting it out.) So she says she is stressed about her finances / work, but I live hand-to-mouth off my meager part time minimum wage job, which I am doing around university classes. 



I could go on and on. But of course I have outlined all of the worst things she has done over the last 12 months. There are plenty of moments where she is sweet and lovely. Sometimes when I come home she is so excited to see me she jumps up and down with a big smile on her face. She loves to cuddle me in the morning while I am half asleep. She buys me food I like. We love to sit on the couch with a glass of wine and watch TV. We have taken long walks together and just talked about heaps of stuff. We've been to gigs together &amp; have had the best time. She has said she is trying to control her anger, she is seeing a psychologist, and she is trying to take some positive steps. 



But I do feel like she gets upset an unusually large amount. If I had to give a timeline, I'd say she gets somewhat upset / angry 2-3 times a week. Often she'll stare into space for ages, obviously upset, and it takes me 20-30 minutes to coax out of her what is wrong. And then she gets really angry / outright abusive about once a month. Sometimes her 'anger episodes' go on for two or three hours. 



Basically, what I am asking is: Is this behavior somewhat normal? Do people get angry and upset quite a lot in relationships, when they live with someone? In the past I have told myself that this is simply 'what being in a relationship is'. I know it can't be the honeymoon period forever. I have always thought of myself as having a fair, even temperament. I rarely get angry. But lately I've just been losing it. I just can't believe she is upset... again! I feel so stressed out all the time, I'm always worried that I am going to upset her. I feel like she has me whipped into this pathetic little person. 



I feel as though she tends to see that world like: How is the world going to screw me over today? As if, subconsciously, she is always looking for something to be angry about. It is always about how she is put at a disadvantage. 



Sorry this post is so long... it is quite cathartic to get it all down, so thank you for your patience and taking the time to read it.

A bit about us:

Lara 26: I'm not just saying this because I have feelings for her, but Lara is amazing. She is extremely pretty, cool, funny and very intelligent. I'm honestly not exaggerating when I say guys are always after her. Good looking guys too. She has had a lot of boyfriends, and is usually always the one to break it off. In other words, she really is way out of my league. She has an excellent career and loads of friends. Aside from that, she is an amazing friend and the most rational person I've ever met, and a complete weirdo like me.

Tom 28: Tom is Lara's ex and my good (best?) friend. He is very outgoing, extremely smart and does tend to pull quite a few women as he's one of those blokes who really just doesn't care what people think.

Me (24m): I'm going to be honest here. I'm average looking, shy and introverted. Less so since travelling, but I don't open up to people easy. I haven't had a lot of experience with girls (no where near as much as Tom). When people know me I am strange, weird and funny. Also very open. She gets it.


Background:

I met Tom (28m) while travelling through Vietnam. He and I are both originally from the UK but didn't know eachother from home. He was planning on moving to Australia, as was I. We became fast friends and a few months later when we were both living in Sydney, we moved in together and spent the majority of our year visa together. We were (are?) very close and spent almost every weekend hanging out. Most of my memories of the year I lived in Sydney involve him and I would imagine he feels the same way. 

In his last five months in Sydney, he met Lara (26f), a local girl from Sydney. They became romantically involved very fast, and spent the entire five months dating until he left the country. During this time, the three of us spent alot of time together and her and I got along extremely well. Their relationship was intense and serious, but she is extremely easy going and he is extremely full-on (in an in-your-face, strange kind of way), so I don't think they discussed their feelings very often. However, I've still never seen him like a girl that much since Lara. Their plan was for them to do long-distance for six months (so that Lara could save money) and then for her to move to the UK and be with him. He went straight back to the UK.

I suppose it all began my last three weeks in the country. Tom's visa expired before mine, and Lara's room mate had moved out of their apartment and the new person didn't move in for a month. As a result, she offered for me to stay with her. We'd all (Tom included) had previously had some rather large weekends so Lara and I were both keen to lay-low. We spent three weeks making dinner together, going to the movies, watching movies at home and going to the beach. We started getting much closer than we already were, and I suppose this is when my feelings for her surfaced.

On my last weekend (which I was planning on spending with Lara), he broke up with her completely out of the blue. She was on her way to come and meet me for drinks at the time, so I was the first person who she told. She seemed shocked, but to be honest she cheered up really fast. Lara doesn't often show her emotions, so she essentially told me that she never wanted to hear his name mentioned ever again and she'd be absolutely fine. We still spent the weekend together and had an amazing time. She even drove me to the airport and hugged me goodbye.

I spent the next six months living in New Zealand before heading home. I literally spoke to Lara every single day. If I didn't message her first, she would always message me. We didn't flirt or anything. Mostly just talked complete crap. She came to see me twice while I was there and we did a bit of travelling together around NZ. During this time, I did notice that there was a bit of flirting, but it may have been wishful thinking. 

Tom had mentioned to me a few times that he was really missing her. He also mentioned that he'd messaged her on facebook and she'd seen it and not replied. He asked me to talk to her when she came to see me but I didn't.

She decided to move ahead with her plans to move to London, but was planning on doing two months holiday beforehand. By the time she arrived in London I was already living there. 

Now: 

We are both living and working in London. She'd been here eight months and we've essentially become best friends. She's dated a few guys but never really seems all that bothered about anyone. She's casually seeing a two blokes at the moment, but probably spends more time with me. 

I know it's ridiculous for me to even think I have a chance, but after thinking about this way too much, here are the hints I'm getting:

- She spends more time with me than anyone. If she's meant to be meeting a guy she's dating and I text her to hang out, she will usually blow them off.

- We do flirt a little sometimes. Small things like if I'm walking down the street with her she will try and push me into a pole. Or if she's drunk at a party she will sit on my lap.

- She ALWAYS gets a little bit weird if I talk about girls, so I don't anymore. I've noticed it makes her really quiet. She won't tell me about anyone she's dating unless I specifically ask, and then she is really tight-lipped about it and makes a point of telling me she isn't bothered about the guy.

- We get along ridiculously well. I honestly don't think anyone will ever understand her like I do, and visa versa. 

- We speak all day. Just stupid stuff like sending eachother videos or funny pictures. Even if I am seeing her that night.

- A past fling of hers once asked her to stop hanging out with me so much because it made him uncomfortable. She refused and broke up with him.

My friendship with Tom isn't as strong as it was when we lived in Aus together, but we do still see eachother quite a bit (usually just nights out). I know he's tried to contact Lara once, but she didn't give him much of a response. Just said that she was living in London and hoped he as doing well. He knows we're still really close but I don't think he thinks that there would be anything going on. It sounds awful but I doubt he'd think I'd have a chance with her. 

My question is; Do I tell her how I feel? And how to I broach this with Tom? If I'm honest, I'd sacrifice the friendship for ANY kind of chance with her, as awful as that is? And how do I bring this up with her?

In all this time, he's dated people , I've dated people (at which point we stop sleeping together), and then just go back if we're both available.

He recently ended something with a girl he dated for a couple of weeks, so we got back to it. 
Saw him Friday night, then on Saturday he texts saying he's bored. I suggest we go out adn do something since i had no plans. We went out, I drank, he had a beer. 

During dinner, He asks me if it'd be weird if we went on a double date with his friend B and her boyfriend...That B had suggested it.

I've never met any of his friends. I was a bit tipsy at that point and taken aback and just brushed it off like yeah sure no prob!

Now that I'm sober, I don't think it's a good idea.

Another thing is, a few days ago, he had out of nowhere asked me for advise about how he should tell a girlfriend about B. That when he first met B he used to sleep with her, but B ended that arrangement and now they're good friends. They go to the same school so they study a lot together, most of the time just the two of them.
How he would understand if he had a girlfriend the girlfriend would just not be happy about it but he didnt want to lose the friendship with B.

I told him when that happened, that maybe he should just introduce his his girlfriend to B, so they'd get to know each other and she'd see there's nothing between the two of them anymore.

11976,Relationships,2uuabl,"Ok so...here goes. And please tell me if it's something I should be worried over. And let me just start off by saying that husband and I don't have a typical marriage. We've been married for 3 years, together for 5, we spend every free moment together and wouldn't have it any other way.

We tell each other everything...literally. But since our daughter [4months] has been born, our marriage has been through the wringer, and has endured quite a lot of stress.

Anyway. The other night I was grabbing a baby blanket off of the rocking chair where his phone was laying and I happened to see a Facebook PM from some random girl. I shrugged it off but it was still somewhat...flirty. Oh well. 

Later that night he kept laughing at something on his phone and totally just wasn't present in the living room when we were watching The Daily Show and other shit we usually do. Often I would catch him just not listening to me but I eventually asked what was so funny/what he was reading, assuming it was something on reddit, and all he said was, Oh, nothing, just talking to (we'll call him) Rich.

Fast forward to today when I was on the computer and got on Facebook. Him and I have many of the same friends so I scrolled down the feed as usual until a message from some random girl popped up that I didn't know. I soon realized whose profile I was actually logged into. Not the first time this has happened but I normally just log out and log into mine. Anyway...

First of all, I'm not proud of the fact that I read it but I have no regrets either. What followed (or, preceded, I should say) was the conversation they had the other night. It began as him asking her why she kept sending him candy crush invites. 

He gets 1000 of those a day, as do I, but there weren't any other messages to people asking them to stop sending invites. I mean, seriously? It was clearly a flirt tactic. Because they fucking flirted for the next few hours.

They talked about their relationships...of course, mainly about his complicated marriage and her being recently single, and him trying to get that story out of her. She wouldn't tell him at first which made him say shit like, Well now I *have* to know or I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. And amidst the sea of lol's and hahaha's were a ton of Facebook emojis that they discussed, (a few googly eyes from him and hugs from her).  

I mean, sure, we bicker sometimes but we always apologize and it never gets out of control, and it's sure as hell none of *her* business. Having a kid is stressful but not the end of our marriage...I thought. 

After teasing him some more, she finally went on to tell him about her recently failed relationship, and how it was a long story. He said something to the effect of, I'll be up for a few more hours so make it as long or short as you like. :) She also went through his profile pictures and left a bunch of vague comments on them. I know this because I'm tagged in a bunch of them so I saw the comments...

First of all, how does he have time for another girl's problems when he doesn't have time for mine? 

Whenever I try to vent to him about anything these days he just sort of tunes it out and doesn't listen. He wants to be able to solve all my problems and he doesn't like to hear them if they can't be fixed so he thinks I should just get over whatever it is. Sometimes I just need to vent and I thought that's what he was there for but apparently he only plays that role for strangers.

The point is, again, he doesn't have time to help me wash pump parts, and he's always too exhausted to let me nap, but he has time to listen to the musings of some random girl? (Whose last name just so happens to be my daughter's middle name). Should I be worried or am I being paranoid? I mean, I know he has girl friends that he talks to and I couldn't care less. I love them all and I have no problem with that--many of them have become my friends too. He's always been a girl's guy. But *this* girl, I don't know...and he doesn't talk about her. So...that's where I'm at.

This fucking sucks because he was my best friend. Now I don't know how to act around him and I sure as hell can't talk to him about anything I want. 


Should I tell him I read the messages or wait and see if they talk some more? I don't know that I'll even have access to the messages again because he changed his password, apparently. We've always known each others' passwords to everything but I guess that, too, has recently changed. 



---   
**tl;dr**: Husband has been chatting/flirting with a girl on Facebook that I don't know and I don't know how to handle this information. Do I tell him I read it? Or do I wait and see if it happens again? Also, her profile picture is basically boobs.


UPDATE: I took the most popular advice and, tail between my legs, confronted him. It was really hard considering we've always prided ourselves in not being snoopers. He admitted he shouldn't have done what he did when he could've been doing other things to help out with the baby, but ultimately assured me they were just old friends. I told him I realized that but they weren't good enough friends to keep in touch like his other girl friends I have no problems with him having. He then tried to say, What am I gonna do, drive across the country to cheat? I sort of called him out when I told him I saw the beginning of the conversation where he asked if she was still living in AZ (we live in CA). I said, Oh you mean, across the country as in, the next state over? (-_-) 

So at this point, I don't know what's happening. I agree with one of the comments in that I need to attempt to rebuild what we have, I owe him that. No, I don't believe he's cheated, mainly because it's not really his style. He would have to cheat emotionally before he would do anything physical. Mainly because he wasn't really that experienced in the physical dept. until we got together...

So hopefully I've stopped whatever was about to start but only time will tell as I'm sure at this point he'll delete all his conversations from now on. I told him I didn't want him to feel like he needed someone else to talk to even though he was really just lending an ear to an old friend. (I still think they barely knew each other). He also said he feels like I don't listen to him all the time but that he understands why, since I'm easily distracted by the baby. I told him I'm sorry and that is try to focus more of my attention in him. 

I didn't make a big fuss about the find but asked him if, in the same situation, he would do the same thing. Yes. The answer was yes, he would be curious about who I was talking to. But with me, he wouldn't have found a conversation. I ignore every advance I get on facebook (which I do still, for some reason, get, even though I'm married with a child). 

He's being really nice now which is kind of weird. I think he feels bad or something. Feel free to keep offering advice on how to handle the situation as it's far from over. I don't know how to/if I should trust him or if he trusts me. I feel like this has forever changed our entire dynamic as a couple.

She is super fun, laughs at just about everything, doesnt seem like the jelous type at all and is just a cool person to hang out with, we have interesting conversations and for the most part get along great. I'm also very attracted to her, she's not as fit as I am but I find her irresistable, her look, her smike, her personality, how she treats me and others, just everything about her. If it wasn't for our core beliefs she seems like the type of woman I would marrry.

So here's where we clashed, she's a devout chistian while I'm an agnostic. She belieaves in heaven and hell, she doesnt believe in evolution and she believes in no sex or any type of sexual act before marriage. I was open minded about everything she believed in until she mentioned the no sex part. I've had three sex partners before her, I told her I couldn't marry anyone before having sex first because you can't truly know someone unless you've been intimate with them, before that it's just dating and I'm sure as hell not going to marry someone without knowing we'll be compatible in bed. I don't see marriage as the end goal, I see it as the top layer of dulce de leche on a cake, it's great without it, but lets just add it to make it perfect, to me marriage means I know every quirk of yours, I know everything I like about you and everything I don't and I'm ready to give you my life and make you happy untill death do us appart. Also, I had to be honest with myself, I know months from now I'll crave to be intimate with her, if she doesn't fullfill my needs I will look for it somewhere else.

I still think she is an amazing woman and I want her in my life even if it can't be in the way I would like, I told her I wanted to continue our relationship strictly as friends, she agreed. I probably seem like an asshole who just wants sex, but I am really looking for the one, and I feel just as strongly to having sex before marriage in order to have a healthy relationship as she does to holding it off.

We were absolute best friends up until the beginning of 2014, then something went whack and we drifted away. We were both pretty torn up for a little bit but we both think the other is an awesome person. Since we are both college students at the same university, I see her often. We talk one-to-one, as friends, on a monthly basis essentially. Since all her friends were my friends first, after the break up, she was relatively friendless. She has two mutual friends that she hangs out with who certainly wanna get in her pants, but she'd never do anything with them (I know I can think that, but I'm serious, she's a 9 and they're awkward and 3s). I'm fairly certain she hasn't gotten anything being that she has a limited friend group and would just go to the bars with said two mutual friends.

11983,Relationships,2s1fa8,"Hi reddit, a bit( a lot a bit) of back story here; my SO and I started dating about 6 months ago, and it was an odd beginning; a week after we met I went on a week long trip with one of my guy friends from college, and a few weeks after I had a guy friend who I had some romantic history with in the past come to visit me. Nothing happened with either of those guys (the one who I had romantic history with kissed me upon seeing me, and I put a stop to it immediately and explained that I was sort of seeing someone who I liked and wanted to respect).  Most importantly, When I first met my SO and while all of this was happening, I was studying for an exam to get into grad school and didn't see the point in a long term relationship, and while I liked him a lot I wasn't going to cancel my trip a week after meeting someone or have my friend cancel his plane ticket just because i met someone (this guy and I had been friends for 3 years and while we would make out every once and a while it was far from serious; he lives literally on the other side of the world). I was entirely open with my now-SO the entire time, and while I can understand that all of that was upsetting for him, especially upon initially meeting me, 1) we weren't dating 2) if it bothered him so much he shouldn't have stuck with me.   I think what throws me for a loop the most was that while all of this was going on I kept complete open communication with him about all of it and he didn't seem to mind; he gave me the impression that he trusted me and my relationship with these guys, and that I wasn't going to cross the line (even though we weren't dating, I figured it would be grossly disrespectful to have a close friendship/friends with benefits with someone while banging someone else on the side if it wasn't explicitly okay from the get go).


Fast forward a few months, I have known my SO for about 3 months at this point; I bomb my grad school entrance exam because of some poorly managed and untreated anxiety, and don't do nearly well enough to get into any of my dream schools. I don't really have words to describe what that was like for me, but it was a lot of soul searching and reevaluating my life. I decide that I would rather push grad school off a year and spend time getting my anxiety under control and what not, so I decide to stay in the same area as my SO. Thus, I decided that I wanted to give dating my now-SO a shot.

Fast forward to now and things have been great, -insert tales of love here-,for the most part, except there was a period of time (about 2 months ago) when he would get upset and constantly being up the circumstances of how our relationship started off, how all of these guys were in my life and how horrible I was for doing all of that, etc. Cue the flood gates; what wasn't an issue then ( at least a verbalized one) became a huge issue when it's completely out of my power to do anything about it(can't change the past).The fights/conversations always ended this way; after bitching about it, he said how if he didn't want to deal with it he shouldn't have dated me and how yes I was going to grad school but my plans changed, etc. During this period he became extremely jealous and insecure, to the point where if I made eye contact with some guy on the street one day and my SO noticed, he would bring it up later that day and cue the same old fight. 

I quickly grew sick of that behavior that I told him that he had to work on it or I didn't want to do this any more. Since then, we've both made some compromises and everything has been good. I've made amazing strides with my anxiety and have finally felt like myself since god knows how long. I definitely attribute a lot of my anxiety gains to him being incredibly supportive and understanding. After that conversation, things seemed awesome with us, and since his lease is ending and my landlord is crazy we decided to move in together. In my eyes all is grand.

UNTIL, cue tonight. My boyfriend worked late the night before and he was asleep in bed. I lost my phone and decided to use his phone to call mine. I go to his favorites and a few names under mine and his best friend's I see the name of a girl I don't immediately recognize. I know the name of his close friends and family members so this is a huge red flag for me. Since my head is screaming,isn't this ironic, I decide to look at his text messages. I know this wasn't ethical behavior, but after his jealous rages the past few months I felt like I had to look. So, look I do, and this is what I see:


- A text message sent twoish months ago to her about how I am pitifully insecure, too wrapped up in my own head to notice what's going on around me(my then-crippling anxiety) and all of these other jabs at me

- some recent texts that he's initiated, asking for a picture of her face, randomly texting her asking how she is, saying they should hang out, etc.


I understand him needing to text someone and bitch about me, especially when I was an anxious mess after doing horribly on my exam, and bitching about me to his close friends is FINE, but some random girl? Not fine. Just the thought of this makes me nauseous.  And while we've certainly had some issues, I never bitched about him to anyone, not even when he was being super jealous. Also, why is he flirting with her NOW, when things are good? A part of me thinks it's just him trying to gain some sort of control after our history, and maybe him talking to and flirting with another girl gives him that, but still; I'm really upset by all of this and not sure the next move or how to go about it. I could try and forget about it but yeah right; the only thing my anxious mind does is assume the worst (i.e, cheating, saying he's at work when he's actually seeing her, whatever).  I could admit to snooping through his texts and bring it up which I'm not really proud of...wahhh I'm just not sure what to do here, especially because we're supposed to move in with each other in a few weeks. Was it doomed from the start? Help!!!

Our relationship has been a bit rocky in the past (I cheated on him), but we have been working through it. We are best friends and get along amazingly. The only issue we have had in our relationship is sex. I am a very sexual person and he isn't at all. I desire sex a lot more often than he does. He cannot get an erection about three quarters of the time we try to have sex. This has been going on our entire relationship. We have talked about it and he tells me that he is extremely turned on but his penis just won't get hard. This is frustrating for me because I don't initiate it as often as I like and when I do it usually ends in him not being able to get an erection. I've told him that I want him to see a doctor for it but he refuses. He doesn't think it is that big of a deal but it is leaving me so unsatisfied and it is lowering my self confidence. I don't know what to do anymore. I constantly feel tempted to cheat but I know I shouldn't. Has anyone been in a similar situation and have any advice?

11985,Breakups,27md32,"My ex bf and I have been friends for 3 years and dated on and off for almost 2. He's a really sweet guy and I was very happy in our relationship. Every time we're doing really great and he tells me he is happy, he all of the sudden just ends the relationship. He’s told me he has been depressed and that he is just always sad. 


His parents are divorced, his father has issues with addiction. His mother remarried (someone who was an alcoholic) when he was 8 and is now going through a divorce. He bottles his problems inside and I think he isn't aware of how healthy relationships should look.


When he goes through these periods of “breaks” we do not talk for usually a month and he seeks out someone else. It never works out for them and he always ends up breaking up with them then calling me and apologizing. He says he didn’t appreciate me or what we had and he thought I was the reason he was sad and angry. 


I understand how it feels to be depressed, having been depressed myself in high school and my first year of college, so I am empathetic towards him and also still deeply care for him. These breaks would happen when I was at college and he had just graduated, so I no longer saw him as often and it made it easier for me to get over the break up.

 
We eventually worked everything out, then once I graduated I moved to the same city as him, just down the road with some friends I had met through him. Things were rocky at first with me trying to find a good job, my own friends, and just my way around the city. We were fighting often, but there was never any breaking up talked about. 


Fast forward to 10 months later and we are very happy. We are finally in the groove of things and where we wanted to be. Then randomly he just tells me he isn’t happy in the relationship and we make each other angry all the time, which isn’t true from my end at all.


We stopped talking for a month, but we had previously planned this vacation together with his mother and brother. He said he still wanted me to come so I did. It was honestly the most fun I have had in a very long time. He told me he loved me and we discussed all of our problems then agreed we would try once we got back home. He agreed he would see a therapist and that his negative feelings towards me aren’t my entire fault. The next day after we got back he changed his mind about trying and working things out. 


I just wish we could figure out what it is that is making him so upset, but he now doesn’t seem to want to see a therapist. I’ve been reading books and articles about depression in men and he seems to fit the mold for what Dr. Terrence Real calls “covert depression.” He read some of the book and even says he can identify with a lot of it. Has anyone ever heard of this or dealt with something like this? Have you ever blamed your partner for your pain then realized it was not caused by them? Did seeking any form of treatment help you or relationship?

I really love him and would like to stick it out, but I’m so heartbroken right now. It’s especially difficult now that we live so close and have the same friends.

People when asked about each one of us seperately will say we look normal or cute. We are not appearing as aggresive or weird in any way (clothing, grooming etc) and are civilised.

However, people in random different areas will stare at us or go even further by touching their noses or scrubbing their eyes after a stare (edit: this may be irrelevant, just stating my observation). I stare back sometimes. Sometimes I try to look indifferent but I understand it negatively affects our mood. Is this kind of relationship considered some kind of taboo? I certainly do not think so since I see many couples like us on street. I am afraid it might be some racism involved. 

To be honest, I cannot tell why it affects me, I try to ask why does it bother you how a random person feels about your situation? but nothing comes up in my head. 

I would greatly appreaciate some advice from other couples like us or open-minded individuals who know more about the culture.

So, back story: I have not been in a relationship or even dated anyone I felt interested in, in about 3 years. 3 years ago I was in a very emotionally abusive relationship. I was often called needy and clingy. I began to believe those things..until I learned that my ex was only using my in between trying to get back together with his ex. Yeah, I know, jerk city! But, also a lot of people have been through the same thing. So, I put on my big girl shoes and decided to take my time taking care of me and learning what I want before diving into anything else. 3 years later and a few possibles we are to the now...

About two weeks ago I decided to try one of the popular dating sites at work out of bordem with my co workers. I was matched with quiet a few people but none I was even remotely interested in. Until, I was matched with Chad. He was insanely handsome and very articulate in his bio, which included a bit about not wanting hookups or one night stands. (Relevant to me because hook ups don't do much for my newly rebuilt confidence and because it seems to me that means you are looking for something a little more serious.)

I start talking to Chad, and actually agree to meet for coffee. Days later coffee goes great! We ended up staying for hours and just talking about real life stuff. It was so refreshing. I almost immediately got a text saying how much fun he had and asking if I would like to meet up again soon. We planned our second date. I went to show my friends his photo and he had deleted his dating account, not sure if that is relevant. 

Second date again goes great! Hours later and more great conversation (including terms like: Are you even real? You just keep getting better and better, ect.) we left and I got an awkward side hug. Ok, fine..I am happy with taking things slowly. I decide not to invest much into this, because I do get attached quickly. Again, I get a text about how much fun he had. 

I didn't hear much from him, so I asked about an event he was involved in that he invited me to. He responded immediately that I should come. So, I showed up with my friend. He seemed extremely happy that I showed up and continued the night hanging around me. He then invited me to go to dinner with his friends after the event. I asked again to make sure he didn't feel obligated to invite me. (cue the residual don't be clingy's in the back of my head.) He promised I wasn't inturepting anything and told me he would be mad if I didn't come. Great night with his friends in which he was the same person and equally as flirty..my friend commented multiple times on the way home how he couldn't keep his eyes off of me, ect. I received the thanks for coming, you made it better text shortly after arriving home. 

We had made plans to possibly hang out the next day. He told me to call and wake him up and we would do something fun. I didn't actually want to wake him up, so I text him when I was up. I heard from him later in the afternoon and he apologized for not doing anything but asked how my day was going and what I was doing with my night even though he had to work...

Then that was sort of it. I sent him a funny relevant photo yesterday and got a half ass response. Nothing since then.

Now, here are some other details. I saw him 5 days ago. Talked to him 4 days ago. In my girl brain that is a long time if you're trying to possibly start something with someone. Also, in my girl brain I am trying to figure out what the heck I did wrong.

I do know he was in a serious relationship about 9 months ago. We didn't talk in depth about that yet, because well we only truly went on 2 dates.

So, my question to you dear souls who have read all of this: Did I do something wrong or should I just let it go? I don't let many people close, haven't in the past 3 years so I am taking this blow a lot harder than I should. Because, I actually let him have a shot. Has it been too long for me to expect anything out of it? Are their signs I am not seeing? And unrelated to this specific situation, How have you got back into dating after getting over a hard relationship without getting hurt?

Again, thank you precious person for reading all of this.

Historically I've dated men who, for the most part, have been on the emotional and communicative side, which has relieved a lot of the typical anxiety around the questions of where do I stand?, how does he feel about me?, etc. 

I recently started dating a man who, for lack of a better term, checks a lot of my boxes, but who has yet to clue me in on even a sliver of what's going on inside his head. This is a challenge for me because I hate to make assumptions or read between the lines, which are skills that I don't think I've ever developed a proficiency for given my dating history. However, he has initiated spending time together, physical contact, and checks in with texts regularly, so I do my best to balance his actions with his (lack of) words.

As a rule, I try to avoid hurting feelings, but I'm afraid I will given how hard this man is to read. For example, I left late instead of staying the night because he never made it clear that's what he wanted. Once it was clear I was leaving, I sensed that he thought I was staying and saw on his face that he was disappointed. While I know some of these awkward miscommunications are unavoidable, I'd like to prevent them as much as possible.

So, given my personality, would it be best to take this as a lesson learned and stick to dating more emotionally expressive and open guys, or is there a good strategy to understanding actions instead of relying on words? I'm guessing there's a decent chance that he may open up in the future once he trusts me enough to be vulnerable, but I'm more concerned with the getting-to-that-point.

Just a little background information: 
We dated for almost a year. Let's call her S. There were some trust issues, we broke up, and we didn't talk for a good two months. We started reconnecting and it was like...nothing happened. We hung out, talked, laughed, everything that friends do. Then one day after school I was backstage for drama club, and she came in. We were alone. Long story short, we kissed. Over the next few weeks, we talked things out, struggled with a lot of confusion, and eventually came to the conclusion that we still like or maybe even love each other.


We decided that we weren't ready to just jump back into a relationship. We were hurt over the previous breakup, and frankly our peers wouldn't take it too well. So we decided that we could continue to have this half relationship sort thing, but we wouldn't let anyone know about it. We're pretty much in a relationship without the official title of a relationship.


Here's where things start sucking. While we weren't talking, another guy (let's call him M) asks S to Homecoming. She says yes, because why not? She liked him for a little bit, but after I came back in she stopped liking him. However, all of our peers think they'd be the cutest couple ever.


Since we're both *technically* single, I'm okay with her flirting with him every now and then. I know he likes her, but she's voiced numerous times that she doesn't like him. It seems to be mostly out of pity.


However, today while waiting at the side of the stage for drama, I realized that both S and M were missing. I look backstage a bit and see them embracing - not just a normal friend hug, but something more. I don't know if they were kissing or not...but it really looked like it. I walked out of the room through a door backstage and saw them just hugging. I don't know if they were only hugging earlier or not. Thing that especially peeves me is that she told me that she loved me less than 20 minutes prior.



I think she noticed that I saw them, because when i was back she was sitting on some risers alone, looking kinda down. I sat down next to her, but I didn't talk to her.


I know this is something I need to bring up with her. This isn't the first time something like this has happened with M. And when I asked about it prior, she told me that I didn't need to worry. We broke up the first time because of my jealousy, and I don't want her to think I'm unchanged, immature, and jealous. 


Thing is, I don't know how. Her mom is constantly fighting with her and some of her friends are complete assholes. Because of this, she's upset a lot. I don't want to add to that list, especially if nothing's going on. I was planning on Skyping her today, but she just messaged me saying that her mom's making her drop drama because of her grades. She doesn't need this on her back, but I don't know how much longer I can deal with it.


How can I approach her with this? I'm hurt and confused about what I saw today, but I don't want her to feel even worse than she already does.

I’d spend most free nights alone watching tv, which I thought I was okay with, but I have come to realize that I’m the sort of person that likes to socialize/be around people more often than not. Another consequence of being a loner for a long time is that while I have a facebook, there are pretty much no pictures or posts on it (this is important later). 
So I made the effort over the past few months to talk to people more and make plans, and as a result I met a cute guy. He seemed really into me. We spent two days in a row together, went out for lunch, talked about our lives, etc. Then he started flirting more openly with me and suggesting that we go on more dates and spend more time together. It was sometime right after this that he sent me a friend request on facebook which I accepted, and then right after that, all talking between us pretty much stopped. When I texted him a couple days later he responded with short texts, and we haven’t talked for a while. So I know this could be for a lot of reasons, but I have a feeling that he lost interest because of my lack of presence on social media. I’m 19, so everyone my age has hundreds of pictures on facebook with many friends. Someone having barely any pictures I guess seems off.

I really liked this guy and I’d be pretty annoyed if this was something about me that made me seem strange or unlikeable to other people. At least then I could proactively fix it, either by trying to have more of a presence on social media or deleting it altogether.

**TL;DR: 14-year dead-ish bedroom finally culminates on emotional and physical cheating. Other woman breaks things off abruptly. The only thing worse than the feeling of guilt over the cheating is the heartbreak from the affair breakup, which only makes the guilt worse. Halp.**

So, to state the obvious first, I'm a cheating piece of shit. I need to tell my wife about the affair and let her decide what she wants to do...

**BACKSTORY:** Met Wife 14 years ago, dated, fell in love, got married. From the very beginning we had problems with intimacy and sex, me needing a lot more from her than she was comfortable giving. We still had regular sex, but it always was initiated by me - and I'd still get rejected 9 out of 10 times. General intimacy, touching, kissing, hand-holding, romantic gestures, etc. were always an issue. But we loved each other and were such a perfect match in every other aspect of our relationship that we figured we could make it work. Well, as it turns out, after 12 or 13 years of rejection, I finally broke: about 8 or 9 months ago, after a week-long affection drought, I had The Talk™ with her (people familiar with dead bedrooms will know which talk I'm talking about) but this time I brought up the possibility of divorce and laid out specific steps she would need to take in order to salvage things. It finally clicked with her. [Here's a post I made about the day it all went down.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/2a6jv0/i_hlm_had_the_most_amazing_sex_with_my_ll_wife/cisj2vm) It hasn't been perfect, but she's done a lot to improve the situation - individual therapy, couples counseling, hormone testing to see if anything was off, got a prescription for her anxiety which has really helped... She's also a lot more genuinely affectionate now, kisses and hugs and holds my hand more, initiates sex more often (not nearly as much or as enthusiastically as I'd like, but still amazing progress) and is more open to my advances so I'm not getting rejected quite as much (maybe only half the time now.) But... there's always a but in these things, isn't there?

After over a decade of getting rejected, I can't see my wife in the same way as a sexual and romantic partner. I still love her and I know she loves me. We're best friends, we're family, we're everything to each other - but I just lost the passion, I guess. For all the effort she's finally putting into the relationship, I find myself not really feeling it, if that makes sense... Which brings me to...

**THE OTHER WOMAN:** So a few months ago, I met a woman in a random online forum for people who are into a very specific sport. We started talking and it turned out that we live about a 2-hour drive from each other. It also turns out that she's in a dead bedroom marriage, too and is in the process of getting a divorce. We moved from messages on the forum to texting, to talking on the phone. The sexual tension was palpable. And so, after thinking about it for a while and coming to terms with the horrible shit I was about to do, we set up a date and I made the 2-hour drive to see her for lunch. We ate, then made out in her car. And it was incredible.

We continued to text and talk and decided to take things to the next level (sex.) We set up a date to take a day off and meet in a hotel halfway between both our hometowns. Now, the whole time I'm thinking and telling her I love my wife, I'm not leaving her, this is just about sex, blahblahblah... What a naïve moron...

As this is all developing, she's clearly hinting at the fact that she's falling for me. I make a point of shutting down any talk about emotional involvement, but if I'm honest, I was loving the feeling of being wanted and loved in a way that I never felt from Wife.

Our fuck date comes and it was... the best day of my life. Just incredible, passionate, romantic, engaged, enthusiastic sex. And after it was all over and I was back home, I realized I'd fallen madly, deeply, teenagerly in love with Other Woman. She gave me exactly what I'd been missing in my marriage and it was intoxicating. I fell hard - and she reciprocated. But then...

**TROUBLE:** As I let my feelings get away from me, I start pressuring her for more. She pulls away and tells me she needs space, so I give her some space, but then she calls me crying asking for less space, I guess... We made it work for a little bit, but the distance, the secrecy and just the general fucked-up-ness of the whole thing made everything tough. To make matters worse, she has a very demanding job and is going to grad school, so me adding to her already super-high stress led to...

**THE BREAKUP:** After Other Woman was acting extremely distant for about a week, I asked her to tell me what was happening. She finally called me last night and broke things off. Gave me some I'm a shell of a person/my life is too complicated/it's not you, it's me bullshit and, I'm not proud of it, I begged her to stay. Didn't work. After a really tense couple of texts this morning, I've come to terms with the fact that it's over and it's probably for the best. And that has me feeling like dying. She revived something in me that I thought was dead, gave me a little glimpse of what could be... and then yanked it away from me. I'm absolutely devastated, I'm sobbing randomly at work and I'm about as close to considering suicide as one can get without actually being serious about it. And the fact that I'm so torn up about something that shouldn't have even happened and was supposed to just be about sex when it started makes me feel incredibly guilty about what I've done to...

**MY MARRIAGE:** My wife loves me and I love her back. But I don't know if I'm *in love* with her anymore. Actually, after finally feeling so head-over-heels crazy about someone and having them actually reciprocate the feeling, I don't know if she's ever been in love with me, to be honest. Part of me thinks we should just go our separate ways, but the thought of losing her just... it destroys me... I don't know what the fuck to think or do here, but I've made my bed and now I have to lay on it. Every option is shitty, and that shittiness is 100% the result of my own choices and actions.

**SO... HELP?:** R/relationships, I know I'm a piece of shit. I'm ready for all the hate that's rightfully coming my way. But please, I need advice on (a) how to deal with this overwhelming sense of guilt and loss and more guilt; and (b) what to do next and how to go about it.

12004,Breakups,3dxd23," We moved in together about 1 year ago. Our lease is up in 1 month and I can't decide if/how I should end it. She is really great. I mean like really great to me. She does everything she possibly can to make me happy (almost to a fault). Great cook, super clean. She is out of my league looks wise. She is well on her way to an incredibly successful career and would never do anything to hurt me, ever. I've never met anyone who loves me like she does. Her family loves me and does a ton for me. My family loves her to death. And everyone assumes that we are going to be getting engaged very soon. The only thing is I don't think I feel the same way. 

I care for her more than i ever have anyone else. But she is constantly doing things that annoy the living hell out of me. But they are always out of sincerity. Like if i am having a bad day, she will ask me 500 times what's wrong so she can try and help. I keep saying nothing and she just keeps asking. I will snap on her, she will apologize, and then do the exact same thing 3 hours later. THings like this happen every single day.. She does not pick up on social cues very well and I am very introverted where she is very extroverted so this never changes. 

She owns most of the things in our home since I was finishing up school and she had already been working at a good job for a year. Another issue is that I graduate in 20 days and her and her family have sunk a ton of money and time into helping with my graduation party. She has also waited to start more schooling until I graduated to make sure I was not to stressed out.

I have never cheated on her before but I am constantly meeting new girls because of my job that are interested in me, and I am having a harder and harder time telling them I'm in a relationship. And if I am completely honest with myself it is probably a matter of time before I give in. 

Another thing that should be noted is that I am a competitive bodybuilder, and with bodybuilding comes a fair amount of Hormone use. One of these hormones tends to make people slightly more aggressive and aggetated easilier. I have taken this hormone a few times before and have never felt this way, but it is possible I suppose that it is now affecting me this way. Also, she does not know about this drug use and I never plan on telling her as I monitor my health and safety fairly closely and it would devastate her that i had lied about it.  

All of this seems like it points to end the relationship to me, but my biggest problem is that I don't think I can.. She will be utterly devastated. She has planned her whole life around me and would pack up in a heart beat to go wherever I want to. I have horrible anxiety issues, even more so about this and I do not think I will be able to do it. If I can just get the words out, i will quickly give in as soon as she starts crying to me. I know I shouldn't but that is honestly what will happen. 

I feel like most of you will say I've got to just balls up and end it, considering the lies and desire to date other women, and you're right. I just simply can't. If you managed to read all this and can help thank you so much!

12010,Breakups,2yt3vg,"So here it goes. 

I was with my ex for about 2 1/2 years with the last 9 months being full of fights and resentment. He graduated college and decided to not work for almost a year, during which he was battling depression and what his mother believes to be developing bipolar disorder. During this year, I was mostly living with him while finishing my last year of my degree and being hopelessly poor while completing an internship. The problems arose mostly from me being unhappy with how he talked to me and him snapping in moods during which he was uncontrollably angry and nasty. I was at a loss because I didn't want to lose him and would be very emotional, and he hated the attachment that came from my fear of breaking up.

During the last few months together we broke up and made up probably 5 or 6 times. It ended with him accusing me of cheating with a friend that I buy weed from, which I never did and would never even consider it, but no matter what I said he refused to believe me. He called me a cheating cunt and lots of other inappropriate things. So we didn't see each other for about two months after that.

Fast forward two month, I'm going through the worst semester of my life and starting antidepressants and therapy so that maybe I don't fail every class I'm taking. He and I never stopped texting, and eventually he starts asking me to meet up for coffee. I tell him no probably 3 times and then say yes. We meet up and talk and then go home and hang out. We end up kissing and I ask him to get back together and he says no, but we decide to keep hooking up.

We have a sort of friends with benefits situation for about 2 more months and I feel okay with it. I feel like some day I will be loved by someone I deserve but I decide to settle with the one I am comfortable with. I am still incredibly poor and he had since got a new job and was making tons of money, and I had not been buying birth control and he never offered to pay for it, so stupid decisions insue.

So valentines day, I pick him up from a work trip planning on telling him that I may be pregnant ( thank god I ended up not being) but I was scared. He is laying on his bed and I massage his neck telling him I had gotten sick this weekend and he tells me I should go home.  I asked him if he wanted me to home home if I don't feel like having sex. That is when he freaks the fuck out.

He says he can't believe I would say that, that I need to get out of his house before he calls the cops. I apologize and try to explain why I would ask that and he just continues to tell me that I'm a dumb bitch and I need to leave. That is when I start to cry and tell him I'm scared I'm pregnant and that I just want don't want to be alone tonight. He stops and says I'm a lying cunt and that he doesn't believe me. 

I couldn't help it, I just slapped him. Everything just hurt so bad. I slapped him twice. I don't believe in hurting anyone but I couldn't stop myself. I texted him later and apologize for it, but also said that the way he has treated me was unacceptable. That was a month ago, no response.

As far as my relationship, I'm struggling to move on from someone I loved but am doing better. I still feel horrible about the physical violence, and just wanted it off my chest. Any kind words of advice would be great.

12012,Infidelity,3gfvbx,"Back Story 

My partner and I have been together for almost 6 years and we have two young children together (18 months and 3 ½).  He has a job that frequently takes him away from home.  We have been dealing with distance for almost our entire relationship and have always had great communication.  However, this latest trip took him a 6 hour plane ride away for the past year.  We knew going into this that it would be extremely difficult – so like we had always done in the past we set up ground rules.  

1.	We were to communicate everyday unless otherwise specified.  
2.	We were both to send lots of pictures (me more than him)
3.	I was able to be with other women – but was to communicate exactly who/what/where etc. and this could only be done if both me and my partner felt our relationship was happy and healthy.  I should add that this was not common I had only been with one woman 3 times over the course of the entire year.  
4.	My partner was not free to see other women; however, I had told him on several occasions that if his sexual needs were ever getting so intense we should talk about it and agree upon something like BJ pass.  
5.	We had also planned visits every 3ish months – he left last August and we saw each other in October, December, May, and July.  We also had another trip planned for Feb/Mar but he was not able to get the time off of work.  

I have to say that I am completely blindsided by what has happened.  I really thought that our relationship was perfect.  Yes we fought occasionally, but there were no major problems apart from the distance.  Obviously, we were both craving sexual attention – but we compensated with long discussions, sexting, and Skype.  We also sent very thoughtful gifts and packages to each other.  

Key Events 

After our Christmas visit, I noticed that he was drinking more than usual.  I assumed that he was bored as his job did not allow him much freedom of movement.  We discussed it and he confirmed my theory.  So I did not worry.  

Fast forward to his May visit.  We were extremely happy to be back together and did so many great things both as a family and as a couple.  He even hid a bunch of candy packages around the house for me to slowly find after he left.  

Approximately two weeks after he returned to work it was a female co-worker’s birthday and a group of them went out to celebrate.  My partner and I chatted for approximately half hour before him and his friends left to celebrate.  This was normal for us and I didn’t expect to hear from him until the following day.  The next day he told me about the part – it seemed mostly normal things.  Pre-drank, went to a country bar, danced and went to bed.  However, he also said that there was a sketchy guy there that was buying shots for everyone.  My partner and another girl in his immediate group had one.  Apparently, the girl got very sick and a few of the other friends went to take care of her.  My partner said that they all left shortly after and went home.  He said that he thought he was drugged and the night felt blurry.  I asked him if there was anything that happened that could threaten our relationship.  He told me nope there was nothing to worry about.  
Things went on as normal and I did not give that night another thought.  Then about 3 weeks later I flew out to see him with our two boys.  We had a busy 3 weeks (wedding for a friend and retirement party for my dad) but still managed lots of alone time.  I had a great time on the trip and was excited that the distance would be over soon.  

Fast forward to this past Friday – we sent lots of flirty texts during the day including one where I called him ‘my hero.’  Then he was oddly quiet.  But I thought nothing of it as I knew he was probably busy with work or hanging out with the guys.  He made sure that he called me when he knew our children were in bed.  Then he dropped the biggest bomb on me (I will try to quote the story as best as possible): 

Me:  How was your day?  Did anything interesting happen?
Him:  Yes I really need to talk to you.  Birthday Girl told me something awful.  
Me:  Oh no did something happen with her pregnancy? (He told me a week or so before that she was now expecting her second baby – she is married.)
Him:  No when she was saying goodbye (her work was done and she would be moving back home) – she thanked me for the night of the party?  (Keep in mind the party was BEFORE I came to visit him)
Me:  Oh what for? (I am still pathetically unaware)
Him:  She said she was happy that she got to have me before we both had to leave.  
Me:  What do you mean? (My anxiety is rising – but I still have no doubts about his fidelity).
Him:  We apparently had sex – I don’t remember anything.  I think she raped me.  

At first I thought he was joking.  But then the tone of his voice told me that he wasn’t.  Cue a bunch of questions from me.  Sorry I am a little fuzzy on the exact flow of the conversation after this point.  But it eventually led to me asking things like why don’t you go to the police?  Report it!?  He was very against this idea – then I started asking more questions like:  Well what do you remember?  Did she dress you afterwards?  How did you not have any memory or hunches that something happened?  He answered I don’t know to almost every question.  Then I realized that she was pregnant – is it your baby?  He said he didn’t know and that he would most likely give up parental rights.  He also said that he was feeling sick all day and was very ashamed.  We were talking a lot and I said that I wanted to talk to Birthday Girl.  I wanted to know exactly what happened (because his answer was I know we had sex – but I do not remember the details).  I also wanted my partner to talk to her and her husband and get the whole story.  
The next morning I ask if he has talked to her; he has and sends me a screen shot of their texts. 

Birthday Girl:  (name of her older son) is excited to be a brother.  He is hoping for a sister. 
Him:  How has taken the news does he still want to be the father? 
 
There were a few more but they were not relevant.  As soon as I saw that text I knew that my partner was lying about the entire story.  I tried to confront him but then he said that he didn’t deserve me, called the suicide hotline and checked himself into the hospital.  We were texting quite a bit during this time, but I was more worried that he was going to hurt himself to worry about my feelings.  I also called his parents (they are only a few hour’s drive from his work) and told them that he was in the hospital.         
Then because he could not really communicate with me I decided to text Birthday Girl (her number was conveniently in the screen shot of the texts he sent me).  I should point out that I had met her in October and again in July when I came to visit.  

I texted her saying that I was not mad at her but that I knew something had happened between her and my partner, and that I would like to hear her side of the story.  She said that the night started innocently, there was lots of alcohol involved, they kissed at the bar, then kissed at the building they live in, then went to the basement to have sex (it is an apartment like building and they both have roommates).  I ask if the baby is her husband’s.  She says she is not sure, but she thinks that it is most likely my partner’s baby.  She will know more next week when she goes in for another U/S.  She also says that her husband does not want a paternity test and apparently my partner does not want parental rights – so she and her husband will raise the child.  

After this conversation I talked with my partner again – I am not sure on the sequence of events I am extremely emotional and not thinking straight.  But basically he wants to kill himself because he feels so terrible for what he has done.  He admitted to everything – it was not rape.  

We have had sporadic conversations yesterday and today.  But the truth is – I will never be able to accept a child from this type of betrayal.  I feel like a monster for hoping that she miscarries.  Or best case scenario that it is not my partner’s child. 
 
My partner and I both talked to his parents and they now know the entire story.  I have been too ashamed to tell anyone else.  I just don’t know what to do.  I cannot believe that this is my life.  I feel like I am in a cheesy soap opera.  

Relationships I need advice.  I have no idea what to do and I am dreading making a decision that will affect so many lives.  What do I tell my boys?  Should I get a lawyer?  Obviously I am going to get STI tested.  I am such a mess right now and would have never thought this possible.  I am not equipped to deal with this situation.  I thought I was going to be with this man forever.  All of my life’s plans included him.  I do not want to be a single mom/ part time parent.  My boys are most important in my life – so please help me to make the decision that is best for them.  They are so bright, beautiful, and innocent and I do not want them hurt by this mess.  Please help me.

Almost a year ago I moved across the country to be with a girl I thought I loved. Recently, it ended badly. A few close friends that I made after moving out here helped me get out of the situation. One of them is the 20f in the title. She is fucking great. Towards the end of my last relationship, I heard people talking about how she liked me, and wanted to date me. Well, after my relationship was officially over I asked her if she'd ever be interested in a relationship with me. She said no. I was fine with that. The problem is, we've recently moved in together as friends and I'm having trouble shaking the feelings I have and moving on. It makes me feel like such a beta idiot to get hung up on a girl like this. She's just so likeminded, and caring, and most importantly... funny. I really like her. Anyways, a few days ago we ended up drinking and had some physical stuff happen. No sex, just touching and stuff like that. Kept it to second base. She told me that if I was a few years older she would date me and stuff like that. It confused me just because I was finally starting to accept that I would NOT be able to date this girl that I do like so much. So r/relationships, should I get my shit together and hope there's a chance between us or accept the fate of the friendzone and move on? Questions are welcomed, I wasn't very detailed.

Then she saw me on tinder and went ballistic that i could do that and its disgusting and im some sort of perverted creep. is this her way of forcing herself to hate me in order for her to move on? or were we/are we able to still work on things? at this point things have become almost toxic and it was never like this while we were together.

i just dont understand how she can go nuts on me for that but not stop n think well what i did was pretty shitty so we can keep trying at this, instead she finally just ended it once and for all, and i knew this was going to happen. if she couldnt just be with me right away why are we trying to work on things? we were still acting like we were 2 weeks ago when we were together. 

just very confused right now but i know that its basically done. she got her reason to despise me and never look at me the same so she can move on. why didnt i just do that when i found out what she was doing? my own personality flaws? obviously im a nice guy. just sucks losing someone like this and never thinking this was going to happen to you.

12019,Breakups,1gui2s,"I [22F] have been in an on and off again relationship with my ex-boyfriend (Richard aka Dick) [23M] for the past 3 years while I was at college, it was long distance relationship as I was living down south and he was living significantly up north. In my final year of college, he called things off because things were too hard.

I recently moved back and after Dick failed at joining the army, we started things up again, but only as friends with benefits. This lasted two months before the situation got hairy. I wanted more, but knew that he wasn't ready for a relationship (he had made this very clear at the start).

During this two months I introduced him to my new friend circle I had made through my housemate, this included my friend Tina. At the start of the two months I noticed that Dick was behaving like he was interested in Tina [25F] and I told her/asked her not to do anything as I didn't think I could handle being friends with her and him if they were both in a relationship, I still had feelings for Dick.

After the two months with friends with benefits, I got drunk and told Dick how I truly felt and that I couldn't continue as we were without more, he didn't want a relationship so we decided that being friends was more important and the sex had to stop.

That was fine, Dick, Tina and I continued to go out and have fun with all of our now joint friend group. However, I just found out through my housemate (friend I met Tina etc through) that they are now dating and that he was asked to tell me, because they are apparently too cowardly to do it themselves?

Also he gave me herpes (HSV-2) a few months ago and she is allergic to latex so you can imagine how that is going to end out. He seems to be in denial about it and claims he had a negative test but is the only possible one who could have given it to me and I have my doubts he even got tested.

I am not sure how to react to this. I want to cut them out of my life altogether as seeing Dick with Tina will hurt so much, as Dick didn't want me but he is fine having a relationship with my friend (Tina). But I also feel like being the bigger person and accepting the relationship even though it will hurt a lot to see them together. I don't want to lose either of them, but I don't want to be hurt again in the process. Reddit what do I do?

I don't have an account but he does, and I know his usual username - which I don't check up on, he tends to just read and post on science related subreddits, since he works in that general area. This time however, I noticed he's logged in as a different username. Not unusual to have multiple accounts, I know... I wanted to troll him by posting a meme on AdviceAnimals or something (he likes to visit that sub quite often) and just have him be surprised by the replies. That's when I saw some of his posts under this other username...


Most of the posts are replies to threads about relationships, and they are fairly neutral. But there was one post in which he mentions his ex and a short description of their troubles, ending it with Obviously, we are no longer together. The description in the post fits us, or me, exactly (it was quite specific). Clearly he forgot to log out of his other account.


The post in question was posted 4 days ago. Last time we had a talk about our relationship (we had an argument the week before), and assured each other that we still love one another was 3 days ago.


I don't know what to think. Did he, in his head, break up with me? And talk online about how we didn't work out? Should I bring it up? I don't want him to think I was snooping, but this is really bothering me, as when we talk on the phone or Skype, it's just normal.

We had a generally healthy relationship but mutually decided before I moved that we'd break up once I moved due to the long distance and the fact she didn't want to live where I was moving to.  We ended the relationship under good terms and even talked about the possibility of maybe getting back together someday if we ever ended up living nearby each other again (which is very unlikely).

I've been having a really rough time dealing with the breakup and think I'm probably going to have trouble moving on.  The problem is, due to my school and internship schedule I'm likely going to be moving to different places 4 times over the next year and a half or so.  I feel like don't really want to try to start another relationship now, knowing any relationship would probably end pretty quickly when I start moving all over the place.  I think talking to other girls and going on dates would help me move on, but I don't want a relationship that will almost certainly end like my last one, and I'm not really interested in super casual dating or hook ups or anything like that.

I'm worried I'm going to hung up for a long time on her and the possibility of somehow getting back together even though I know it's extremely unlikely/next to impossible (there's virtually no jobs in my field where she lives).

12027,Dating,1pvmtx,"Some background, to start off with. In high school, I met my ex, and we dated for two years. The last year of that was long distance because of college, and we became very emotionally distant for months. I knew I needed to break up with him, and when I finally did a month ago, it was a huge relief. 

Now, the other guy. We met in college last year, and became good friends. I assumed it was a purely platonic relationship because he never gave any indication that he liked me, and because obviously I was dating someone. After I broke up with my ex, my friend told me that he's liked me for a long time, but he respected me too much to say anything before. I've always liked him as a person and I think he's attractive, so although I was surprised, I decided to give it a go. 

In the past month, we've been making the transition from friends to dating. We already spent a lot of time together because we were friends, except now we also go on dates and I sleep over (although nothing sexual has happened, I didn't want to rush). We're both very happy and like each other a lot, but he has expressed concern that I'm unintentionally rebounding with him. Personally, I feel like I'm not, but I don't want to hurt him if that's actually what I am doing. I emotionally checked out of my last relationship so long ago that it feels like we've been broken up for ages. I'm not sad or angry over the break up, and I harbor no jealousy or ill will for my ex.

For example, he just did this again tonight, after we spent about 8 hours together at my apartment. He was really tired, so he took a nap while I did some housework, and then played some video games for a while. We ate supper, watched some TV, and had some sexy time. About an hour after that, he decides that he's going to leave. All throughout today though, he had been talking as though he was going to stay the night. He asked when I have to work tomorrow, brought his overnight bag, and I asked him what he'd want for breakfast tomorrow morning. Without warning though, he decided to leave.

Admittedly, I am a kind of boring person, and we were planning on going to the movies tonight and didn't go.

Been together over a year.

He is living 90mins away from me in a house in his dads name, he pays the mortgage.

Lives with his dog, next door to an interfering mother. 

His work is around 25 mins from where he lives, though this is just a pick up place as he actually travels round the country and can work away for upto 5days at a time.

This work is extremely well paid.

If he doesn't get much of this work however he either loans off his dad (rarely pays it back) or works for dad to pay for the house, bills etc.


When we met he told me he hated the area where he lived, wouldn't be there more than a year.

Now me. I live in a nicer area 90mins away.

I live with my mum though it's my place, she moved in after loosing her job and couldn't afford to live alone, I offered her my spare room.

I pay majority though she now works part time and helps out which means I have bit more spare cash.

I have two dogs. (Very small)

I am self employed and earn enough to support my place (though it's very very cheap) I earn a lot less than him.

Now the issue, he picks me up on a Friday night, I pack my stuff and my dogs and go stay at his every weekend.

I hate this as I hate his area, messes up my dogs training and routine big time, his mum always comes round and acts like I dont exist.

This has been happening for a year and I don't want it to continue this way forever.

I'm not saying we move in together now but I wanna know its on offer at some point.

Issue is he can't afford to buy his own place (he probably could if he saved but he blows his cash left, right and centre)
And it's unlikely I will ever be able to (my field doesn't pay much though I love it and I don't have the family wealth and support he does)

He's refusing to rent. Ever. Which is pretty much my only option in life.

He's been saying for a year that anytime now his dad will give him money for a house. This hasn't happened and I don't see it happening anytime soon.

I don't want to wait around for his dad to give us money for a house, what if it never happens? Or it takes 10 years.

His reasoning is I don't wanna be renting when I'm 50

Fair enough, but if your so sure your getting this money soon why would you be renting at 50? (This is without the fact he has lots of elderly relatives who are pretty well off so he will never be broke) 

I've made it clear as soon as his dad gives him the money we can leave the rented place and go in this house.

Next issue is I want to be near enough that I can keep my work and he has to be near enough to his pick up point so that he doesn't have a stupid commute. (Even though he only does this drive twice a week).

He doesn't seem to want to be within an hour of my town (my clients won't travel that far) which means I will have to start all over again and my pay wil be less as I try to build up again.

Now I know I don't earn much, I will be able to pay half to rent, or pay for food and one utility bill, so maybe I don't have a right to say anything until things are equal?


But the places I've looked at would mean he either pays the same or even less (because I would be chipping in) than where he's living at the moment so he won't be out of pocket. 

Plus he has to get his mum to watch his dog while he's away which she always throws in his face, I would watch the dog.

He wouldn't have the petrol he uses to come and get me every week.

And we would be living together which to me, I'd the main driving force.

I've tried talking about it but we always seem to end up arguing.

I thought this kinda thing would be something couples get excited about and look forward to but he seems to HATE it when I bring it up.

I brought it up a few days ago and he was saying things like you can't guarantee your income, the pressure is all on me, I'm never renting etc

But he knew when we met I wouldn't have a set guaranteed income every month as I'm self employed, and he knew how much I earnt. 

He made me feel kinda worthless, like my job was crap.

Anyway am I being unreasonable because of my low income?

Or should he be more flexible?

Thanks 


*****UPDATE*******

Thank you to everyone who responded, you have been really kind and thoughtful with your responses.

I talked to him and he's changed his tune. Now he would consider renting in the future.

He apologised for demeaning my job and income, he said he didn't mean it to sound like that and he said he was sorry for being selfish.

He has done this before where he backtracks and says everything I want to hear and then nothing changes. So this could be one of those times..

I'm going to have a good long think and Make a decision

Thanks again! Don't worry I won't be posting this again lol

We had an argument caused by him a couple months ago and before it even begun, he knew he was in the wrong and said sorry before I could begin to react. I tried to ignore what he did like I normally do, but overtime after he kept saying how bad he felt, I started to think about how it was quite bad what he did. However, he told his best friend a slightly different story.  
 
He made out that I overreacted and went nuts on him over something minor and that he was innocent. His friend licks his ass and was like wtf, you okay though?, that's all she ever does, ask if he's okay. He then joked about how I said she liked him - it's clear by what she says and how she acts. She found it funny but she was being quite hostile at the same time saying how she hated people (me). I was shocked he'd told her so much, things that should be kept personal and he was  siding with her against me but he completely licks my ass when he does something to hurt me, but she doesn't see that side.  
 
Another thing is, she  checks on my statuses and if I sound a bit off, she messages him asking if he's okay, like an excuse to talk to him. 
She says that I'm a lucky girl, how she misses him and how she wishes she could find someone like him (so obvious)  
Another thing is, it appears he's deleted her message history since before Christmas and another girls. 
 
Now this other girl last contacted him two days after we got together. The first few messages seem like she only wants to be good mates with him and keep in touch, however the last one read along the lines of I had good reason to be jealous and scared of losing you. You've found someone else. I'm happy for you. but he never replied. It was obvious she was expecting something more from him and he knew about it. We talk about everything so it's weird he never told me about her.
 
I want to know how I can tell him that I'm not happy about this. I'm finding it hard to bring it up because I feel bad for looking through his messages in the first place, though he knows I suffer with depression, paranoia and anxiety. It's the first time I've ever looked through his messages in the year we've been together. I feel if I told him, he wouldn't care about what's bothering me, he'd just go nuts about me invading his privacy which I wish I never did now. 
 
Don't comment if you're going to tell me he's horrible and that I should leave him. I know this guy, you don't and I view things differently to you. This is nothing compared to cheating and is something that can be resolved, without taking the easy option.

I just got out of a six year relationship, and he is getting out of a four year one. We're already very serious, I think because of how long we've been on the verge of dating but never brave enough to say something. 

Also, because he has a son. From what I read, you cannot go into that casually. He also has another child on the way, with the girl he just left. (I know that sounds bad, but their relationship hasn't been right for a long time. He has no intention of leaving his child, but his ex is a different story). 

They are still living together, because he needs to save a bit more to afford a place on his own. He and I are supposed to be getting a place in January.

At first, I thought that I would be fine with him having kids. I love kids, I plan to have a few. Plus I am adopted, and I have a stepmother that I love more than my own mom. I've seen first hand that blood doesn't matter. 

Yesterday my boyfriend and I had plans to hang out all day. Something came up with his first ex and he was able to have his son (5) for the day. So he cancelled our plans. He asked me first, which was nice. And I told him it was fine- it's more important that his son spends time with him. Plus my boyfriend said that he would make it up to me, by seeing me that night instead. 

At around the time I'm getting ready to leave my house, my boyfriend texted me that he was soo tired. I asked if he was canceling and he flipped out at me, saying that I have no faith in him. 

After a half hour of arguing (via text so it probably wasn't actually half an hour) it came out that I was right- he was canceling. So now I'm upset that I'm being ditched again. But I feel like I'd be alright if he'd handled it better. Like if he'd talked to me about it instead of trying to set up his cancel. Or if he'd called to tell me. Or if he'd offered an apology and tried to set up a different day. 

We argue about this for a while. Because I'm angry, it's late, and we're both tired. He mentions that I should have just assumed that he'd see me again soon. And I said why would I? This night was supposed to be making up for not seeing each other earlier and he's cancelling without any explanation or anything. Why would I feel okay with that?

Then he tells me BTW I shouldn't have to make up seeing my kid to you. At first I was just mad because that isn't what I meant at all. I think he should see his kid, whenever he has the chance. But I do still think that if he cancels on me, that it's within reason to want to set something else up. Plus- he's the one that said he'd make it up to me in the first place.

At this point, I've thought more about his BTW comment. While I feel that his kid is important, I want to be important too. Can't we both be number one in his life? Isn't that how relationships work, when you get married and then have kids? 

I think everyone involved should be equally important. Even though it's early on, I've been in both their lives a long time. And he's talking about marriage- if he is getting that serious already, shouldn't I be on an equal playing field as the two of them?

I was her 3rd boyfriend, and she once told me (to my surprise) that she'd never had any casual encounters with any guy that wasn't her boyfriend, not even a kiss. While I didn't mind her sexual history either way, I felt this gave a certain sincerity to our relationship


This summer was very tough for us, we both worked a lot and didn't have time to see each other much. At one point I rarely spoke to her or even called her, and told her I wasn't sure what would happen as I planned to move away and work after graduating. For that time I was admittedly a bad boyfriend, and after another week of being distant she told me she wanted to go on a break (codeword: break up) and admitted when pressed that she had feelings for someone else. I was really angry and some nasty words were exchanged for a day or two before I left things.


For that time I didn't cope with being single well at all, as I never have. I live at home in a fairly rural area so didn't see or meet anyone that I wanted, didn't date or kiss another person even. My confidence was shot and I've been depressed about a number of things, so I was hardly a prime candidate for moving on.


After about a month and a half she contacted me again to get back together. She was genuine about it, and I was cautious but happy she felt this way. However (though I never directly asked) it was obvious from the offset that she's been with quite a lot of other guys since we went on a break, in that relatively short space of time. I'm not feeling too great about this, partly because of my own insecurity, and that the relationship just doesn't feel the same anymore. I was also told there's a chance things may be awkward when I visit her in college because of what she's been up to, and I'm uncomfortable with this too. 


I don't know how to deal with my feelings, and while she's 100% committed to our relationship since we've been back together I've been having crippling doubts that I can go through with it. I feel like I have no real choice though; she's the only thing in my life at the minute. Should I just get over myself or do I have valid concerns that need addressing?

12043,Relationships,24yhcd,"I have been dating S. for 3 months and its been mostly great. I live a half an hour to forty-five minutes away from him by public transportation. I have a roommate, while he has his own room, so it makes more sense for me to go to his place, especially during the week when we all work and my roommate needs to sleep (I don't have a common area, just a bedroom, a hallway and a tiny kitchen). 

So, I make the commute over to see him around 3 times a week, and I don't begrudge either the time or the cost. I just really like seeing him and spending time with him. However, he regularly will fall asleep halfway into the evening. If it happened occasionally, I wouldn't really mind at all. However, it happens often enough that its been getting to me. I start thinking Why did I spend time and money just to sit here and look at my phone? 

The same thing happened last night and this time, I kind of felt a little upset and so I left around 11pm. (He'd been sleeping for 2 hours). I tried to explain that I felt kind of useless there and that I honestly had things to do at home, if I wasn't hanging out with him. I know he was a little annoyed with me, and I completely understand that he can't help that he's tired or falling asleep. But, I can't help that I feel a little low priority if he always wants to sleep when I'm there.

He suggested only seeing each other over the weekend, but I really can't be in a relationship with someone I only see once a week. And we both have other social obligations on the weekend, already. I suggested downgrading our relationship from a committed one back to a more casual thing, and he said things like this should be discussed in person. We're having dinner tonight, and I'm not really sure what I want to say. 

I guess my goal would be to make my needs (seeing him during the week where we spend meaningful time together) clear while also not making it seem like I'm blaming him or angry at him.

12045,Relationships,1l26rt,"Two weeks ago, after years of wanting to move to New York City, I finally did. 


My girlfriend is extremely supportive and insisted that I go because she has been able to experience living abroad while I'd never lived outside of my home state. She's doing an internship and finishing her doctorate back home while I'm living in NYC, a good time to do so because she'll be extremely busy with work/school. The hope is that she'll move here at the end of her internship/degree, but she's not keen on the city at all. We've been together six months as of yesterday-- and shit hit the fan last night while we were Skyping.


I'm subletting an apartment while I job hunt, but the sublet is up on October 1. I started mentioning last night that I need to find something more permanent, maybe signing a year-long lease in December when rent is cheaper and I have a job lined up. She became upset and said that I wasn't considering her in my longterm plans. I really hadn't meant any harm by what I said... I DO need a place to live and can't necessarily wait to find out what she's doing because the apartment market here is extremely competitive. I fully admit that I understand why she would feel that way based on what I said.


This morning I woke up to text messages from her explaining how upset she is, how she doesn't know if she can be in this anymore, how she has a lot think about. She said she feels like I'm not considering her, like I wouldn't move somewhere for her and won't make sacrifices for our relationship. The fact is though that I've been here two weeks after saving and working for years to get to this point so, yes, I am hesitant to give up this dream that I just achieved. At the same time I totally understand where she's coming from and how it could look this way.

We've been together for six months which, admittedly, is not a very long time. But she's the first woman I've seriously discussed marriage and kids with. I could see this being a very longterm relationship. She's the first woman who has really loved me unconditionally and I've seen amazing growth in my life with her support. My life has been great with her in it. We get along well, have similar drive and expectations. I love spoiling her and really try to be a good boyfriend to her. We're both very much on the same page about a lot of things, though perhaps not everything. This has such great potential and I love her, which makes all of this very difficult for her and for me. 

When I think about things though, I do question where my head is. I'm mostly scared about her moving here for me. I don't WANT her to move somewhere that she doesn't want to be and doesn't like. I know it's selfish, but it puts a LOT of pressure on the relationship and me. I want to be with her, absolutely, but I feel like her moving here is very final. I feel like it's an expectation of a ring and a wedding in the not distant enough future. This city wouldn't be a great place for her but it feels like home to me and I've already had tremendous job opportunities in my short job search. 

I really don't know what to do here. I love this woman and we have a fantastic relationship, but part of me also realizes that geographically we're on different pages and chronologically (because she's a few years older) we're at different points in life. I want to work through it, but I don't know if it's the intelligent thing to do or not.

12052,Relationships,1v6bgb,"Short background: We were friends in high school. I moved away for several years. When I came back to my home town we reconnected and fell pretty easily into a great relationship.

He's sensitive, smart, we have a lot of likes/dislikes in common. He is going back to school for a degree in IT and I love that he is motivated, career oriented (now) and wants to travel.

But sometimes I catch myself cringing when I'm out with him. This sounds so horrible but here it is:
He grew up very very poor. After high school he had a (short lived) problem with drugs and went to jail for possession for 8 months. Since then he has worked really hard at a blue collar job to pay his way through college in order to work in IT (his dream job and a big common like for us both) Because of his childhood and brush with the law he hasn't traveled much or been in a professional setting.

Most of the pictures on his fb profile are of him in sleeveless t-shirts, smoking cigarettes, drinking. He just comes of as..kind of a redneck. When we're out sometimes he lays on his southern accent kind of thick and says inappropriate things for the occasion. His FB has posts about smoking weed, beer, and pictures of half naked girls.  If we're going to see his friends he wears cut off t shits, ratty shoes and a trucker-type hat. When we go out together or with my friends he wears nicer clothes and vans he bought when we were together.

I haven't ever explicitly asked him to change anything. He mentioned he needed new clothes and asked if I would go shopping with him. I went and guided him without insisting or being pushy. I know it's important for someone to feel comfortable in their own clothes. I'll admit though I have commented on his shoes before. I'm not about having expensive stuff but he wears the same old ratty black tennis shoes everywhere we go and I mentioned that maybe it's time for some new shoes. 

I like to have fun and relax..it's not that I want to be with someone who is stuffy and boring but I worry about our different backgrounds becoming an issue.

When I'm alone with him we have so much fun. We talk about the books we're reading, tech stuff, movies (mutual obsession), where we'd like to travel..He makes me laugh and it's always stimulating conversion..it's almost an entirely different side of him. But I'm secretly very nervous about bringing him to a work event or having him linked to me on FB where a co-worker, client, or boss might see his posts/pictures.

If it is a legit concern then how can I approach this topic without hurting his feelings? I sincerely think it would help him too to become more professional / sophisticated because he's working toward a degree in IT. But I already see that he wears different clothes/ acts differently around his friends than he does me..and that worries me too, I don't want to be with someone who can't be themselves around me. That's not fair to him.

She then didn't want to talk for a bit and then when we did I found out I made her feel in her words the worst girlfriend ever. We argued a bit, I kept insisting it was all of my fault (Which it is) and then she said it was her fault because she was stupid and retarded. I kept telling her she wasn't and I promised her that she wasn't but she just would not let me take the blame so it kind of just ended without a resolution there.

12054,Breakups,1qmv00,"**We were each other's first serious relationship, and first intimate relationship. We've been dating since August of last year, but now we're in college and it's just not working out anymore.**



In the beginning, we were honestly a good match. We didn't argue and we could talk for hours about anything. We both wanted it to work out, and tried to make it work. We were both extremely independent and driven, but I was always more emotional and sensitive.

---

**The Problem:**

Some time before college started there was no more communication. 

He would go days on end without speaking to me, without texting me, and he would seldom make plans to involve me. He got caught up in his new Fraternity, his new friends, and his new academic life. All of a sudden, he started making less effort on his part to keep me happy. He started showing less interest and I seldom knew what was going on in his life. There was no more Romance from his end. 


I tried to hard to be patient with him, I really did. I tried to give him his space, I tried to keep a conversation, and I really tried to encourage him and help make things easier. I tried to be someone he could count on to be there for him.


But I made mistakes too. I became upset and confused, I started snapping, and every once in a while I would show up uninvited--terrible, I know. *I know that I shouldn't have done that*, but I was so upset that I never saw him. I felt so helpless that it made me fear every action I took.


He said the only thing he wanted me to do was to be supportive, but no matter how supportive I was, he eventually stopped accepting it. He didn't want me to compliment his achievements, he didn't want me to encourage him, and he basically just didn't want me around. 

---

**The Result:**

I really tried to tell him my needs, and in a clear manner. He just wouldn't do anything about it. He always acted like it was more of a job than something he wanted to do for me. He refused to compromise most of the time, stating that he shouldn't have to change himself. I couldn't understand how just sending me a text after days of not talking was something he had to change himself for.


All these events triggered my depression, which made things worse. Now, I don't have the willpower to talk anymore. I don't feel like trying anymore. I spent the last four months crying because the person I cared about refused to acknowledge me in public half the time, but I still cared. I haven't had the emotional energy to force myself to be happy for his sake.

He was never like this before, and it just hurt so much. 


I finally started talking to a mutual good friend of ours. My boyfriend vented to him and said extremely hurtful things that I found out about though the friend. He basically blamed me for being too emotional and the only reason he didn't know how to break up with me yet was that he didn't want to deal with me crying. He went on to talk about how he wanted a fresh relationship with a girl that actually had a body and how he would have rather just dated the other girl from the beginning. I may have said hurtful things, but I would have never disrespected him like that.

At the same time, it's not in my heart to become bitter with him. I'm not the kind of person to hold a grudge for all of this. I'm sure he had his reasons and didn't know how to deal with it.


---


**The bottom line is, I *know* this needs to happen.**

But I'm just so scared, remorseful, and terrified of losing someone I've put so much into. The worst part is, it's like he's given up hope and just doesn't give a damn if it happens. He's just so tired of arguing and not being interested by me anymore that he wants to move on.

**I want more than anything for it to be on good terms**, and I desperately want up to just go back to being friends. He was someone I could talk to and count on, and I want that--just without the relationship. I don't know what to say that will make him realize that that is something I want from this. *I want him to know that even though we couldn't work out, I'm not angry and upset at him anymore. I want the best for him no matter what. No matter how he treated me at the end, I'll try to move past it.*

**My question to Reddit is what I do/don't say to him to convey this message? I do not want to be hostile or demanding, my point is to end up as friends so we can have a more positive relationship and move past this.**

12055,Relationships,2nxdh0,"I'll try to keep this short. (EDIT: It's not).

My wife and I dated for two years and have been married for three. 

During the dating phase I always made it clear to Lydia (name changed) I love kids, I want kids, if I have problems conceiving I'll adopt, etc.

Lydia has always agreed and said she wanted kids too. It was one of the main reasons why I decided to marry her.

During premarital counseling we agreed we would start trying for a baby after 1-2 years of marriage.

So we tied the knot and were very happily married until about 6 months ago when we decided to stop using birth control. We wern't *trying* to get pregnant per se, but we wern't taking precautions to avoid it either.

Lydia started becoming withdrawn and moody. She wasn't her normal happy and affectionate self. She started refusing to be intimate with me more and more with excuses that ranged from passable (I'm tired, not in the mood, etc.) to just plain weird (I'm too gassy, I need to shower).

She wasn't awful by any means but there was definitely something wrong and she herself couldn't seem to figure out what it was.

6 weeks ago I gently suggested she might want to try therapy to have someone help her work through whatever issues she was having, and that if she needed me at all, I would be there for her.

Well last night she sat me down and said we needed to talk. She looked very uncomfortable and then said going to therapy had helped her realize she doesn't want kids. At all. Ever. In any way. No adoption, no fostering, no natural anything.

She said she had just told me she wanted kids because she thought it was the reasonable thing to do and agreed to it because she knew how happy it would make me and plus everyone does it.

She said when we stopped using protection she felt sad and resentful. She said she was so very happy with me, that she loves me more than anything in the world...and that includes children. She says she just can't fathom bringing a baby into our relationship and changing it forever. She's very happy the way things are now. She likes being able to sleep in on the weekends with me, to go on spontaneous trips, to spend our money as we please on ourselves (within reason) and to also have the independence to have her own life and hobbies.

She says if we had a baby that would all change and our relationship would never be the same again, and her life would be changed forever. And she doesn't want to make that kind of commitment to anyone or anything except me and our dog and cat.

She even freely admitted I honestly think I'm just to selfish to be a parent. I love you so very much, but I don't want anything to come between us or change the life we have right now. I would just resent anything that did.

I couldn't say anything. I was completely taken aback and gutted all at once. I managed to choke out a thanks for her being honest and that I wanted space to process, which she has been giving me while trying to be sweet by making me breakfast, ironing my clothes, etc.

I've been in shock and just numb but now I'm starting to feel things. I am absolutely devestated and heartbroken. But I am also feeling just this surge of **fury** at Lydia. I feel like I was manipulated, lied to and decieved just so she could lock me down.

I love my wife. We've honestly had a problem free relationship and marrige until now, and even during the rocky 6 months we never had a horrible argument once. She honestly is one of a kind and I have felt so lucky to have found and been with her. She is the light of my life.

I'm also completely destroyed and pissed the fuck off. And I don't even know if that's even ok to feel, because I know Lydia honestly believes she didn't intentionally lie to me, that she merely went along with what I wanted because she loved me and wanted me to be happy. She's just now realizing she can never be happy with kids in the picture.

I'm so fucked up I don't know what to think. I don't know if I should try to save my marriage or if it can even BE saved. Lydia understands my heartbreak and I know she is remorseful and sorry. She honestly deeply and truly loves me with all her heart, she just doesn't want to alter our current status quo by having a child.

I don't WANT a divorce, but I'm wondering if maybe I need to go ahead and file for it. I don't think Lydia understands that by saying she doesn't want kids, she just permanently changed our relationship whether we have a baby or not. I think she just wants me to realize we don't need kids to have a happily ever after. I can't imagine living without Lydia...but I can't imagine giving up having kids either. What do I do with something like that?!?

I don't even know if I can be with someone who I feel lied to me and tricked me on one of the most important decisions a couple can make. But I feel like I'm a bad husband and person if I leave her and choose non-existent children over her.

Is our marriage salvageable? Or is divorce our only option?

**TL;DR Wife has decided she doesn't want kids even though she knows I've always wanted them. Feel crushed and angry. I love my wife and want to make it work, but I don't know if I can and if I just need to bite the bullet and file for divorce**

**EDIT: There seems to be confusion with many people debating if my wife lied to me. My wife openly admitted she had never been sure about having kids, faked her enthusiasm for having children and thought she should want them just because I did and she loved me. She also admitted she didn't want to risk losing me (while we were dating) by saying she wasn't sure she ever wanted kids. She never once communicated this to me and always told me she loved kids too, wanted them, our marriage wouldn't be complete without them etc. And no I'm not going to try and force her to change her mind.

12056,Relationships,3bcihm,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 years and, despite the problems we have had, I feel that we are pretty serious about spending the rest of our lives together. We have lived together for three months shy of two years and have been sharing most costs 50/50. This includes rent, utilities, cable, and groceries. We pay all of our own personal bills (e.g., car payments, insurance, phone bills, gas, etc). He has always made more money than I have, but he recently accepted a job with a salary that is actually more than double my salary (I'm not sure if figures matter here, but if anyone wants to know, say something!). He is able to save hundreds of dollars each month, just leased a new luxury car, and I live paycheck to paycheck. He is always very willing to help out his mother, who does not make much money and has two pre-teen kids. He often helps them with things that they don't necessarily need, but rather he helps them to afford luxuries or recreational things. 

I do have some credit card debt that I am working hard to pay off. I have been more frugal and forgo things I really want because I'd like to improve my credit. I am completely aware that MY debt is MY fault/burden and I am NOT asking for his help to pay it off. 

In order for me to get ahead and be able to save money, I would like him to pay more of the rent, perhaps a 60/40 or 70/30 split. Or I would be content if he could pay more of the utilities. Another factor in this is that I would like to go back to graduate school to further my career. I would like to do this full time while working part time, but this would require him to help me financially because I cannot handle the stress of working full time and going to school part time.

I have tried to talk to him about this a few times, but to no avail. He usually brushes it off and says something like, I don't know... or he will semi-whine, making it very clear it is not an idea he is on board with. 

My question to you, Reddit, is: Would it be unreasonable for me to ask him to pay more of certain expenses like rent or utilities?

**TL;DR** My boyfriend makes more than double my salary but feels that we should split everything 50/50.

EDIT: I don't think I came off as I intended with regards to the credit thing. My credit is just a factor of all this and I understand that asking him to pay more for utilities while I get my shit together is an indirect way of asking him to help me with debt. Thank you for allowing me to see that! What's more important is if I go back to graduate school, then in 2-3 years I can more or less double my income, which will help him AND me in the long run. So, all things considered (i.e., the length and seriousness of our relationship, the plan to get married one day), I feel that it would be courteous for him to help. I am not entitled and I certainly do not plan to leave him if he doesn't want to help; we have put way too much into our relationship for me to do that.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are also asking, What changed? You were fine with 50/50 when you moved in.

12057,Relationships,3f4pdw,"  I have been acquaintances with said person since high school and I was a jerk to her.  I teased her and, for a short period of time, was just generally dickish.  This ended quickly and there really is not much more to say on that matter.


  So for the next 9 or so years we casually crossed paths,  I am friends with her brother still to this day, but my relationship with his sister has been basically nonexistent until recently.  I certainly developed some feelings for her over this time.  We have a ton in common but our original interaction in school kind of made everything in between slightly awkward and weird.  Our families are relatively close as well, our parents interact.  There has been a lot of pressure for us for years to just hang out with each other and we recently went out and it was great, much to my shock.  It was not an awkward outing at all.  This was not a date,  we discussed it.  She decided it was not.                            

  This brings me to the real core of my problem and questions on how to proceed.  She is. like me, kind of introverted and socially awkward.  I am almost certain she has severe body issues/self-esteem issues.  She does not like to be touched it seems.  I am also almost certain that she has never been in that situation before and was incredibly nervous when I asked her if it was a date.  It felt like a date in pretty much every way.  She's never had a relationship and claims to never have wanted one either.  How can I get her to open up to me at all?  I don't thin she was truthful to me about her feelings out of nervousness.

12058,Relationships,3a2ei1,"We were together for about 6 months last year when we decided to take a break. We lived on the east coast and i graduated in December with what seemed to be a great job offer on the west coast as soon as I got out. She's only just now finishing junior year at our university. Long distance seemed like something that would be rough and we weren't sure if we could make it or not, but we ended up talking together pretty regularly and visiting each other a few times during my stay anyway.


Two months ago, we decided to just go ahead and make it an official thing again; we had been behaving like we were still dating anyway and it looked like we could handle long distance. On top of that, it turns out I, as well as a lot of other coworkers, got laid off three weeks ago anyway. Hooray! So now I'm back home because I still have some pretty solid connections to find work in the DC area.


The entire time we were dating and on a break, she would consistently update twitter about us, like if we had an argument she'd update with something along the lines of: it's just hard to talk to him sometimes. Nothing specific and I'm always referred to as 'him' in all her tweets. She'd do the same thing if we had a nice conversation just before bed as well.


I never noticed it because I don't have twitter, but a couple of my fraternity brothers have been texting me and have mentioned it every now and again so I've decided to actually look through her twitter. Almost everytime we talk, my girlfriend makes a twitter update about it. She tweets maybe 20 times a day about a bunch of other random stuff that I don't really care about, but I figure maybe the frequency of her tweets may be relevant here.


It bothers me. I've always been a very, very private person. I rarely, if at all, talk to people about my feelings or anything like that. Now I find out she's been tweeting about every single time we talk, even the times I am trying to be intimate and talk about my feelings with her. It's not easy for me, and suddenly I'm worried about anything I say to her because it might be broadcasted on twitter to all of her friends.


I haven't been in any serious relationships before this one. I'm not sure what to expect and maybe all girls are like this, but my personal space is invaluable to me. I'm embarrassed when i get texts from old college buddies telling me they know what my girlfriend and I got into last night because they read her twitter talking about what a perfect night it was or whatever little meaningless fight we got into.


I'm not really sure what to do. Is this normal girl shit and i need to just learn to accept it? Or should I talk to her about not tweeting about me in general? I feel less inclined to tell her anything about my feelings when she's just going to tweet about them five minutes later. I have not yet talked to her about this at all but I'm worried if i do, she'll get upset and blow up on twitter and facebook about it.


I want to stress: I am a very, very private individual. I update my Facebook status pretty frequently (maybe once every couple days), sure, but usually it's just bullshit one liners or something funny I may have thought of that day. Never anything actually personal. 



Tl;dr: my girlfriend tweets about everything we do or say and I feel like I have no privacy anymore.

12059,Relationships,31km5q,"So we're in university. In her first year she met a guy (Jack) and they were best friends, eventually she broke up with her boyfriend and they had a fling for a few months. She ended up back with her ex and their entire whatevership went down the toilet. They were arguing for the last two years on and off, but there was always some emotional depth between them.

We started our relationship four months ago (it's our final year here) after she broke up with her ex. We didn't tell anyone for a while, but at the time he admitted he still had feelings for her, she started pushing him away because of it and now there's no communication between them at all.

She told me she still has feelings for him after three years about a month ago, and if anything it actually made our relationship stronger. 

Recently though, I'm worried about her. She keeps convincing herself that he's following her whenever we go out, when in actual fact we live in a really small student town where it's inevitable to bump into people you know. I asked her if this is about her feelings for him and she got really offended. She still stares at him from a distance, and I know there's a part of her that still wants to rebuild the bridge between them. A while ago when she saw him she suddenly became crazy frisky when we got back home, and then she talked about him after we had sex.

I've put up with it thus far because I know that she'd never cheat on me, emotionally or physically. We do talk about him when she needs to but it feels like a competition with someone she had sex with a few times a few years ago. How can she still have feelings for someone from THREE YEARS AGO when they've just been arguing since and she didn't even love him?

Managing to convince herself that he's following her is just too much, and as much as I'm actually happy in our relationship despite this, it just sounds like a load of rubbish. If I try to talk some sense into her, she just ends up getting really defensive over it.

12060,Breakups,3f1jju,"My girlfriend and I met while at college last year and started having sex almost immediately but we weren't official until the start of second semester. I am not a very emotional person at all and she is the most emotional person I have ever met which has caused some strain between us. Twice she has started crying (while drunk) and refused to tell me why (I later found out why) which made me really mad and I now know that this made her feel uncomfortable telling me how she feels. 

Fast forward to the end of the year our relationship becomes long distance because we live in different (neighboring) states. At first we were fine I visited her one week after the last day and stayed at her house for almost a week. On the first night we spent together I told her I loved her which I sincerely meant and still do and I knew that she had at this point been in love with me potentially for months already. I saw her again a little less than a month later made the three hour drive down to visit her and then drove her back to my house to meet my family. She stayed for a few days we enjoyed our time together and were having FANTASTIC sex the whole time. She was originally going to take a bus back home but her family was uncomfortable with this idea but agreed to it, knowing this and having an event to attend the next day somewhere close to her house decided to just drive her back myself and spend another day with her.

2 weeks later I go down and visit her again, at this point I have driven to her 3 hours each way 3 times, she share a car with her sister and her parents who bought the car didn't feel comfortable with her making the drive on her own (which is understandable she's a terrible driver). And this was on short notice she just asked me to come down I had a few days off so I agreed and spent most of the week with her while I was there. While I was down there I get a call from my boss and I no longer have a job or source of income, I was upset but figured now I would be able to spend more time with her and be able to focus on my summer classes.

Last week she throws a birthday party for my former roommate and her best male friend at the place she is renting for school. I go there a day early and stay an extra day to spend time with her but something feels off. The first night she starts to feel sick, second night is the party. Around 1 am she takes me upstairs and tries giving me a BJ (yay me) but when I drink I know that I will almost never cum so I tell her to stop (I know what the fuck was I thinking I'm still mad at myself for this) and if I lay down I also get the spins. I didn't throw up but felt the need to and wound up just going to sleep. Party continues and a friend of a friend I invited comes by at 3:30 am doing cocaine and bleeding profusely, there are a bunch of other guys down stairs who eventually get him and his friends to leave. Obviously when I found out about this I was upset at my friend and so was she. I confronted him about it when I found out he said he didn't tell him where the party was, whatever I don't really care (at the time).

Day after the party we're having sex but I go soft, this upsets her and makes her feel self-concious and I being upset at myself don't give her the attention she deserves from this. I stay another night with her and the same thing happens the next day. This is unusual for me and has me worried still I don't know whats wrong.

For a few days we haven't spoken much and primarily through texting and Snapchat, I feel she's kind of been brushing me off. Yesterday she calls me crying saying I don't treat her right and that in bed I'm not giving her enough attention, she said I barely make an effort to get her wet anymore (there's a grain of truth there I haven't been doing as much foreplay lately). And she says she thinks we should take a month off before school and see how we feel when we get back, that somethings felt weird lately, that she doesn't think I really love her and that she thinks I'm bored with her and that she doesn't even make me hard anymore. 

This pisses me off immensely, my 21st birthday is next week and we had planned to spend it together and see Cirque du Soleil together at Foxwoods. She said she thinks I have been treating her more of as a friend with benefits which I disagree with she says I don't make an effort.

Maybe I'm blind but I've felt lately that I was the one making the effort more. We talk on the phone for almost two hours and I try and convince her over and over again that there's no point in taking a month off and not talking that that would only distance us but she's adamant. 

Finally I see there's no point in arguing anymore and I relent but insisting that the time be less than a month. I say goodbye I love you so does she.

I feel that this is going to do irreparable damage to our relationship and that it will only make things worse, I don't want to break up but I feel like this is a pre-breakup. she is my first girlfriend and I do sincerely love her. What should I do? Do I not contact her, send her flowers, apologize for the millionth time? I know she loves me probably more than I love her and can't understand why she doesn't just want to talk it through.

12064,Breakups,3hde6j,"She had moved out to Ithaca new york for me. She helped me with letters and emails and family and friends. She supported me. She loved me. I let the most precious person I've ever met crumble beneath the weight of dating me. I really should have quit. I should have run to her and squeezed her close and given us everything I had but I let my community convince me that I needed something trivial to be complete. I was a different PERSON. I was a MUMMY. 
         Post-test, all of a sudden, I had 20 friends and I hated my haircut, my clothes, my apartment, and how they made me feel. I hated my mantras and ambitions and attitude almost immediately after this test was completed.. She left me. That was it. 3 years.

I bought her flowers. She had no thoughts for me on the phone and wouldn't meet. I am not in love with you anymore.  She hardly listened to me speaking. I was wasting her time. I was a pitstop before she climbed into her car and set off on her own experiences and stresses. I wasn't her past anymore, just a not-so-familiar voice. She never even saw the flowers I'd bought. I'd searched my soul to find the right words and right items to bring along. please, give me an afternoon, just give me an evening to date and love you one last time, it can be different, it should always have been on the right path, I truly am worth that time. 
           She forgets as I did that there was something real to this. She doesn't see the glue. She doesn't know that we weren't, we never were, smiling starry eyed at an empty relationship. We are blessed to know that the other has ever existed. Not three and a half weeks ago she was crumbling and clenching my waste and crying and relenting her fight, sobbing and saying that she was sorry and that she was still in love with me. 

I want her to be happy and my heart aches for the lost opportunity of course . I have what is inside of me piping and ready to give.  The time I spent subdued and pulseless are confusing as all hell, but they aren't an enigma from an outside perspective. I was cold. I was distant. I wanted to control my surroundings and secure a pleasant footing. I wanted to treat her like she couldn't be volatile or crop up with time sinks and demand my attention. I now want her to see that she shouldn't ever let her parents date her ex's. That she is the only person who would be spending their days in my arms and presence. That it would take time, but that I would write them each letters. That I would win them back grueling for us like I should have wanted to do. Working for us as I had for the nonsense these past few years. I want to take a bullet for this moment and I want to seize what we had with all I have. I can't do that through boundaries. I can't do it without causing her pain, because she can't see my intentions burning. I sit alone weighing my behaviors one over the other hypothetical. Reading our conversations and face palming and belly laughing at my woefully preventable circumstances. This was a war to be fought six months ago. What can I do? I can't imagine having sex again, or losing this entitlement to what we should be enjoying together. I want my love back. I don't want to give up, and I know that her actions communicate a need for space and a desperation for distance. But she was so tender. I can't help but think that she'd like who I'd become loving me. I exude what I am saying now. I was such a wet blanket for a year. My eyes would tell the whole story. She refuses to see them and I refuse to violate that request.. she initiates and corresponds by text from time to time (occasionally even when it seems like a moment of vulnerability). 
             I can't bring her flowers and letters and memories. She'll likely be sitting in the living room with a man she's trying out. I don't and won't handle that correctly. I won't risk seeing that, even if her sex life is actually oddly further from my tender regions than I would have imagined.

12069,Breakups,36cvgu,"We went to a barbeque hosted by my best friend last night(5 pm).  We rock, paper, scissor-ed to see who would be dd-ing that night and he won.  I had a couple drinks that night since I was DD and stopped drinking a few hours in.  I was hanging out an catching up with my friends when two of them came up dragging a very drunk Alex(9:00pm).  He was doing really badly and it was then that I remembered he had inventory for work (5am wake up) in the morning.  

We get Alex in the car and I start to drive him back to our place.  He keeps saying he’s sick (going to be?) and saying that I should break up with him.  After hearing this on repeat for a while I get upset and ask if he actual wants to break up.  He yells the word yes.  This took me by surprise since our relationship has been a little bumpy but never bad.  I get him home drag him into the tub trying to get him to relax.

  He punches me a few times, rips my shirt, and starts yelling that he needs the bed.  I let him go to bed where he proceeds to vomit all over himself and it.  Spend the rest of the night cleaning up his clothing and the sheets while he’s passed out on the bean bag chairs.  I couldn't sleep.

When he woke he had no memory of the night and needed to get dressed for work.  I explained what happened.  He said he was going to be late if he stayed to talk about it, he seemed a little upset by it all but was in a hurry.  I let him leave for work.

I don't know what to do now.  The closest thing to this that he has done is about a month ago he got really drunk before I got home.  While drunk he peed on clothing I had just washed and when i finally got him to stop he said he felt trapped in this relationship.  That was a big fight.

My relationship with my SO is pretty great, we've been dating for about a year, but there are some things that I just want to keep to myself. Is that okay? Anything that pertains to our relationship/the present/that he asks about the past/etc. I'll always share with him, but there are certain points of my past that I've always just felt were better kept to myself. Example: when I was younger I was kind of wild. Lots of outrageous sex with multiple partners (um, sometimes at once), partying, drugs, etc. I grew out of that pretty quickly and it's never seemed very important to me. I'm sure it would freak more mild SO out and probably just bother him, so why tell him?

12071,Relationships,2y4lot,"I am 18 and met this guy who is 21 around June last year. I liked him a lot and thought he was perfect despite us going to different colleges. I've always been the person to wait till we are serious to have sex BUT we ended up having sex about a month or two after knowing each other because of him sweet talking/convincing me how much he liked me and couldn't get better than me. Worried I was getting used, he told me the next day we would go on a date and it was all going to be fine. I kind of freaked out when he ignored me all day and wouldn't even tell me he was ditching me made up the excuse he was sick, he told me I was being crazy and he was done with me. All a day after we had sex, I was heartbroken because I knew he just wanted to get in my pants all a long. Fast forward to October while I'm at school, he randomly calls me telling me he hasn't stopped thinking about me, he messed up, and was sorry, but that he got scared of commitment. From then on we've been off and on talking, from him calling me once a week and him promising he would come visit me at my school two hours away. It's the same thing every time, he thinks I'm the best girl he could get and it's going to be a better guy for me but never follows through. I just couldn't get over him this all these months even if the calls were minimum or he was drunk. We planned on spending the whole winter break together and rekindling what we had over summer. The first night of winter break I drive to his house which is 40 minutes from my parents house which ended up being over an hour because of a detour. I get to his house finally and he doesn't answer his door. I sat there for 10 minutes calling him and texting him but no answer. I was so pissed off I left and sent him a long angry text about I was never going to speak to him again and what a waste of gas. The next day you expect an apology or excuse right? No, I got nothing but him deleting me off social media. I was done at this point and decided to go on a date with another guy a few days later. While on the date I get a call from him, I leave the car and answer just because I wanted to know why he did it. The whole phone call he sounded so sincere, explained he passed out drunk, and was so embarrassed. He told me he wasn't taking no for an answer and was driving to my house to come get me right that moment to make it up. He hit my sweet spot again and I told my date to take me home. Right then he left to come get me from my house. I primped up, snuck out, and waited for him. He called me saying he was going to arrive in 15 minutes. I stood in the cold for 30 minutes after he said he was suppose to be there. I was so mad I snuck back in and told him the game he was playing was sick and if he didn't call me in the next 5 minutes I was done forever. No response. At about 3 in the morning I get a text saying he got a DUI and never wanted to speak to me again that It was all my fault. I felt terrible but I didn't even know he was drunk. I told myself it was really time to move on now. THEN literally 2 days later while driving around he asks me to come pick him up. Curious to what happened about his DUI, I did. To my surprise he grabs me by the hand in the car with all eye contact and told me what he's done is not okay in a long speech. He goes on to ask me if I still liked him and how he likes me and wants to fix things AGAIN. I was taken back of him confessing his feelings to me in person and just immediately forgotten all the broken promises. After we get to his house he begged me to have sex with him, just like the first time. I was annoyed but agreed to it because he brought up I got a DUI for you, I wouldn't do that for any other girl. After we had sex he asked me so you do like me right? I responded of course and we kissed goodbye and that was that. The next day I wake up to see him tagged with a girl on facebook on his couch when he's sleeping. I first was super upset and even typed a message out to him of how he could be with a girl literally the day after we had sex. After a lot of thought I decided to not send the message. Him call me crazy again? No thanks. I thought if he doesn't talk to me it's closure, I got to see he hasn't changed, isn't perfect, and is still a douchebag. A month passes and I kind of missed him and was hurt he didn't even try to talk to me till one night I finally got a super drunk dial by him. I answered it and wasn't playing games anymore taking a different approach than immediately accepting his apology. I went off on a long speech telling him he really hurt me by not talking to me after we had sex again and keeps getting my hopes up for nothing all he said back is I told him I wouldn't care if he used me and that is why he hasn't talked to me. What? I didn't remember that unless I said that out of pure annoyance. So I apologized blaming myself for us not talking. Then the once a week calls began yet again. This time of him inviting me to stay at his fraternity for the weekend. I would agree and we would make plans that night, but he would never text me the next day to confirm for me to come. Yet his calls were getting more serious, he would tell me every time he loved me and I was the only girl he actually sees himself being with. On Valentine's Day I get a call that he just got done being a his fraternity's date party, he then explained to me that he took one of his good friends that is a girl. I jokingly asked him if he liked her and he said I'm going to be honest you know I have feelings for you of course but yes I have liked her since last year. I was taken back, I didn't know what to say. He continued to tell me that he hung out with her last semester a lot but they never hooked up before but now she apparently has a boyfriend and she was dishonest about it. All I asked if she liked him back and he said I don't know, her friends told me she talked about me a lot and my friends said I talked about her a lot. I could tell he was a little upset about his bad date with her and I was absolutely crushed. I knew we both hooked up with people realistically, we are in college and greek life but those are just one night stands (definitely him more than me). I had no idea he had feelings for another girl let alone his friends knew and it's been going on even longer than him and I have. He continued to say he knew I loved him on the phone, they were better off as friends, and he wish he could of taken me to the date party but didn't know if I would drive down there. Excuses. I was the other girl. I wasn't the special girl to him, I felt like just his back home slam piece. A few weeks later I get calls from him. This time sober. He explains that he thinks we should be together after college when he graduates next year and that I am the girl he wants to marry. He said he knows I forgive him for everything, I deserve better, and he just wants to continue to talk throughout next year. So basically I have to wait a whole year for a title for our relationship because of our distance. I have the choice to go to his college when I transfer but I'm transferring an hour away instead. Basically I don't know what to do. I haven't felt this way about any other guy I can't move on. I love the guy for God knows what reason and I haven't told any other guy that I've loved them before. I know this whole letter has shown how shitty he is but he has so many things going for him and is a really smart guy I wouldn't mind if I ended up with him at all. He's everything I look for despite all the mistakes he's made. I've been working out and seeing if I feel better about myself if I will still be so drawn to him. I don't know how else to handle it. Should I wait for him for a year or what? Moving on is hard and I can't get myself to not answer him when he calls no matter how much I tell myself it'll be bullshit. I just want to know how should I handle this situation.   
TLDR: been talking to this 21 male for 9 months, leading me on to believe we are serious but not putting effort to be serious.

12072,Infidelity,36lhom,"Hello thank you for your interest, This is my first post on /r/ relationships, and i'm just looking for advice on how to handle this situation i'm in right now.

2 months back, i'm hanging out, catching up with an old buddy of mine from highschool. after catching up he has his girlfriend over and we all proceeded to get really drunk. I think you know where this is heading at this point..

However, as things were winding down, my friend invites me to come to bed with him and his girlfriend. I recall their relationship being 'open' on facebook. I also recall having a crush on this girl back in highschool. it was like a drunken dream come true. except however i blacked out right as we started cuddling and her getting handsy with me.

The next day was when we started talking regularly on facebook, i was getting the feeling she was talking to me more than just as a friend, but a potential poly~ candidate. I was okay with this, due to how my friend seemed to frame everything as if he was okay with it. we all started to become pretty good friends over the next 3 weeks, while hanging out on weekends.

The Third weekend was when i had them both over at my place for drinks/outside adventures and whatnot. Again, as things started to wind down my friend invited to cuddle with him and his girlfriend. This time we weren't as drunk as before so i didn't pass out on this opportunity. I kissed her as she was just giving me the biggest fuck me eyes i've ever seen. Nothing was said of my friend, and that was it until we decided to get some sleep.

Halfway through not getting sleep i decided to put my arm around her and she rolled over and we made out and got handsy again. Next day everything seemed just fine with her and my friend. we continued to chat on facebook and everything till she brings up that night that she wasn't in The type of relationship that i thought she was in.

Due to complications with their relationship earlier in the year, i'm going to have to give details for context. She told him that she wanted a poly relationship and that she was going on a date with some guy despite what her boyfriend thought due to things not working out between the both of them. She told my friend that she just made out with the guy and that's it. My friend decides to fuck some girl at a debate tournament he went to that weekend, and in return she fucked the guy she made out with.

This ended up with them being in an open relationship in which the guy is allowed to see other girls, however the girl may not. We confessed feelings for each other after this and i thought it would have been better off for me to just not talk to her but i just couldn't do it. The next morning i told her boyfriend, he didn't take it well whatsoever.

He met me in person and demanded to read our messages as he knew we were talking. He read them and decided that i was innocent and that he was completely done with her. He let me know that i could date her after a couple months or so if i wanted to but advised against it as he convinced me she would do the same to me as he has done to her. He proceeded to show me the letter she sent him regarding wanting to do a poly~ thing with this guy, all it was was her letting him know that she cant stand being in a relationship with no love and just wanted to see if she could feel something with this guy, but wanted to remain in a relationship due to each of them being together for 2 years and being each others first. I asked about the details of why she decided to do this and my friend said 'she was mad because i would joke about her just being a tenga toy (sex toy) to me'.

This shocked me, i didn't want to talk about it with him right there in person because i just didn't know how to handle it, so i disregarded it. That night he went and said goodbye to her by picking her up in his car and proceeding to yell at her the whole time. He told me he was going to do that so she wouldn't just run away.

The next day i invite her to lunch and i let her know that he said that he was okay with us dating after a couple months or so. I then brought up her past and why she did what she did. She said that he was abusive to her and did some fucked up stuff like taking sex further than she consented to, constant jokes about her, weight jokes (she had bulimia throughout junior high), physical abuse like slapping her. She let me know that worse stuff happened but she wasn't comfortable discussing the matter.

With all of this information i could see that she was vulnerable, not only to me pursuing her as a poly~ candidate with my friend, and the enormous connection we had come to find we had online; but most of all, the terrible relationship she was in. she even confessed she crushed on me throughout highschool.

I decided i could trust her despite her cheating on her boyfriend with me. I just felt like i understood why she did what she did, and accepted it. Plus we were drunk and i initiated everything. I was even the one to start talking to her on fb. We were both under the assumption that we would be dating after a couple months.

There are more dramatic details concerning the falling out between us and my friend and how me and my girlfriend actually ended up dating but that's not really relevant to what i want from you guys. I just want input on everything that happened. I'm open to all questions, comments, and criticisms.

I started getting into mdma, lsd, and nitrous, all of which I'm very safe about using and am very careful about dosing. She was totally ok with all of it but didn't partake. Anyways i started to fall in love with her and we started dating. 

Our relationship was basically flawless and wonderful until she started to get annoyed every time I would do drugs other than weed. She made me quit cigarettes but I'm glad she did because that shit woulda killed me eventually. But each time I would do anything else she would get more and more mad. It's gotten to the point where I can't do anything in front of her other than drink because that's the only thing she's comfortable doing.

And I know deep down I would always resent her for forcing this upon me. Oh, I also very recently reconnected with someone that I may love. And I want to try and work things out with her. 

Do I keep trying to convince her? Or do I take the less than savory route. She suggested that she will go at this alone, and I would never have to worry about the baby or her. But I don't want that guilt. Please Reddit, deliver for me on this one :/

The break-up was slow (I tried to convince her to stay), but the ultimate last meeting was civil. My parting words were that I don't regret the relationship, and that she's making a hasty decision without thinking clearly (due to a myriad of other life problems she's having at the moment including failure of getting into a program). 


She said if we could still talk, and I said not unless it's about reconciliation. I don't want to be that shoulder to cry on. She says ok.


I tell her that it's within our best interest to at least give it a fair chance because I felt that it was unfair to our relationship, which was incredibly special (agreed by her as well) to just end it off something like this. I said maybe within a couple months, if you're up for it, and if I'm up for it, you'll know how to contact me. (I'm not moving). 


She says ok.


I'm currently about to engage in the famous No Contact. I'm going to improve on my own life, meet new people, etc. However, since we didn't end on bad blood I want to remain open to the possibility of rekindling. I'm not waiting around for this however.


Questions:

1. Are there any glaring mistakes I should know about in my decision based on the details?


2. I've removed her from twitter, instagram, phone, games, etc. Facebook is the only tricky one. I'm in huge debate on whether to unfriend her, block her, or keep her around but limit news feed.

Because we don't hate each other, I feel as though unfriending or blocking is too hostile and may remove any possibility of getting back with her.

Anyways, my main worry is this:  She's NOT the type to cheat (I've seen her in 2 serious relationships), but she gives her heart away too easily.  She's working hard to change that, but she's only been single for 3 months... after years of constant bad relationships and rebounds.  I just don't want her to rebound on me.

She's also moving in 1 month.  It's to the region I've been planning to move to anyways, and to my #2 city choice.  So it's not THAT bad, but it means we'll be apart for 6-12 months.

Dating her would risk our friendship, and I want to know 2 things:

* Can she stay single for a while longer?  If this means I have more competition, that's ok.

* How's our friendship dynamic going to change once she moves?

So my plan is to wait until ~1 month after she moves before trying to start a relationship.  And I'll still be open to meeting other women in-between (I doubt I'll go for someone else, but if she finds another guy, I don't want to have zero options myself).

Bad stuff:

* Missing a month of relationship time while being in the same state

* Skipping V-day

* She's going to think I'm not interested in her

Is this a good idea?

I feel like my experiences during my first year at the university have changed me as a person and I want to spread my wings and experience all life has to offer without long-term commitment but I feel held back by this girl. I still care for her but I don't know if I love her as much as I used to and, to make matters worse, I've met other girls. Now, with my girlfriend, she was the first person to ever show romantic/sexual interest in me and that's partially why I fell so deeply in love with her in the first place but I've since made myself a more attractive individual and have been noticing more men and women noticing me. I'd never cheat on her or on anyone (unless they did it first) but I really want to experience life outside of commitment.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for around 2 years and have been relatively good at communicating. We have minor arguments and always make up in usually less than a day.

There have been two different occasions however, where we'll have a very simple argument that's most likely just a snide comment, or something taken the wrong way, where she kind of goes off and does her own thing, and we don't talk for a night. The next day (we live together) she kind of explodes with everything she's been frustrated about with us for, for the last 4 or 5 months. Things I'm doing wrong, or that I'm not listening to her, or she does more than I do etc. But when I ask her to bring up specific events, she can't, so and it really bothers me because I feel like I'm under attack without the ability to defend myself.

I don't think I'm a bad communicator, if something bothers me I try to talk about it shortly after it happens and resolve it, this normally goes well.

I've told her before that I dislike when she does this, especially because of an argument that has nothing to do with what she's going off about, and that if she has an issue, she needs to bring it up in a calm manor when we're both feeling okay and ready to have a discussion, not when we're still lingering onto something that has us angry.

Can I get some help? We're not talking to each other right now and tbh I'm really frustrated. Is there something I can be doing better, or can someone help me with explaining why this bothers me? (I've told her this before).

I am really depressed right now.
Everything started on May 31st 2014. I have never had a girlfriend before. I always were shy in terms of my crushes.
However I dealt with it and enjoyed my live even without this unfilled dream.

A years ago (2013) I met Hanna[17 f], a really cute and nice girl. I don't talked to her much. I was really secretly in love with her, but a good friend of mine already made approaches to date her.
One thing lead to another and they were a couple a few months later.
As usually I were slightly depressed, but life was going on for me, and I forgot Hanna[17 f].

After a long and painful breakup caused by Hanna[17 f] I was somehow a bit happy, that I would become the possibility to make approaches at her. However I felt really bad about this thoughts because I had seen, how depressed my friend was. This was around Silvester 2013/14. Early 2014 she had a short relationship with another guy, I don't know, this is important for the story.

In the meanwhile I really forgot about her, because I have not seen her for more than 5 months. But than on May 31st, 2014 I met her at a marksmen's festival, which is a really big thing here (big party 500 visitors all from ~16-25). I danced with her (not close), I spent Hanna[17 f] a few drinks (non alcoholic) and even though she knew many other people there, she stayed the whole party with me. So I texted her two days later and we were texting on a daily basis first over facebook, then she has asked my number, for texting with WhatsApp. She even asked for my Skype name and the last week of June 2014 we were skyping almost every evening. Then we had a date on the 2nd July 2014 and talked a lot.

Things went on, however because of her and mine holidays we couldn't meet each other for 3 weeks.
While we were talking about skype she slowly started to send me (hug) smilies hearts and kisses. The same with WhatsApp.
Everyone who has seen the chat would have thought we are a couple, I don't know what we were.

When both of us were back @home we instantly met us on the 26st July 2014. My parents were on their own holidays so we were alone in our house. We spent the whole day watching series, youtube and playing wii. We hugged each other and cuddled.

In the next night she sent me a text with:I just woke up and had a great dream with you followed by a wall of hearts.
I tried to met her on one of the next days but she says she had to work in the garden, because of her parents.
So our next date was on 31st July one the evening, we were in her room, lying on the bed cuddled almost the whole time, looking straight in each others eyes. 
Now I know that was the moment were I should have kissed her, but I never kissed a girl or even cuddled with her, so this was really new for me. Therefore I were so passive. On the 1st to the 7th I were on another holiday trip with my friends.
It was not far away from home, so we had a date in the next city on 5th August, she travelled 2 hours to see me!

I don't know why, probably because of the funeral of my aunt (died on 1st August funeral on 6th another story) I don't write to her on the 6th.
On the 7th I wrote her back, but she don't answered. She weren't online for 4 days. I thought the worst. On 11st August she finally wrote back, but without kissing smilies and so on. I said I am around at a friends house, so I want to come to her home, but she refuses. I should have done anyway, but I didn't. 

The next days were the most painful in my life, she answered short, if she answered at all. On the 15th I could not seen lots of pics on her facebook site, she kicked me out of her close friends list.

On 17th of August 2014 her facebook relationship status changed to related. Related with the guy she had a short relationship, which I mentioned as important. This guy was texting to her, on our dates she was showing me the messages, I said to her forget about this dick (she said, he had hurt her much), so she don't answered him. I was never a big topic, so I didn't considered this option. This was I punch in my face, which let my fall down on my bed crying the whole day.

The next days and weeks even months were really bad for me. I missed her much, I don't understand what I did wrong, I think I should have been more active, I should have kissed her and so on. But why she is texting me this shit, which makes me believe that I am her total crush and just two weeks later she's been together with a dick, who hurts her. These are the questions I asked my self. To clarify this, I texted with her one last time, on the 18th and she said me, that she were definitely approaching an relationship until the 6th, but why she changed her mind and why she's been together with HIM, I never got an answer and was blocked by her on facebook and WhatsApp.

This is the first part of the story so far, but because of not seeing her a long time I slowly recovered and enjoyed my life more and more.

Two weeks ago I kissed Charlotte[17 f](17 f). It was my first kiss and it was absolutely stunning. It was on a party and she was really attached to me, so we went outside to talk to each other in the car, then she suddenly kissed me. 

We and a few friend were watching different series together and she is in my grade (Hanna[17 f] goes to a different school). So I knew her quiet good. Even her exes and she was hurt a lot and bad in the past. I am on very good terms with her, but she was more a bro for me. Don't get me wrong her character is awesome, but I don't love her and she wasn't my secret crush.
Furthermore in terms of outward appearance she is not what I desire for. She is slightly overweighted (by the way Hanna[17 f] had a perfect body) So I would enjoy to kiss Charlotte[17 f], and maybe having my first time with her, but I don't love her and don't want her as a girlfriend. Because of her past I feel like an absolutely dick, that I don't said her this clearly, because she said me, that she definitely is looking for a long term relationships (she only had 3 really hurting short relationships).

We don't texting each other much, but on last Friday we had a date and ended up lying in her bed cuddling and kissing, we talked about Sex and decided to wait one or two dates. 

Yesterday our grade celebrated a huge party and Charlotte[17 f] was only there because of me. We want to keep our dating a secret so we kissed each other in the shadow of a backyard.

All this are enough problems. But it could not get worse. Sure I thought of Hanna[17 f], when I kissed Charlotte[17 f], I still love her, regardless, what she did to me. But it would have not been that bad, when she weren't on the party yesterday too. I don't talked one word to her, I thinked of going to her and asking her straight around, why she had did this to me. But I didn't. My wounds are now fresh as a half years ago and all these questions are back, I feel so sad, and worst of all I am probably hurting another girl really bad. When I kiss Charlotte[17 f] with closed eyes etc. it feels great I am somehow happy, but this is not last for long.

I am totally depressed right now and it hurts so bad, I had many crushes started like Hanna[17 f], but until her I never made approaches and now I feel like she is the only one I want and Charlotte[17 f] just somebody I use to, to practise. That is absolutely not fair to her, and I really don't want to do this, but every time I try to speak with her about this, I just change the topic or don't speak the truth.

I don't know what I should do to finally be ready with Hanna[17 f] and I don't know if I should tell Charlotte[17 f] the truth, break up with her, or start a relationship.

Please reddit help me, I don't know how to withstand this.

12085,Breakups,2sif9i,"I had posted on here a month or two ago, (under my usual user, not this throwaway) when things were going downhill rapidly, and had explained some of his behaviour recently.. The advice I got (and stupidly ignored) was to get out soon, that he was a nasty piece of work, and seemed extremely immature. Well, in the end, he dumped me over New Years, in bed, in his parents house, and now he won't move out of the house we shared (i pay the most rent), is acting like the injured party, and continues to try to hurt me in any way possible.

Long story (short-ish), we were together for a year and a half, and moved in together 6 months ago, coinciding with when he left his job to go back to college full time for a year. The first year was unbelieveable, your usual head-over-heels-perfect-together story. 

Things changed when he went back to college- he became even more anxious than he had previously been, he put me way down the priority list (i.e. broke dates, complained about being too broke to go out with me but went out with his friends about 3 nights a week), became extremely moody, and started to say extremely hurtful things in arguments. His ex girlfriend (they went out for 6 months about 7 years ago, but bad relationship/ break up/ etc) moved back to our city and he told me (no discussion) that he was going to meet her, and then insisted that I wasn't allowed to come because it would be 'weird' and it was a college friends thing (let me clarify that I am not a shit starter, and would have been sound). I told him how uncomfortable and insecure it made me, and promises were made that it was a once off. Flashforward 3 months and he tells me (again no discussion) that he was meeting her for coffee. When I told him I wasn't ok with it he just left. I went home to my parents for the weekend and he told me that he'd cancelled it. Flashforward again to just before christmas and an argument about our first date in two months that he cancelled because he stayed out drinking for 3 days with his new college friends (with two hours notice) and he text me saying actually I did meet her for coffee, I just didn't tell you to stop freaking the fuck out...fact. I should have ended it then but the usual happened, big argument, promises, and made up.

Christmas was amazing, he made the effort to come to my parents house and I went to his. It was just like old times. Then, I went to his house, and while his parents were out in the morning, we were in bed chatting, and I told him that I was still a little upset about the ex-thing, and I asked him never to lie to me again. He agreed, and I said that I knew I was insecure, and that I was going to work on it, and said I was thinking about going back to counselling,and there and then he broke up with me, saying it wasn't working and we shouldn't go out any more. So i got my things and left.

That was two weeks ago, and since then he is going out of his way to try and destroy my mental health. He can't afford the rent on our place, and told me in no uncertain terms that he wasn't getting stuck with the lease, so I offered to take it on and find a replacement roommate. I told him I wanted to be civilised, but he seems to think that this means all is well and we are now pals. Let me be clear, I am absolutely heart broken. Devastated. In pieces. I put so much into this relationship and he tossed me aside. We had an internet and tv subscription which I then cancelled, and he harassed me for an entire night get the password back, and said that I knew he needed it for college, and that I was trying to sabotage him, and that he couldn't believe I was doing this to him. Again, let me make it clear that he has unlimited 4G data on his iPhone, and has internet in college. Then he started saying that I was hindering him from leaving and that I was slowing down his house search. Again, all ridiculous.

Last night he sat across from me in the living room, called me a sad case for turning up the TV, and then when I asked him what he wanted from me, and why he was still trying to hurt me, he told me that I was the one hurting him with the WiFi and that his ex had been sound enough to help him out and get access actually.

I can't take much more of this. I am being so civilised, I could have fucked him out and changed the locks, but I am offering to take on the full responsibility of the lease. He's insisted that he's paid rent until the 2nd February, but once again, he did something and expected me to just be ok. If he didn't think about the consequences of dumping me, how am I the bad guy? And now he won't stop texting me about trivial things, when I begged him last night to leave me alone, and only tell me when he was leaving. I am in a complete mess, I have been dumped, and destroyed, and he won't stop coming after me and won't leave me alone.

12087,Relationships,2vcmuz,"I'm a single mother, two daughters, been divorced for about 8 years now.  Back in 2012, my girls spent the summer with their father and I saw an opportunity.  I've been married and/or pregnant since I was 19 and never really did the single life, so here was my chance.

I made a profile on a dating site and said clearly that I was looking for something casual.  I was up front and realistic about my kids and my current situation. Basically a little fun, maybe a hook up if things went well, no long term commitments.  Plenty of guys on the internet are interested in that and I went on a few dates.  Then, about a week before my girls came home, I met the guy I'll call R.

We clicked right away.  When I first saw his profile on the site, I actually said nah, out of my league, but then he messaged me.  He was funny, and smart, and attractive.  He is also divorced and has custody of his son, so he understood the whole single parent thing.  We started dating.  

There were a few indications early on that he was going to be clingy.  He got weird and pouty if I didn't text him back fast enough, or if he called and got my voicemail.  He wanted me to meet his family after a month, and his son on our third date.  I was willing to overlook these things though, because in my head, we were having fun.  It was casual fun and I enjoyed my time with him and if he's a little weird sometimes, whatever, I'm not marrying the guy.  We had great conversations and great dates and great sex.  That was enough for me.

Then, 5 months after we'd met, I got a job offer that involved moving across the country.  It meant better money, better opportunities, and the chance to get out of that crappy, high crime, high poverty, poor quality schools, town I was living in.  I said yes in a second.  Didn't even think about R.  

I told him about the job and the move that night.  He processed for about 30 seconds, and then immediately said he'd move with me.  I told him I wasn't asking him to do that, I wasn't asking him to uproot his life and his son and move away from his family just to keep dating me.  He insisted that he wanted to. 

That was all two years ago.  We've been in a long distance relationship ever since.  He's been unable to move because his custody agreement has a geographic restriction that says he can't leave the county he and his ex both live in if he wants his son to keep living with him.  He got a lawyer and has been going to court, re-working the agreement, which has turned into a fresh custody battle.  It's constant drama with his ex, who is genuinely crazycakes.

He's come up to visit several times, and every time, he's stayed with me.  Usually just for a couple weeks, once for a month.  Weirdly, being long distance has actually made our relationship stronger.  I've stopped thinking of him as casual fun.  Maybe the degree of commitment he's shown to moving for me has made me realize how seriously he takes us and how he wants it to be long term.  And he is truly a good man.  He's everything my ex wasn't.  He's a terrific father, to his son and he's great with my girls as well.  His son is the sweetest little boy you'll ever meet.  R is patient and honest and kind, and isn't afraid to admit when he's wrong and apologize.  When he's here, I feel like I'm a better parent because I have a partner and don't have to do everything alone.  

His court battle is winding up, and he's winning.  In a few months, he'll be ready to make the move.  Bottom line, he expects to live with me, and I've already said yes.  It would be wrong of me to back out now, especially after all the work and effort he's put in.

I've told him I love him, which I believe is true, but it's something I have a hard time with.  I love my children, completely and totally, but I haven't been able to feel that for anyone else for a long time.  My dad cheated on my mom and eventually left her for a woman half his age; she had no education or work experience or credit and wound up selling the house and moving into a trailer park. (He's on wife #4 now, by the way.)  Then my ex did basically the same thing to me, except at least I had a degree and a job, because I wasn't about to let myself depend on him and get screwed over like my mom.  Now I'm with R, and while I trust that he's not cheating, I have a hard time letting him in.  I can't shake the idea that once he's here full time, once I actually let myself rely on him, he's going to cut and run.  Because in my head, that's what men do.  That's not fair and it's not accurate but what I know rationally and what I feel don't always line up.   

Bottom line--am I being stupid by hesitating to commit to this awesome guy?  Or is this moving too fast?

He said he fell in love with me the second he saw me.Our relationship was great we were always together, we've been on a bunch of trips together, we knew all of our families, we had the most amazing relationship, but of course we had our arguments every once in a while. About a month ago he told me that he was kind of bored and felt like he was loosing feelings, we talked about it and said we were gonna try and fix it and we did. He said that he hasn't been feeling like that anymore and that we were perfectly fine. Just a couple days ago he was telling me that he already knows how he wants to propose to me and that he's so blessed to have me, that he can't wait to graduate and go on trips together and that we're going to get married. Then a couple days after he said I'm sorry I can't do this any more that he lost feelings and doesn't feel happy. But I admit that the last couple days of our relationship I was being a bitch to him. We were both stressed due to school and I wasn't treating him like he should be. We're still friends but I've begged him to give me another chance that I won't treat him wrong and that we can be happy but he refuses he says no and that he just wants to be alone for the rest of school, I love this man with all my heart, and I know he's the man without a doubt that I want to spend the rest of my life with, everything about him I'm completely and utterly in love with. Idk what to do anymore, if I should keep trying to get him or give him space and see if maybe in the future, idk I can feel it in my heart that if he gives me another chance we can be happy and I will never make the mistake of treating him badly, please help me he was the only person I had and I'm so lost with out him words can even begin to explain how much I love that man.

The thing is that he wants $100/month. And when I say wants, I mean he really wants it. I managed to cool him down today, but he brought this up with me earlier today and was pretty intense about his belief that he deserves $100/month because it's the fair value of his commute. He insisted he wasn't trying to rip me off, but it's what I owe him if I want to be fair.

This seems way too high to me for such a short commute. In fact, I even convinced him that if I owe him gas money, then conversely he would owe me gas money if we had lived in his favored apartment (which is close to where he works). He agreed that it is therefore fair that I would only pay up to the half-way point for his commute. That means his commute is effectively a mere 2.5 miles one way or 5 miles a day.

Now, he also gets every other Friday off. So he only actually commutes something like 20 days a month. That's a total of 100 miles a month that I'd owe him for. If his car only gets 20 miles/gallon (he drives a Mazda3, so it probably gets more) and if gas is $3.50 (which is very realistic here; in fact, it might be less than that on average), that's only $17.5/month. He wants over five times that much. Even if I paid for his entire commute, which he agreed wouldn't make sense, that'd be only $35, still significantly less than $100.

Am I being unreasonable here? I think giving him any more than $20/month would be ridiculous. I'm also offended that he views this as a sort of business transaction and not a favor from me to him. If I do this, it's a gift as far as I'm concerned, a gift I'm not obligated to give. So it upsets me that he'd not only demand what seems to me like five times the actual amount I owe him, but he wouldn't even appear remotely grateful that I would even consider paying for his gas.

11450,Non-Romantic,3furf4,"So some backstory.
3 years ago my relationship with my sons father dissolved and I was forced to move back in with my mother, I had lived away from the age of 15. I was there for 6 months and left and moved 30 miles away, and really turned my life around (went back to college, got my son into a better school, found a great partner, got a great job etc..) so life has been great. 
My sister has always been a bit of a liability although she's older than I am she's never really got out from underneath my mother's apron let's call her S. so S had her first child 6 years ago, she suffered from post natal depression and neglected her first son. Somehow even though I have another older sister and brother I ended up looking after her son while she sorted herself out, because baby daddyleft. Fast forward 4 years later, she pops out another baby with a guy she's know for all of 5 minutes. Again baby daddy buggers off.
I had already moved away, but my mother pressured me to be with her, I took time off work stayed with her through labour and came home with her for a week. Then this month, baby daddy no 3 walks out 2 days before her twins are due to be born.
So I stayed with her through labour which was 36 hours, during this time I didn't sleep and it messed up my body clock.

It's now the summer hoidays and my son has gone to his dad's for a week, and I reveled on facebook that I could finally have a Lie in and chill out because I have time off work. Cue my mother shaming me on facebook to go and help my sister.

I'm writing this as my sister lies in bed, I've been here for 3 days. I have looked after all 4 of her children while she has done nothing. And due to the body clock mess up I haven't slept, I think I've had 5 hours in the last 3 days. 

I told my boyfriend I'd be coming home because It's her eldest son's birthday and she hasn't bothered to get out of bed. She didn't want help she wanted a slave. He told me she's probably exhausted and so on. My mother has told me  should do something for the family for once

In reference to the fact I left town.
The reason I left is because I heard her tell my brother she planned on kicking me out and letting S move back in...

S has had her issues. And I have done so much to help her, I have her eldest son at my house to stay the night almost every weekend. I am at breaking point.

I want to go home, but I don't want my family and boyfriend to turn on me. Part of me just thinks when I had issues with my son's father I was left to sort it out but S never has to face up to anything.

11453,Non-Romantic,36ks51,"My dad divorced my mum a couple years ago to see his current girlfriend. We were a pretty happy family, so it was a bit of a shock and a financial mess, and most of us left much poorer and with some deep emotional trouble/mental illness diagnoses. During this time, my sister - who has a history of anxiety - wound up picking fights with everyone, screaming personal attacks over things like gas in the family car. My brother and I haven't talked to her in almost 3 years. In the past couple months she has only started replying to my mum's emails.

She attacked our dad plenty of times, too, but he's very much an enabler and *heavily* favourites his daughters (which makes me feel awful for my brother, but that's another mess...). However, his gf considers herself something of a really good therapist &amp; mediator and has spent years trying to help my sister; calling her out on bad behaviour, giving advice, etc. Her and my dad have basically become a team and think it's their mission to rehabilitate us kids into having a relationship again.

For instance, they managed to convince my sister to attend a bunch of gatherings while my brother and I were there (dad's birthday, Christmas, etc.). She wouldn't say anything to us, wouldn't make eye-contact, just pretended we didn't exist. (Keep in mind, we stopped talking because of attacks she made on us; we never retaliated or insulted her. She has no reason to be pissed at us.)

Thing is, I've been quite happy without my sister around. I was a nerd growing up and she was popular and prettier. She often made it obvious how uncool she thought I was, she bad-mouthed me to her friends, and she was only ever sisterly to me when she wanted something or needed help persuading our parents to buy her something. I don't miss her presence at all.

Even though dad and the gf are also fed up with her awful behaviour, they still think it's partly my and my brother's responsibility to fix this. They mention her in conversation, try and 'counsel' us, ask if we're close to forgiving her yet. I've made clear that I won't attend any more events where she's invited and will ignore/stink-eye us all evening, but they're still trying.

She's 25. She stomps up stairs when she's angry, she storms away when confronted, borrows stuff without asking, is incredibly judgmental and talks behind peoples backs, and cannot take an ounce of criticism. She was mad at the gf for a day when she said she didn't like Frozen (Disney fanatic). She's still mentally 10 years old.

I don't *want* a relationship with her. She did a miserable job as a sister. If she matures and apologizes, I'm open to trying. But dad and his gf won't let it go. (FUCK that Frozen pun was unintentional.)

What can I do about this, if anything? I want my dad and his gf to stop talking about her to me, to drop the insistence on forgiveness, to stop thinking they have 'work' to do on me. But I can't say that, can I? Am I wrong to ask that, when they just want us to be a family again? How do I get them to understand that I want boundaries on this?
   
**tl;dr**: Family divorce, sister is an immature hoser, am I entitled to get my dad and his gf off my back about reconnecting?

edit: I just thought I should add. Her judgmental attitude is also the reason I hated myself a lot in high school and am still a closeted gay. I'm still terrified of what she would think of me. So.

11481,Non-Romantic,2t7i97,"I'll preface by giving a little background info. My mother for most of my life was emotionally and physically abusive. She was also on drugs and an alcoholic. She is still an alcoholic but she doesn't drink as often. Claims she is clean from drugs (bullcrap). My father died when I was a baby, she re-married a few years later to my sisters father. They divorced a few years later. Last year she re-married a new man, he's a great guy. 

She does a lot for me, and even though sometimes I hate her, I still love her. She's the only mother I have. I also don't want to stop contact with her because that would upset my grandparents. My grandparents are wonderful people who enable my mother but I don't want them to hurt over my mother either. They love her, she is their only child. Despite all her issues they wouldn't drop her. And I love them too much to cause a rift between her and I and put them in the middle. Which she absolutely would do. 

So, my husband left for a month for work. He traveled a few states away. My step father (I like him a lot, that's what I'll call him) is working with my husband also. So they traveled together. He confided in my husband a few things regarding their marriage. Not long ago she went to her ex's home. She withdrew money from their account and spent it on drugs and alcohol. She likely cheated, that's what she does and always has. He also caught a man going out of their home. My husband told me this because well, it's my mother. I've dealt with her behavior for quite a long time. 

I will also admit I am pretty selfish, she doesn't drink or act crazily around my children (we have 3). She doesn't want them to see grandma this way, but she wont quit on her free time. She claims she is 100% clean. She isn't, just last year her best friend (whom I call my aunt) caught her doing drugs in her home. My aunt has no reason to lie about this to me. In the way that I am selfish, she will do things for me. Watch my children for an hour with her husband (I wouldn't let her do it alone). She'll clean for me. She will give my children little gifts. And they love her, they don't know the bad side of her. I don't want to change that much either as we have very limited amount of family. After my fathers death, his family wanted nothing to do with me. My mothers fault on that as well. My mother-in-law is amazing, but she lives far away. My father-in-law lives 20 minutes from us but couldn't care less. So it's mostly my mother, my grandparents, and my mother in law that are around. 

I want to send her husband a message, talk to him about what he told my husband. Tell him he can talk to me about her, but he confided in my husband and my husband said he doesn't want me to possibly damage that trust he formed. I just feel like he doesn't have anyone to talk to about her problems, and my husband isn't fully aware of her, who she is. 

I also want to completely cut her out of my life, but I don't want to hinder the relationship my children have with her. I don't want to harm my grandparents. And if they stay married, I'd like to keep him in our lives. He's choosing currently to stay with her.

The main issue is that if she is upset about something she makes everyone else's lives miserable. 

My mom is the type of person who has trouble getting along with others...She has a history of having close relationships and then all of a sudden hating someone, this happened a lot during my childhood. Every job she had also she would find people to hate there and always claim that they were trying to sabotage her, etc.

She is very selfish and rude, no one understands what she is going through but the truth is she's got it pretty good. It kills me because sometimes she can be so nice, caring and thoughtful...it really is a jekyll/hyde situation.

My poor dad is caught in the middle. He is super sensitive and never, ever stands up to her. She treats him like a doormat. Constantly interrupts him, berates him, etc. And he still will do anything to pacify her. Every time they visit, he talks less and less and I believe it's because he just knows she will interrupt him or talk for him anyway so why bother.

This has really blown up since we had the baby. My mom wants to tell us what to do and what not to do, and has been very rude and not understanding. A newborn is a huge adjustment and we've had no support from her. She hasn't even asked me how I am doing, not once. When she comes over she is snippy to us and just wants photo ops with the baby. My in laws came to help us and my mom said they were spoiling us and that no one helped her when she had me. She gives us hell about using a pacifier, how I dress the baby, how we are raising him, etc Oh and that I was breastfeeding him wrong (she formula fed me!)

She constantly picks on us for stupid things, like how warm or cold we keep our house, or how many hobbies we have, etc. I have never asked her for money or to pay my bills so I am not sure why this even matters, but she will find some way to make a snide comment about our HVAC (72 in winter 68 in summer..oh the horror).

In short she's miserable to be around. She wanted to come over on Christmas (I was a week post partum, very tired and not adjusted yet) I said it was fine. The first thing she said when she walked in the door was, wow...you look like ___ she didn't complete the sentence but the word was shit. I was so tired...I had slept like 10 hours since the baby came. While I was upstairs feeding him she was rudely commenting about how long it was taking (he's a baby FFS). We all tried having a discussion about The Interview (movie) and she interjected with some stupid comments about how they were trying to save lives by not showing it in movie theatres...basically shutting the conversation down. it's things like this constantly with her. 

She complained about the traffic getting to us...she's the one who decided to live on that side of town and for someone who doesn't work and only has to go through said traffic once or twice a week, it's ridiculous. Meanwhile my in laws hop in a car for three hours to come see us and don't even mention it.

Her general behavior at holidays is rude. Always the first person to rush to get food and sit down, and starts eating before we are all seated. Always takes heaps of left overs. At this Christmas, was slamming dishes and chairs because it wasn't going her way (I'm guessing bc I was tired and not talkative?). 

She came back a few days after Christmas, held the baby and basically ignored me the whole time to talk to my MIL. She finally asked me how she was doing...and the way she said it was so sarcastic, like someone had a gun to her head. The visit was awkward and strained (even my IL's commented) and when she left she pretty much bolted and didn't even hug me goodbye or anything.

This is just a small taste of what she does but I won't bore you with the rest. The truth is we have all been putting up with it too long (I tried ignoring the behavior but it doesn't work) and she needs to be confronted.

I talked to my dad about it and his immediate response was to put his head in the sand and ignore it. Always the peacekeeper he was begging me not to start something. A week later he finally agrees we need to talk. I happily offered to pay for therapy but I know my mom is above it and will not agree.

I told my dad to tell me the next time they want to come over, and I plan to call her and tell her we need to talk when she gets here. That way she doesn't feel ambushed.

I need some advice though on how to broach these topics without making her feel ganged up on, or that we are dumping it all on her (whether or not she deserves it). I do want my husband to be there for support and because he is really fed up with as well. I feel my dad should be there also as she treats him like shit.

How does one positively handle such a sensitive person? I have a feeling it's just going to turn into a, woe is me my whole family hates me playing the victim game like she usually does. I genuinely want to fix this...I don't want her to miss out on these important early days of her grandson's life.

I haven't posted here before and please let me know if there's a better subreddit for this.



I'll try to give as unbiased and accurate view of events as possible, which I know can be hard when you're feeling a little emotional.
So, a little background first. I'm in my last year of high school, living with my parents and grandma. My brother lives in his own place (23 y/o) and stopped by for two days to celebrate Christmas with us. Things have always been very tense when he comes to visit, though usually between him and my mom. They don't get along well and inevitably get in huge fights whenever he visits (I can barely remember how they lived together!). But usually the two of us get along okay, so what happened today was a huge shock.



The fist fight this morning wasn't much of a fight really, though I'll get to that. It started when he came over - from the very beginning he seemed very tense, angry, and generally grumpy. I think he is facing some stress from his job, but he also generally as an abrasive personality. We were talking about something pretty trivial and irrelevant and the breakfast table, and were both holding strong stances on the topic. Okay, no big deal, we debate sometimes. He was actually in MUN while in highschool or something and loves to argue.



Breakfast ended and I got up, accidentally bumping his chair when I was trying to squeeze by. Before I could even say sorry, he slammed his chair backwards and me into the wall with it. I said what the hell was that for? and he jumped out of his chair and began yelling at me with violence and fury in his eyes that took me totally offguard. Seriously, my fingers are shaking typing this, I don't know why he got so upset. He began yelling things like I'll beat your ass! and cussing me out. I really tried to remain calm, saying what are you doing? what is this for but was losing patience pretty fast.



Not as fast as my dad though, who apparently had had enough of his shit. (Mild verbal abuse had been on and off the whole day, though I can take some blame for this, I probably could have been nicer and more cooperative with him.) My dad got up and was even more angry than me, demanding that he leave the house and not talk to his brother like that, saying stuff like Who do you think you are? You think you can behave however you want? He really would have thrown him out of the house, literally if necessary, if my mom and grandma hadn't intervened and broken things up.
We both went to our separate sides of the house after that, my mom dragging him to her bedroom to talk to him and me going up to my room to avoid escalation and try to calm down.



Sorry, I know this is getting long so I'll cut to the chase. He came upstairs to get something he left in my room, and as he was walking down he couldn't resist some disparaging and condescending remark. He was already at the foot of the stairs and I was at the top, and too tired to argue I just replied Fuck you.



Well that really set him off, and he started charging up the stairs despite my mom's shouts. As he walked up them I said Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't do this. but didn't move. When he reached me (which didn't take long, the stairs are pretty short), he grabbed my arms. I don't know what he was going to do next, but I had had enough and punched him in the face. It is the first time I have ever punched someone. And it was my brother. On Christmas.



There wasn't any fight after that, he went downstairs to call the police and report assault. My dad was actually also really upset by what he did and I think during our scuffle he tried to hit my brother too, then got even more upset when he went to call the police and grabbed the phone out of his hands. (They still got called though). Nothing happened with that, the police came, tried to calm us down, and didn't take any names or charge us with anything. I don't really know what he expected, as I felt I was defending myself and he was the aggressor.



He left pretty quickly after that, and now everyone else in the family is sitting in their own rooms, including me. I don't know what I expect from you guys, but I do feel bad about what I did and don't know how to make things up with my brother. What's even worse is that I don't know if I WANT to make things up with my brother. I just want to talk a bit and think about it, whatever you say is appreciated, even if it's that I'm a stupid asshole.

He's our first cat since my dad got divorced over 10 years ago so it was a big deal that my dad let a cat in the house. Tuna just turned 6 this May, he's been my dad's best buddy through a lot, including me moving out on my own.

Lately he hasn't been eating much and when my parents went away he stopped eating altogether.  His symptoms pointed to diabetes and since my SO is diabetic I could easily test him with his one-touch.  His BG was 45 (normal is 80-120) so off to the vet we went.  I talked to my dad, told him Tuna wasn't eating, had low blood sugar, and my vet tech friend would run his bloodwork to get an official diagnosis.

It wasn't what we thought.  She called me and told me they were going to run a test with his urine but when they were feeling for his bladder they felt a mass in his stomach.  They ran an x-ray and she said it wasn't good... She called later after the ultrasound and it's cancer.

When I talked to my dad that night I just told him they pulled blood and had to send it out for results.  He won't be back until Monday.  He sounds so happy and he's having such a good time, I can't do that to them. Thing is, when they come back, what do I say? This doesn't happen to kids, it's something parents have to do but now I have to tell them that he only has a week to a couple months to live.  The way he's not eating, he might have until next week but I can't let him just starve to death.

I am a female in my 20's, and have been living in a two-bedroom apartment with 2 other roommates for 8 months now. The apartment is certainly not spacious,  and because there is three of us occupying two rooms, I sleep in a shared room with one of my roommates. 

They are both great guys, around the same age as me, with many shared interests. We get along pretty well. The two are quite different, though. My first roommate (I'll call him Steve) is a very tidy,  responsible individual.  He spends countless hours studying (he's pre-med)   and is somewhat rarely seen--it's either the library, or he's in his room (he's the one with his own room.) When he's home, though, he always picks up after himself and leaves nothing in the living room. 

 The other roommate, (I'll call him Brent) is just fine as friend, but he's not at all like the former. Brent is always home, his favorite spot being on the couch. Behind him is a wake of mess-- he leaves his unfinished food on the counter or sofa for days if there's no intervention. His dishes can be found in the sink or stovetop, his clothes and shoes in the living room. Very rarely  he will perform some small task, such as clean a few pans. 

Steve and I are the only ones who actually clean, and it's a majority of Brent's stuff that we're putting away or washing. Ill admit that some days a bit of the mess is mine,  but I don't let it stay. 

 I have occasionally talked to him about it, but it's met with excuses, blame-shifting, or him electing to help although he never does. Steve gets annoyed too but has lower standars than me, thus has no ambition to try and change it. 

How can I break this cycle? I have tried just not cleaning anymore,  but all that happens is our place becomes a dump. I can't stand it, so I eventually clean.

Hey everyone, this may not be the best place but I don't know how to approach the situation.

Tonight while on the couch I saw the little boy who lives next door abusing his new puppy. By abuse, I don't mean kicking or punching. He was telling the puppy to go to the bathroom and when he didnt, he pulled the puppy by his leg up the hill and stopped, tried 2 legs, and then gave up and picked him up. Then, he shook him violently as he brought him in, scolding the puppy.

I realize it's not your textbook abuse, it's not something I guess you'd call the ASPCA over, but I really feel like his parents should know how he is treating the dog to prevent it from happening again or from escalating.

However, we've only been moved in for a few weeks. We don't want to start anything with the neighbors and don't want any problems. How can we/should we approach his parents about this issue? I understand if it's overstepping our bounds but I'd like some outside advice.

So not to be too much of a cliche but I fell in love with a girl from the moment I met her and it just deepened more as I got to know her. I thought we hit it off and eventually we became really close and she called me a friend. Oblivious to the obvious signs that she wasn't interested in me
 I didn't say anything for about a year and then she told me she had feelings for my best friend.
 I was devastated and soon after I asked her out and she declined saying that she wished to just remain friends, like a brother and her closest friend to her. She then dated my best friend for a few months and they eventually broke up. I was there for hger as a friend and then eventually I asked her out again and low and behold she ended up declining again and dating another one of my friends.
 At the same time I was going through a rough stage with everything, suffering abuse at school and from my stepdad and mum and she was there for me through it all.
 I thought I was over her until eventually she broke up with him and I asked her out yet again, she declined with the same response and telling me she needed me as her friend and that we need each other. I was so mad I told her to fuck off and fuck off she did.
 She ignored me for a month until we eventually resolved it. Soon after I left home and I am currently supporting myself with the help from her and her family, she helps me with washing, rent, etc and is there for me emotionally and I basically have noo-ne else in my life to depend on apart from her.
 I thought I was over those feelings until now 7 months later and she is currently in a relationship of 6 months.

11592,Non-Romantic,1rzn2z,"So, I'm an American. My wife is a German. We moved to Berlin about two months ago and I'm now in full, crazy contact with her in-laws and it's weirding me out. I had met all of these people previously on trips to Europe, but I'm now realizing that I've become a central puzzle piece in this broken family. Let me break down the family tree because it's complicated:

-Wife's adopted father (AF) is here in Berlin.

-Wife's real father (RF) is in Prague, Czech Republic

-Wife's step-mother (SM) lives on the border of France on the other side of Germany, is still with AF but only spends every other weekend in Berlin.

-Wife's real mother (RM) lives on the other side of Germany, but is absolutely smitten with our 4 year-old daughter.

-RM's boyfriend (RMB) lives with RM.

-Wife's sister (S) lives in Berlin also.

So, AF is a recovering alcoholic but he's not recovering well. I was never well-informed as to the extent of his alcoholism or its affects on him. We had a Thanksgiving dinner last week and he was asking me to sneak him beers--which I did and it was a huge mistake, clearly. I was just trying to get in good with my father-in-law. Wife and sister were pretty upset about it--not at me, because I didn't really know. I won't be doing that again. 

Other than that, he's a nice guy--not really my style of person. But I like him overall and would like to have a nice relationship with him. I certainly don't want to be the beer police. 

RM just left our apartment after having a huge fight with my wife to spontaneously make the 6 hour drive across Germany. She's seriously a bitch. She criticizes everything my wife says or does. She criticizes me, thinking I don't understand her--but I do. And the bulk of her rage is directed at her boyfriend who is a genuinely sweet, longsuffering man. She always has something nasty to say and seem to actively seek out any and every detail of every situation that she can harp on about.

My wife is clearly upset. RM was going to come for Christmas, but was threatening to cancel the flight in hopes of manipulating some sympathetic response from us. My wife walked out, leaving me to handle it. I said, Come if you want, don't come if you want. I don't care. She then said she wasn't coming to which I shrugged my shoulders and told her to drive safely. 

My wife thinks I'm some sort of hero for the way I handled it, but I fear that this story is far from over. 

My German isn't great. I'm trying to adapt to a new culture. I'm trying to do good work and raise my daughter right. My wife and I have our own problems. My family consists of my parents who have been married for over 30 years. I don't really understand this broken family stuff. I don't like drama and I don't want to play head games with a 60 year-old, bitter woman and her damaged daughter. 

Does anyone have any advice on the nightmare mother-in-law situation? Is there any way I can avoid just checking out while still maintaining a safe distance from the drama?

Im usually a lurker of this sub-reddit but I believe I need the sage advice of all those who post and reply here. First off let me put some background to better understand my position as well as hers. 
(Names and Places changed for anonymity) I first met Nancy when I was 15, I was living in a foregin country because of my parents work. She had just arrived after spending a majority of her childhood outside of the country to spend her highschool/college days in her home country. The country was and has declined as a 2nd world country since its independence and much of its infrastructure and customs are highly unchanged with its ever changing diplomatic system.

I was the first person she talked to at the school on her first day, we had art together and I was her partner, she loved art and I felt indifferent so we naturally became best friends. A fact to note about international schools is the unfortunate bi-product that the kids who attend them usually cycle in and out every 3 years or so. Whether it be because of expats/diplomats/goverment officials/ buisness etc. **We are what you would call 3rd culture kids.**

It was always in the back of your mind that your best friends and class mates could be gone the next year, I left a year before Nancys senior year back to my home country where I experienced my first depression that spanned about 2 and a half years with multiple suicide attempts and police visits to my house. Leaving Nancy behind as well as another group of friends gets harder the more times you do it, up to that point id moved to different countries twice. I didnt handle it properly, I didnt ask for help, I wallowed with myself and luckily I survived with my life. 

During that time, Nancy was realizing her dream. She's an artist and always wanted to go to university and study art. She spent her time at our old school getting any and all awards or certifications that pertained to art, she completed her IB diploma and graduated with honours. She would go on to realize her dream she got into her dream university in her dream city and had completed her first year there when she happened to pass out at her apartment complex, something was wrong with her heart (I would pin the problem on her smoking habit). This medical issue caused her to leave university and return to her home country to recover around family. 

This is when we started talking more frequently again, I had been preoccupied with my mental health and she had been busy reaching her dream. This was a few months ago and I was able to get her to go back to the same University to do what she wants to do, everything seemed to be going alright because the first time she left I thought it was due to her home sickness. Unfortunately I now know that shes in a major depression where shes unable to get out bed, unable to enjoy her art, all around stagnant mindset where all she has is grief and fear. Shes stopped going to University, and is contemplating returning home where I think the level of help she would be able to get it absolutely zero. Her family isnt the wealthiest and money has always been a factor in all of her decisions, this is the last time she'll be able to do this, her guilt for them already paying for her tuition is what I believe triggers a lot of her feelings. 

I have been talking to her the last couple of days non-stop allowing her to get her feelings out and do really figure out her state of mind. I do not believe she will hurt herself but I am open to the fact that it doesnt matter at this point. I've told her to find help in the country shes going to university at. So far she hasn't contacted anyone and she is afraid and scared to do so, I've told her the difference in care between her home country and where she is currently but that doesn't seem to sway her into taking action. 

**tl;dr** **: My bestfriend is extremely depressed to the point of being bed ridden and unable to function in University. She is scared to seek help despite my behest. She threatens to leave and return to her home country, which she has already done once, and to never return to University.**

**&gt;**I believe that going to university and being treated can be done at the same time but is there anything that should be done in terms of that?

I know this is a bit out there compared to the other posts in this sub, but it's happening in a few hours and I need advice on how to keep my cool.


First, the relationship. We're madly in love. We've been putting up with long distance for three years. We spend months apart, but hours on Skype. We've dated for six years, and this Thanksgiving I popped the question.


Now, she's a first generation Indian-American. Malayam was her first language, and her parent's are from Kerala India. They're also extremely religious. Her grandfather was a priest, her little brother was just ordained as a deacon, and they see EVERY action as coming from God or Satan. I'm almost positive that I fall in the latter category.


Two years ago they found out about us when my fiance ran away from home to live with me (they were setting up an arranged marriage for her). After cutting her off financially (something we knew would happen) they begged her to still come with them to India on a family trip. She went, and they had her exorcised. 


They know we got engaged, but they don't understand it. They've just been praying that I'll go away. So I'm going to see them all today to try explaining it. We've met a few times before, and even though I've tried to talk with them they usually don't say anything back.


In recent weeks they've been crying a lot, and going to four hour masses each day. They are upset that they haven't been involved in our decision to marry, despite the fact that they never talk with me.


As said in the beginning: I'm going to see them today. I'm determined to be polite and rational, but they absolutely refuse to see anything from anyone else's perspective.

I have a very close male friend, J.  He and I have known each other for 8 years, we tell each other everything, he's like a big brother to me, all that jazz.  And while there's nothing romantic between us, I do care about him and his well-being.

J dated this girl, D, for about 3.5 years.  They were long distance (as in opposite sides of an ocean long distance) for the last 8 months or so.  The relationship was never that awesome.  The whole thing started with J dumping another girl to be with D, they had broken up and gotten back together at one point, J sort of cheated on her (he said she knew about it and didn't care), D was very manipulative and whiny, and by J's own admission he wasn't the nicest or most caring of boyfriends towards her.  D broke up with J via Skype last summer, mainly because she wanted to get married and he didn't.  They sort of mutually cut off all contact.

At first J seemed fine, but after about a month he made the mistake of Facebook stalking D and seeing that she had gotten a new boyfriend, started going by a new nickname, and basically seemed like a happier person without him.  He took that hard.

After a few months of non-contact - during which time I thought he had actually gotten better as he had seemed happier and had been dating around - he all of a sudden breaks down and tells me that he is miserable and wants her back and asks for my advice to get her back.  I told him that was a TERRIBLE idea; she's moved on, she has a new boyfriend, what's your freaking plan here?  He legitimately wanted to show up at her house (on the other side of an ocean), hope her new boyfriend wasn't there, and pretty much propose on the doorstep (since not wanting to get married is why she broke it off, he thinks proposing will fix it).  I was floored by the stupidity of this plan and managed to talk him out of it.  I told him he'd be better off to keep to no contact, but he sent her an e-mail anyway.  She sent him an e-mail back that - in the nicest way possible - told him that she had moved on and that speaking to him was awkward and she didn't want to continue; so basically leave me alone and have a nice life.  That was in November.

*I should point out at this point that J quite literally sends me the e-mails that D sends him, so I'm not just guessing at what she's saying to him, I've actually read it.*

About six weeks later, D sent J an unsolicited e-mail.  She said that the only reason she said she didn't want to talk to him anymore is because her new boyfriend told her to say that, and that she had broken up with this new boyfriend.  She said that she was going through a difficult time in her life, and that she wanted to work on herself and not rely on any men for anything.  I.e. I want to be single for a while.

Now, for some reason, J seems to think that D is lying.  That basically this is some reverse psychology and what she really wants is for him to beg for her back.  He says that he is going to play it by ear and not ask her out again yet, but they break non-contact.  Over the next month or so they talk on the phone a couple times, refriend each other on Facebook, etc.

Last weekend, J called D.  He noticed that she was acting really annoyed at him, and finally she said, Why are you calling me?  He broke down and told her that he misses her and wants to see her.  She said there was no way logistically for them to be together, that a friendship would be awkward, and that if/when she starts dating again she is going to go non-contact again.  After they got off the phone, D sent him an e-mail that said she was sorry if she gave him false hope that they could be together, and that she didn't feel that she could be his girlfriend again.  It was very polite, and I give her credit for trying to spare his feelings.

Here's where things start to get crazy.  J sent me that e-mail, and right beneath that he said he was considering offering to pay for her to come visit him.  My jaw just about hit the floor.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME, J?  She openly admits that she can never be your girlfriend again, and apologizes if she gave you hope that she could, and you ignore it completely and want to pay for her plane ticket?  Really?  He still thinks this is all just a game, that she's just messing with him and trying to make him beg.

So I picked the e-mail apart, pulling out quotes and analyzing them for his benefit, trying to explain that this doesn't look like a game to me, this looks like a really nice Dear John letter.  Before he can respond to me or her on the subject, D e-mails him AGAIN.  This time she said basically, you were a really bad boyfriend and I can't go through that again, etc.  She also made a point to mention that there was a window of opportunity for him to get her back, and that he completely missed that window.

J STILL THINKS THIS IS A GAME.  He said it's pretty transparent what she's trying to do.  I'm like, yeah, it's transparent that she wants you to stop contacting her!  I've never seen someone so in denial.  I told him that even IF this is a game - and I'm pretty sure it's not - these are not the kinds of games to play with a person's heart.  Even if D actually wants J back, this is a completely unhealthy relationship waiting to happen.

I have advised J at this point to go non-contact again and LET HER GO, but he is very stubborn.  He sometimes doesn't act like himself where D is concerned, and I don't think he's going to take my advice.  If he talks to her again, one of two things will happen.  Either I'm right - she wants him to go away - and he gets his heart broken all over again.  Or he's right - she's just messing with him to get him back - and they get back into a toxic relationship.  Neither of these outcomes is in J's best interest, and that is what I care about:  J's happiness.

Is there *anything* that I could do or say to convince him to drop it?  I have watched him get his heart broken over this girl once and I don't want to see it again.  I feel like D has done her part in trying to end things, and I just don't know what to do to make J see that.  He's my closest friend and I want him to be happy, so how can I stop something from happening that I know will hurt him?

11630,Non-Romantic,1oclwr,"SO, this is not your typical post.  However, my best friend has maintained a long distance relationship with her boyfriend while he was overseas for about six months. She has been super excited for him to come home, and knows it's happening soon because he's been dropping hints to her, but has no idea when. 

Her partner and I plan to surprise her, but we are unsure of how to go about doing it! He will be flying into an airport from a bigger city, so he will have someone else picking him up from the airport to bring him home.  Beyond that, we haven't gotten far with ideas as we only started thinking this up tonight.  If anyone could suggest ways to surprise her it would be greatly appreciated! She's a beautiful person and deserves something nice :)

If there's a more appropriate board for me to post this in, please let me know! Thanks

In this group of characters, the person I am having issues with is Jasmine. She's usually very laid back and mature, which is why this perplexes me.

I've known this group of 4 friends for 6 months. We hang out at least 2 times a week every week. However, these last couple weeks Emma and I, have been traveling and the group has hung out less. When another friend, Leeroy, posted on Facebook about how he was free but the group was gone, Jasmine posted Excuse me. Jack and I are still in town! Being drunk at the time, I posted what I thought was a funny comment saying yeah but you guys are boring! I realized it wasn't funny but mean so I deleted it. Apparently she saw it. Both the message and the delete. Oops.

Over our groups Facebook chat she told me to EFF YOUR FACE, Dennis! Since this is something we regularly say to each other, I thought she was joking so I responded in kind. It went back and forth in the group for a bit between the 5 of us. She went silent for a day and then today she left the group. So I think I hurt her feelings more than she let on. 

I sent her a message asking why did you leave the group? She hasn't responded. I'm inclined to leave it at that until I come back home in a day. I don't want to assume what her problem is and try to apologize for what may not even be the crux of the problem. I talked to Emma about it and she's not being very helpful with what the issue is -_-. What should I do? I'm planning to ask her if she wants to talk when I'm back in the states.

11638,Non-Romantic,3cccux,"We spent a large part of the holiday weekend with another family, including many hours yesterday at a beach. Wife and I have 2 kids (9m, 6f), other couple has 3 (9f, 8f, 6m). Kids played together the entire day while us Adults chatted.  was nothing out of the ordinary about the day at all.  These are casual friends of ours, not close friends (my wife and the mom are very friendly, I/we hardly know the husband). We happened to run In to them at a campsite on Saturday, this was not a planned trip together. 

We all left the beach around 3pm to drive the hour or so back to our houses in the same neighborhood. Our cars separated immediately upon leaving the beach, as we had a trailer and were driving much slower. 

When my family and I were about 15 minutes away from home, we turned down a road, and the wife of the family we were just with was sitting by herself on the side of the road with just her cell phone. I immediately pulled over and my wife got out to talk to her.

Her story was that she had fallen asleep during the ride, and was woken up near where we found her by her husband hitting her, telling her how horrible of a mother she is, and forcing her out of the car. All in front of their 3 kids. 

We brought her home with us (our kids confused and curious), and my wife and she talked for a while more when we got home. She ultimately decided to walk home, and she did. But 10 minutes or so after she left we felt really uneasy about that, so my wife drove by their house. She found the wife walking in a different direction, and immediately picked her back up. The husband was not home with the kids and not responding to calls or texts. So the wife, locked out, was walking to a different friends house.  My wife convinced her to go to the police and they did. There, all of their secrets we're spilled to my wife. Husband is a crack addict with a long rap sheet of drugs, dui, and insurance fraud amongst other things.  After much back and forth, the police brought the wife home and waited for the husband. She did not press charges, and she has not taken the kids and left. Last night, they were all home together. 

This is very clearly a super-dangerous situation, and the wife doesn't seem to be making an effort to get herself and her kids safe. What can/should my wife and I do to help?

And for whatever it's worth, we live in a fairly affluent community, and this type of situation is very uncommon. I think fear of embarrassment is a driving factor in the wife's decision making process.

One night after a concert, we went for a walk down by this lake, there was even a walking bridge over a narrow part.  It was about 20 feet high.  She dared me to jump off it, I said I would only do it for a kiss.  She gave me a peck on the lips and pulled back when I went in for more. I then jumped off the bridge. She said the L word to me as I was swimming out of the lake.  I took her home to her parents house after that because it was getting light out.  We hung out a LOT.  She never talked about other guys.   We never had a situation where we didn't say good bye with out giving each other a hug.   - Also, I only spoke to one of my friends (my roommate) about not inviting her over cause I am in love with her and it hurts to get my hopes up.

-------------------------------

Sorry if the title is a bit weird. I wanted to tick all the boxes for requirements to post.  

**Background Info**

My boyfriend Bruce and I have been dating for about a year.  He's great. Sweet, caring, smart, assertive, and patient. I don't think I could ask for much more in a partner. His twin brother Chris is another issue all together. Chris is nice enough, but he is an extremely beta personality. He allows people to walk all over him because he is afraid of rejection or confrontation.  He is nice enough, but his ultimate loyalty lies to whatever girl is currently with him (he's gone through 3 in the last year alone.) and he can become a huge jerk to his friends and family if he thinks it will impress his current girl (being 'alpha' and all that, or whatever. He totally buys into the whole concept of Pick-Up-Artistry and, to some extent, the Red Pill.)

Anyway, Chris started dating Kristin about three months ago. She is the extremely jealous, gossipy type of girl who has huge insecurity issues (especially with other girls.) If she catches Chris talking to me (or any girls outside of his immediate family), she throws a fit and yells at him (sometimes to the point of tears.) I seriously dislike Kristin and how Chris is seeming to take on all her negative qualities. He's an OK guy when he isn't bending over backwards for mean girls.

*EDIT: out of the 3 girls, one girl was nice. She dumped him because he got ultra attached within a two week period and she felt it was too fast.  The second girl was also mean, but she was more direct than this one. The second girl isolated Chris from his family and also used him for money, but not nearly to the same extent as Kristin. Chris only let the second girl go because he met Kristin. He was seriously considering continuing his relationship with the second girl, despite her breaking up with him several times, except he met Kristin.*

**Here's a brief list of Kristin's most striking offenses:**

- She has 5K+ in credit card debt due to a very real and serious shopping addiction. As a result, she makes Chris her sugar daddy. He has a well-paying job but is starting to get into debt himself because of her addictions.

- When he tried to limit his spending so he could start saving again, he told her he would only spend a few hundred on her a month. She lost her shit and basically accused him of abusing her. She kicked him out of his own bedroom for 3 hours and wouldn't let him back until he came crying in (literally), saying she was right. 

- Despite wanting all his money, she also throws a bitch fit every day when he goes to work. It has gotten to the point where he actually asks for her permission to go to work, and she sulks until he decides not to go in or (if he does go) she chews him out after work.

- When she moved in, we divided up rent (half of rent is split equally -  shared expenses/shared space - and the other half is split as a percentage of our private room's square footage.) to include another person. Her rent is the lowest in the whole house ($130) due to her room being the smallest (by less than a fifth). Within the first week of her moving in, she sent Chris to confront the rest of the roomates about rent. She feels she has gained nothing and has no advantage by moving in, so she shouldn't pay anything (though she'd pitch in $60 a month just to be nice.) All the roommates rejected this idea, and she threw a bitch fit, saying Bruce's room is twice the size of mine, he should pay the difference!!! 

- *EDIT: I should establish that while SHE is not paying her portion of the rent, Chris is paying for her.  So, essentially, rent is divided between the 8 people here, but Chris is paying for both Chris and Kristin's portion of that pie.*

- She never has anything nice to say about anyone, and she always portrays herself in a positive light and everyone else in a negative light.  In any given situation, she is the frustrated victim that with whom no one properly empathizes and sympathizes. Everyone is her personal bully and she's the stoic girl who just puts up with it, blah blah blah.

**The Real Problem**

Despite all of the above issues (of which there are many, many more.), my biggest issue with her is that she has a personal vendetta against me.  She has ZERO cause to have an issue with me. ZERO! I have done nothing to her. The girl and I have not been alone in the same room together more than 5 minutes in the entire time I have known her. We don't talk to each other, we don't do stuff together, nothing.  When I first met her, I thought her standoffishness was just shyness, so I invited her out to (and paid for) lunch on two different occasions (with a couple other friends).  But then her behavior never softened. She never was anything but standoffish. And then she began using C against me to stir up trouble.  I'll give you some examples, but realize that all of this information about how she feels about me is coming through Chris. She refuses to speak to me face to face (or in any direct way - email, phone calls, texting, nothing.) She always uses Chris to speak for her.  

*EDIT: I will just add in real fast how fucking annoying it is for her to use Chris to speak for her.  She got mad at me for taking an active role in roommate meetings (I organized the meeting place, time, and topics up for discussion, like chores, fixing some broken appliances, splitting up storage between roomates, etc.  I only did the work because no one else was taking the initiative.), like I usurping her value within the group by being an active member.  The ONLY time she has ever messaged me EVER was when she sent me a fb message saying that I was a bully for trying to cut her out of group activities when I KNEW how much she wanted to be a full member of the group. Full member of the group? Bitch, you send Chris out to do all your dirty work. Don't claim you want a voice just to hand it on over to Chris to use!*

- I fb messaged all our roomates to meet up to discuss our sink disposal that had been broken for 3 months. I was tired of no one taking the initiative to get it fixed, so I sent out a message saying Hey guys, for those of you that will be home tonight, I would like to confirm plans to hire a plumber! If you can' t make it, that's ok. I will catch you up!  Kristin told Chris I was bullying her by trying to eliminate K's importance from the group and plan events without her. Chris called me out on a public fb forum for being a bully and that I needed to treat poor Kristin better. 

- The first night I met Kristin was when Chris asked Bruce and I to go on a double date with this new girl he had met.  So we agreed. We went to dinner and then to a museum.  Now, anyone who knows me knows that I am a chatty personality. I like to crack jokes and tease people (but never mean or personal jokes). Chris told me that Kristin decided from night one that she hated me because she felt I teased Chris too much. According to Chris, my teasing caused emotional trauma for Kristin that she has issues overcoming, hence her treatment of me.

- Bruce and I didn't give up trying to get Kristin to warm up to us. We kept inviting Kristin and Chris to spend time with us (at the movies, at home, we suggested many things.)  Kristin and Chris would accept the invites but wouldn't show up on time. They would be 1-3 hours late each time (almost always because Kristin would want to go shopping beforehand.) Bruce and I would get upset and say Chris, why are you so late? that is rude, we set a time and you could have told us if you would be late... We never confronted K about it since she was so new to the group, but Chris and Bruce are twin brothers so we thought they could talk it out reasonably.  Chris told us later on that Kristin began to resent me (but not Bruce.  Only me.)  for bullying Kristin.  She believes we have no right to be upset that they were so late and we just want to embarrass and hurt Kristin because Bruce and I are mean people.  

**Her treatment of me is so very passive aggressive:**

- She leaves the room when I enter. 
- She ignores me when I say hello, how ya doin?
- She shuts the door or walks away if I wave.
and so on. 

Chris admits that Kristin's behavior is immature and he doesn't like it, but he insists on mimicking her behavior because (1) it will make her feel not alone and (2) it will make her feel more comfortable, so she will naturally just evolve into a mature adult.  Chris is not a smart guy.

**This all came to a head today**

I got home from work and decided to watch some netflix on the TV (which is Bruce's and Chris') while I ate dinner.  This is the first opportunity in a while I have had to use the TV since Kristin has been playing video games non-stop for several days now (She has no school and no job.)  I was not even past my first episode of *30 Rock* when I heard Kristin and Chris coming down the stairs to the TV room. Kristin said she wanted to continue her video game, but she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw me, turned, and went back up the stairs. She said she wouldn't be downstairs while I was. 

During my second episode of *30 Rock*, Chris came downstairs and sat on the other end of the couch. He laughed at the show for a bit. Kristin appeared on the stairs in about a minute and growled (actually growled!!!) at him. He immediately stood up, liked a whipped dog.  He went to their room, she said something, and then he came out and said, hey, can we use the TV to play the video game? and something in me just kind of snapped.  I said, If Kristin would like a turn to use the TV, she can ask me, like any polite adult would.  He went back into their room to relay the message, and she slammed the door shut and locked it. 

In my own petty anger, I stayed out and watched 30 rock for about two hours even though I didn't care to watch that long. I wouldn't give up the TV just out of principle. It's just so god damn rude, and her treatment of me has been downright disgusting.   I finally decided to just unplug the XBOX and take it to my room, since it is mine.  

Not even  five minutes after I turned off the TV, I heard Kristin and Chris come out of their room and realize the XBOX was gone.  Kristin returned to their room, but sent Chris to ask for the XBOX back:

-  Chris said I had no right to take the XBOX since the TV was half his. 

- I told Chris I was not going to allow people to treat me poorly and use my property.  

- Chris said that, according to K's perception, she was not being mean and I was the one seeing it all wrong.

- I told Chris I was just expecting common decency and politeness, not special treatment, but she continues to treat me with disrespect and disdain (honestly, she seems like a drama whore to me) for no reason. 

- Chris said it wasn't no reason. 

-  I said that Kristin had no issue with being polite to everyone else in the house. 

- Chris said that I cause Kristin emotional trauma so we all just need to give her the time to deal with the trauma I dealt her. 
What the fuck. So she's justified in bullying me because she likes to play the victim? I don't think so.
 
- I told Chris that I don't accept that excuse and until he and K can start treating me like I am not a disgusting disease, they do not have permission to use my property. 

Chris relayed the messages to Kristin and then returned.  He suggested that we all need to talk it out since this is all just a big misunderstanding that I am blowing things out of proportion and getting mad over nothing (because K is doing nothing wrong!) I said fine, let's talk it out. I would be fine with going through all her so-called complaints and just ripping them to shreds for how stupid they are. But Chris said, Oh, but Kristin doesn't want to talk tonight. She's too emotionally exhausted by all this drama! Maybe tomorrow. I said it will be tomorrow or not at all, since Bruce and I are going out of town the following day.  And so much for emotionally exhausted; I can hear them in the common room now, laughing it up and playing a game on Chris' computer. 

Ugh, in any case, what can I do? Kristin is crazy and Chris is enough of a pussy that he defends her behavior and even mimics it despite knowing it is mean. I have to live with these people, at least for now, so what can I do? What can I say to make this talk pan out (if the talk ever happens?) Am I fucking crazy? Why is she behaving like a psycho?

My boyfriend is more of a peacemaker and I am a bit more of a firecracker (fuck peace if it means I'm not being treated with respect), but he supports me.  He has taken an active role - talking to Chris, defending me, saying Kristin's behavior is not OK and Chris shouldn't support it or mimic it... and Chris agrees!

i'm a female fire chief, been chief for a little over 2 years.  our dept had been running well up until this past year.  been working with this particular guy since 2010(?) and he always had nothing but respect and positivity towards me, but i did witness a lot of judgment and vindictiveness towards others by him before this issue began.  

**spring 2013:** i ended an abusive relationship.  asked my ex to leave my coworkers and family out of it.  so obviously, he went on sympathy-manipulation tour 2013, specifically targeting my coworkers and family.  

his main target was a fellow i'll call supervisor crazypants, who happened to hold a dual role of a dept officer &amp; a member of the governing board for the dept.  **important: he is not my supervisor (that is his role for the board), the entire board is.**  crazypants decided it was appropriate for him to be involved in my personal life to the point of trying to console / provide sympathy to my ex.  told him that i'd rather he was not involved, but he said he wanted to be due to the instability of my ex *(threatening suicide, threatening to burn down the house to get me there - then kill me, etc)*.

shortly after ending my relationship, i became involved with a friend.  not ideal timing, but life happens.  my ex suddenly decided this guy was the reason for the relationship ending (because it's obviously not him!), and proceeded to slash his tires, damage his vehicle, go psycho at his workplace (to the point of the workplace obtaining a restraining order). 

suddenly, supervisor crazypants begins questioning everything i do at work.  internally i resented his sudden attitude and arguing with me in front of subordinates.  crazypants then threatens my job in his role as a political leader by saying 'the only way he could fire me is if i neglected my duties' but that 'i'd better stop dating my boyfriend; i'd better not be seen in public with my boyfriend, etc.'  don't take kindly to threats, so i ignored him.  

**summer 2013:** he helps my ex violate my restraining order by passing on communication from him.  i turn that in to the police.  he then lied to the prosecutor, claiming he didn't know about the order, when he'd been informed multiple times by different people.  we had a seriously deteriorating relationship at this point.

**fall 2013:** around october, find out he's backstabbing me by attempting to slander me to the board, the other firefighters (classy), and anybody who would listen &amp; set me up to fail in certain situations.  fortunately, i have (had?) a good reputation and work to maintain relationships with people, so they told me about it.  

wrote a letter presenting his harassment to the entire board.  he then resigned from the department, claiming that 'it had been destroyed because they didn't take his advice and fire me'. he wrote a hilariously vindictive, immature resignation letter.  the board went to their attorney with the entire issue, &amp; the atty told supervisor crazypants to stop interfering with the department, as did the board.  

**spring 2014:** 5 months later, crazypants is still interfering, on an obsessive level (and still talking to my ex).  he's assaulted a FF, discriminated against me because of my gender, harassed and interfered with my work, tried to damage all of our department's professional relationships, tried being a personal investigator of all of our members, and fully neglected his actual job in doing so.  he keeps bringing up a bunch of issues that honestly exist with *any* rural department (to try to justify shutting it down), and existed while he was on the department - he just didn't mind them then. 

he's basically attempting to destroy our fire department since his resignation alone did not accomplish that.  i wrote another letter, and now we have 'mediation' on friday.  **important: he cannot be simply fired - he is an elected official.** 

psychologically, all i can figure is that he must be very insecure and threatened by strong females.  (sidenote: he has run off 3 other employees since he started his 'leader' role).  he absolutely refuses to admit any wrongdoing whatsoever.  and he's obviously projecting in his accusations of my 'neglecting my duties' or 'being a poor leader' because he had absolutely zero issues with me until he started being involved in my personal life.  actually, he was the person that had pleaded with me the most to take the job as chief.  

any advice?  (if anything needs clarification, please ask). i'm not even sure it's worth mediation at this point, the guy is a power-tripping nutcase.  i'll never be able to have a shred of respect for him again.  all i really want is to be able to do my job...or at least have a job left :(

11682,Non-Romantic,2a78f6,"My friend and I have a long history together. We were attached at the hip throughout our early 20s, had a falling out over her dating and eventually moving in with a boyfriend was aggressive towards me, and later rekindled when they broke up about 5 years ago. 

Since then, she has had a handful of boyfriends, during which periods we see each other infrequently. When she is single, we spend a lot of time together. We have a ton of fun, we're invested in one another's lives, and we offer each other unconditional, loving support. I love her dearly.

However, she is single again for the longest extended period since our early 20s, and I'm having a really difficult time with it. She's a doll, charming and pretty. Men flock to her.

This isn't a case of pure jealousy, though. I'm pretty attractive myself, confident too. 

We both can be rather insecure and needy with men. We struggle in equal measure with self-defeating behaviours, and so have difficulty developing healthy, long term relationships with men. This is one of our points of comparison. 

The point of contrast has been that I have always refused to enter into sexual competition with her. As a result, she has always blindly bowled me over, happily and thoughtlessly collecting adoring men. This has resulted in an entrenched pattern where when we go out, she shamelessly flirts with everyone (including men I have expressed interest in), and I sit back and feel like shit; she's feeding her hungry heart, and I'm denying that mine exists.

Clearly, this is not tenable, but I don't know how to remedy it. When I am feeling great and having a nice time around men with her, she reports that it makes her feel insecure. Censoring myself makes me feel worthless and invisible. When I address that with her, she feels bad for making me feel bad, but is unable to offer any solutions. 

I fear I am at an impasse with a dear friend. Dismantling our relationship is painful to even consider, but I don't even know if this kind of issue can be resolved. 

Does anyone have any experience with this?

I don't drink but the rest of them were getting pretty drunk. One of my friends, who has come from another city for a break, mentioned that he had some good housemates. I also mentioned that I had some good housemates (we have recently bought a house together). My other good friend said they are not good housemates, they decided to live with you.

I [24/F] live with two male housemates [30M/29M]. 
We've been living together for 1.5 years now and have good relationship with each other, despite of few minor ups and downs. It's a big house and we all have busy lives, so days easily go by without running into each others.

My housemates introduce me as 'annoying little sister they never asked for' to others, but they're caring and protective of me as I am of theirs. Although we're all busy, we try to hang out at least once a month or two. We're close but I think it works out for 3 of us because we respect each others' boundaries, or so I thought.


Yesterday, I went out to have a lunch with my friend for a bit and when I came back home, I realized the fan in my room was turned off. I remembered leaving it on when I left the house and the fan doesn't have a timer, so I thought maybe power went out for a bit? This happened few days ago when I came home from a night over at a friend's house, so this time I felt really odd about this. 

I was getting ready to go out again, changing and doing makeup etc, when one of my housemate said happy 4th, and don't forget to turn your fan off when you leave the house! as he was leaving the house. 

I was changing so couldn't go out and talked to him, but I asked if he came into my room while I was out. He said he didn't know how long I was going to be out for so came in and turned the fan off. 

He had to leave and I was changing so that was the end of conversation so far, but this really left me incredibly uncomfortable. 

I'm a somewhat private person who doesn't bring anybody over often. Only people I really brought into my room last 1.5 years were my best friend and boyfriend at the time. I feel that my room is my safe place where I can completely just be myself. This is why I always leave my door closed even during the hottest days.

I feel violated and uneasy that my housemate came into my room without telling me first. Also shocked by the fact he didn't tell me after the last time (few days beforehand). We've been trying to cut down electricity bill, so I understand he wanted me to turn off my fan while I'm out of the house. But I feel that this is something he should've talked to me instead of coming into the room with closed door. 

Am I over-reacting? I know I'm more private person than anybody I know, so I don't know if I'm just making bigger deal out of nothing. I adore my housemate and value our friendship, so I want to be careful addressing this issue.

11699,Non-Romantic,38yoaw,"Hi /r/relationships, I need some advice on how to get my younger sister (Mia, 16F) keen on going back to high school. Some background info:  

Mia is the daughter of my Dad (55M) and his wife/my stepmum Deb (~45F). Deb and my father have been together since I was 3 or so and have 3 children together - S(18F), Mia and R(12F). I grew up spending half the week with them and half the week with my mum, and have never considered them my 'stepsisters', just my sisters :). About 10y ago Dad, Deb and my sisters moved to a different city and I chose to stay with my Mum in our home city, my/our older brother (30M) and his partner (28F) also stayed, and now have 4 children. Mia and I get along really well and are very close.


Mia has been to 3 different high schools and left each one, starting with slowly trailing off/attending less/getting 'sick' etc up until she begs and pleads with my stepmum, who moved her each time, until the latest one (late last year), when Mia decided she simply didn't want to go to school and wanted to work instead. She has had some decent part-time jobs, but now works at Subway instead of going to school, she works about 25hrs a week, lies in bed the rest of the week and doesn't have many good friends (mostly because she doesn't go to school, and isn't that your whole social life at 16?). Fast forward to now: she has decided she wants to leave her city and come and live with myself/our brother, for the rest of the year/possibly longer.   


Because of the above issues (no solid social group, not committed to anything, and because I miss and love her heaps) I encouraged this 100% and have booked flights for her (obviously with permission from parents). The problem is school. I am really keen for her to attend high school up here. It'll be a fresh start for her, she can meet new people, she can get priority entry to the school I went to (she also has a friend from her city who has just started there). When I bring this up with her, she is reluctant because she feels she's already missed so much and that school doesn't work for her. Quote - I can try but I feel like it just won't work out again. This is really distressing. She plans to get a full-time job here which I don't think will be difficult for her but I don't understand why she would want to work a soul-sucking job when she has a great opportunity to start fresh. Money isn't really an issue, she will be supported by parents plus food and board is on myself and my brother. No big deal at all, we're just happy to have her here.     


I'm baffled that our parents have let it get this far. I feel like finishing high school is sort of a bare minimum and, academic repercussions aside, it helps shapes you as a person and make friends for life. I need help convincing her to enrol and actually convincing our parents to be harder on her. 16 in my opinion is too young to decide that school doesn't work for you and quit point-blank. Any ideas?? Jeepers this got long. Sorry, I got really into it.    

TL;DR; My parents let my little sister leave school at age 16 and she is moving cities to stay with me. I want help convincing/helping her go back to school so she can better her prospects.

11701,Non-Romantic,340695,"This is extremely painful to type right now, but I have no better alternative.


I just. don't know. how to move forward from here.

The friend I broke things off with (1 of 3 other roommates) (and 1 of two of my long standing friends that I went to high school with) I've been best friends with since 3rd grade. She was my first friend.
She isn't mentally stable. Depression. Anxiety. The usual. I couldn't take it anymore. Am I bad? Probably. I just have lost so much energy to put up with. Ever since she's been treating me poorly and turning me away. Like a second class person in comparison with everyone else. She hid things from me that she'd tell other people. Said that she was afraid that I'd be judgemental. I guess you can't change the way people already think about you.


We just hit a rough patch. Something out of my control. I apologized, but I guess I've always been shitty about apologizing. They wanted it verbally and I sent it written in a group message to the people it effected. Friend stopped talking to me, started slamming doors at me. It made me tired. It made me not want to talk to her. So I started thinking instead.

I thought for days about what our relationship has been. About how I'm always the one who has to try to fix things. About every slight little comment she's said to me. About all the times I've told my parents I need better friends. About how she always whispers about me to all my other roommates and talks about me to our friend from high school.

Our friend from high school. The three of us were inseparable. I was the third wheel, of course. The hard to love. The one with different interests and talents. the one who always had to make the plans, or else wasn't invited.

The unemotional. The private. The independent one. Am I supposed to be this robotic or have I just been alone in this crowded room for too long? How is it that I don't have one friend who I've told about my problems?

We were good friends, given that I first excepted the fact that I was the third wheel. That I would try to get together with them over breaks and they'd say they were busy and then post pictures of them both hanging out.

They just need some alone time without me, I'd think. I'm hard to love. How long ago did I take this role of the burden? The robot that would turn itself off and remain uninvolved on a shelf until convenient. Is that the only way people will tolerate me? I didn't feel friendship. I felt tolerated. And it made me so happy to be tolerated. The affection of an eye-roll.

You can't change the way a person already thinks of you. What happened when I started to want to be more than tolerated? People started whispering about me behind my back. Crippling anxiety.

Sometimes you don't realize how far you've sunk until you look up for air, and you see the big dark void of water, unyieldingly vast, looming over you. That's when you start thinking That's okay, I'm a fish anyway.

I'm a human being and I was drowning.

My friend that I broke things off with was toxic. She made the illusion that she was the most caring person ever. I see that she isn't. I'm alone in this. She's taking friends with her that I was hoping to keep, but I know I can't save them. Not with the way they look at me. They all think I ended things because of that one little rough patch. If that's how much you valued our friendship in the first place, then I can't say I'm sorry to see you go. Just because a friendship isn't always 100% beneficial to you doesn't mean it doesn't have value. I tried to explain, she blocked my phone number before I could.

Whenever something goes wrong and I'm treated poorly, I just cary it. I don't care enough to defend myself. I'm too tired to fight. I just have a panic attack every now and then and get on with it. Maybe this is all my fault for not fighting for our relationship but my anxiety is so physically painful I just needed out. She was dragging me down so much.

Now I'm alone. I'm just a Sophomore in college. I'm studying abroad in Europe in the fall, but when I get back, then what? Hell, even right now, I've got two months left living with people who hate me.

I've been spending the past two weekends hiking and rafting and doing all the things my friends made fun of me for wanting to do. It sucks because I'm so godamn awful at it all. I have a lot of catching up to do. That's the worst part is that at the end of it all, I'm still just a fucking aloof weirdo whose unexperienced in the things she has been deprived of like outdoor adventures, but also talking about my feelings and what a healthy relationship is supposed to be like.

I can't just turn myself off and put myself on a shelf until someone wants to use me again this time, or I'll just end up alone for the rest of my life. As my friend said, if you think you're ever going to find any relationship without its problems, then you're in for a really lonely future and I feel sorry for you.

Maybe I'm just meant to be alone. That's not statistically impossible at this point.

But I really liked these people. I liked having things in common with people. I don't know who else would want me, I have so much baggage and can't even comfortably hug anyone. How do I know it's not me who is the one that people should avoid? I've gone through 3 roommates now, and so far I'm the only common denominator.

So after my break up I finally met Chelsea and we had a ton of fun. She helped me a lot through my break up and I helped her through her break up(s). We spent hours chatting each day.

Then last year in July Chelsea had a huge fight with another close friend[19 F] of mine(call her Sandra). (this really does sound like a high school drama).  She made me choose between her and my other close friend. I told her that I'm not picking anyone's side. Both friends have been VERY supportive towards me so I'm not going to turn my back on either of them. ( I think I should also state that they were both in relationships so there was no romantic interest).

So over the last 6 months Chelsea has been in a relationship with a guy and our communication just basically stopped. I messaged her maybe two or three times in the last 6 months never really sparked into any meaningful conversation. In the time being I'm still talking to Sandra on a regular basis.

Now I've really been missing Chelsea a lot. It started to frustrate me to the point where I just decided to confront her and ask her what's going on? I want our friendship back.

She went off on a very long rant that I clearly picked Sandra's side and I never bothered talking to Chelsea in the last 6 months. SO why come back now? 

Now she absolutely refuses to be friends and I really don't want to lose our friendship. I miss the times we had together. I'd give anything to have her back, but no matter what I say or do she just keeps telling me to get lost.

Also many times I disagree or do not want to do something my mother wants me to do, its like I am demonized and turned into the worst person in the world.


* Recently my girlfriend stayed with me in my college dorm/apartment. She made me breakfast in the morning and took a picture that was later posted on her Facebook. My mother does not let my younger brother have complete control over his own Facebook page, and since I am friends with my younger brother she was able to see this picture that I was tagged in. She began to send me multi-page text messages, like always happens when I make her angry, about how it was bad for my and her reputations and that I should take it off my page. Then my girlfriend's mother commented on the picture with a funny comment and this set my mother off onto a tirade. She was shocked that my girlfriends mother would approve of such behavior, and she began to say that I had no morals, my girlfriend and her family had no morals, and that I need to start going back to Church (have not been in a long time).


* Yesterday, after talking to my girlfriend and thinking about how to handle this, I get a text message from my mother saying I have made some decisions that you are not going to like. She called me later that afternoon during a break in my classes and told me that I would be moving back home, I would start going back to church, and attacks on my girlfriend's family continued. I was told that I should not be having sleepovers with my girlfriend because we are not married, and that being at this stage of a relationship at a young age is not good or moral. I had my girlfriend with me for some encouragement because I decided to try to stand up to my mother and make my own argument, and I usually break down and cry when I try to argue with my mother.
I said that she needs to stop making decisions for me based on what she thinks is right and wrong because not everyone believes what she does. I said that posting the picture on Facebook may not have been a good idea, my girlfriend did apologize to me for it, but that does not mean that my girlfriend or her family are bad people. We have been together 2 and a half years. As I kept disagreeing with my mother she got more and more upset with me, I was trying to keep my cool as best I could, and said some very hateful things about my girlfriend and her mother. My mother said that she was drawing a line in the sand and that I had to go to church with her on easter, and I said I did not want to. It is not because its church its because she is demanding that I go. After I would not say yes she said I was not her son and hung up the phone.

I do not think its healthy to have this kind of relationship with my mother at twenty years old. However I am deathly scared of her, of what will happen if I do not give in to what she wants. My grandmother ran my mothers life and still does, and I do not want to end up that way. But I just do not know what to do now, and I am scared that I will break down and give in to her on everything.

Background: As soon as my brother [29m] and I graduated from college, my mom moved away to another state where her brother lived. In part to escape her gambling addiction and in part to start a new life. My dad bought her half of the house (they are divorced) and she used this money to buy a house in a new state. She has a good job in the new state but begins complaining almost immediately about the move. My brother and I come up to visit her during winter and spring break and the summers. She is miserable and it is painful to visit her on breaks. 

Fast forward a few years. She is behind on her mortgage. Despite having put down almost half of the value of the house in cash and having a nominal monthly payment, she is behind on her bills. We find out she has been gambling again. She took out all of her equity and gave it to the casinos. In addition, I find out that in the span of 4 years, she has borrowed thousands from her brother, my brother (her son), and our dad. On top of that, she had her brother cosign her mortgage and now he is on the hook for the house, too. I advise her to sell the house. She does nothing and they foreclose on the house. She is obviously depressed and has several excuses for where the money went. Everyone in the family is increasingly impatient with her.

After the foreclosure, employment becomes spotty. Long periods of unemployment followed by temp jobs here and there. She is living with a friend. Eventually she gets stable employment and stable living situation. 

Present day- she lost her job and has been back on unemployment. She claims that her unemployment is up and asks my dad for money or she will be homeless. My brother and I are going to have a talk with her tonight, but I have no idea what the outcome will be. Living in different states, I have no idea if her benefits have truly run out (and she is just playing my dad and intends to gamble with that money) or if she is really on the verge of being homeless. My dad called my brother and I to ask what to do. He is sympathetic to her situation, but does not want to enable her.

In addition to this, she is entitled to ~90k from my dad's retirement (via their divorce judgment). I believe she is near the age where she can access the money. I am worried that she will deplete this money quickly. 

I suspect that she is still gambling (and that if she is not still gambling, the only thing holding her back from it is the lack of funds). At a total loss for what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

20 years ago, my grandmother (on my mom's side) developed Alzheimer's, and thus began her 10 year battle. It was horrible and was very brutal on my mother, as she was the only one who was around to deal with it. I could go on and on about the toll it took on my mother both mentally and physically, but it would take too long.

The only other person alive to help her at the time was her brother (my uncle in question,) but he was a horrible asshole who was too selfish to give a shit about anyone else. In fact, he has always been very self-involved, and him and my mother never had a close relationship. He made a lot of money and ran his own
successful business. We used to have Thanksgiving together for years (he owned a box at our town's NFL team's stadium and we would always be invited,)
but he never even spoke to me once throughout all those years. I only know him as the man who gave me and my brothers impersonal cards signed by his secretary filled with money every Christmas.

He has 2 children- my cousins. They are now in their mid-to-late 20s. We have never been close with them either. The whole family has always been a bit alienated.
One cousin (Lily, mid 20s) lives at home with her mom (who divorced my uncle a long time ago) and the eldest other cousin (Stacy, almost 30) is currently a successful lawyer in another state across the country.

We have never had any open arguments with my cousins. We just don't speak to them much/aren't very close. But we have never spoken badly about one another at all.
When my grandmother died 10 years ago from her long battle with
Alzheimer's, we had her funeral on a Sunday. My uncle (AKA: her own son) did not come, however, because there was a football game on that day. I shit you not. He even gave us shit for having the funeral on a Sunday because obviously the football was more important to him.
He was also not present through her entire illness. Instead, he gave my mom grief. And now, at the funeral, he doesn't even show. Needless to say, we haven't spoken to him much since then. The yearly get-together at Thanksgiving pretty much stopped there.

Said uncle is now losing his own mind. He does not have Alzheimer's, but another form of dementia that is causing him to deteriorate at a
terribly quick pace. We think he may have suffered a stroke as well at some point, but bottom line is that he is no longer able to care for himself. Furthermore, he has lost his ability to remember much of anything about his past.

Originally, we thought he was going to pass away after his initial onset/visits the hospital where he had problems with blood clots. However, he somehow pulled through, and is now living at a nursing home. 

During the inital hospital scare, my mother decided to go sit by his side, and my cousins even made this option available to her, thinking that she would be saying goodbye to him forever. However, once he started to get better, my cousins changed their attitude pretty quickly.
My mother would try to go visit every week or so, and would text them asking for updates. They would often be resistent with releasing any info, and started to tell my mother she could no longer come visit her brother, and that all visits must be scheduled through Stacy beforehand.
Now my mother was very offended by this, mostly because Stacy is a 30 year old twat who NEVER said a word to us for the last 20 or so years, and just NOW decides to act as my mother's boss. She showed zero compassion for any of my mother's feelings pertaining to her own brother. Instead, she acted like a dictator, even going as far as to bitching my mom out and trying to put her in her place by telling her when she could see her own brother. She would even withold info on his health updates.
My mother didn't let this stop her for the most part. She knew what room he was in the ICU, and when he got moved to another room in the hospital, she called the nurses station and got the new room number.
But then came the day where they took my uncle to a nursing home, once he was discharged from the hospital finally.
My mother had to find out from a family friend which nursing home he went to. This family friend has worked for my uncle for years, but was giving info behind my cousins back because he knew they didnt want mother knowing.

We actually ended up going to the nursing home to visit my uncle. Lily was there. She is the quiet type who lets her older sister, Stacy, do all the talking. So as she saw us entering, she was too much of a pussy to say anything to our faces about not wanting my mother there. Instead, we sat and visited with both her and my uncle for about an hour, before they had to take him away for physical therapy.

Now we are getting to the meat of the story. Again, sorry for the length of all this.
My mother attempted to go see her brother again at the nursing home recently. Apparently, since he has been losing his mind, he is now the nicest he has ever been to her in her entire life. He actually enjoys talking with her, and is starting to remember tidbits on their past and their parents.
As she went to visit with him, she was pulled aside by a nurse who asked for my mother's name. When my mom told her, she informed my mom that she was not allowed there, and that her name was listed on the chart right next to my uncle's crazy girlfriend who is also banned from visiting. My mother immedietly became appaled that her name had ended up under the banned list. Apparently, after our last visit with Lily, she had done the pussy thing and went into the other room to text Stacy and tell her that we were there uninvited. Stacy then contacted the nurses and banned my mother from visiting again.
So my mom had to leave, very embarrased. She is very hurt that she can't visit her own brother, who actually asks for her company now. She even contacted Stacy and my ex-aunt to ask them why they did that. And just as cowards do, they did not reply to her.

Now, Reddit, tell me this. Are they legally allowed to do this? Please tell me if there's anything I can do to help. My poor mother is very upset, and you have no idea what she's been through her entire life. She does not deserve this. She's tried her whole damn life to be close to him, and now she's finally got a glimmer of a chance in all of this, and it's being stopped by two spoiled brats who don't even know her. They don't know any of us because, like their father, they are too self-involved to care.

Now I know some may ask, Why does your mom even want anything to do with this asshole? Truthfully, Reddit, my mother is alone in her family. She lost both her parents, she lost her sister when she was only 3 years old, and her brother is all that's left. Not to mention, my parents are divorced and mom lives alone. She is just trying to hold on to any family she has left. And like I said, she's finally got my uncle being nice to her. 

Please tell me what I can do to fix this situation. I want to write my cousins such a nasty letter, but I do not want to make matters worse. Like I said, can they really kick her out of the nursing home legally? It's not like they have a restraining order against her. She has never done anything wrong, and she has ALWAYS been supportive of my cousins.

He then told me that he felt like it was time that he and his girlfriend (a mutual friend of mine) broke up. His reasoning was that they had too many differing interests and that when they were together she only wanted to do what she wanted to do and not what he wanted to do. No kind of compromising ever worked apparently. They also decided to wait until marriage to have sex, but in the last few months they had been pushing boundaries and heading down a road where it was inevitable that they were going to fall. He told me that he was going to wait one more week to do it, but then he had an emotional breakdown and I knew that it was going to happen. So last night he went to her and made it official. I can tell that it's killing him. I've never been in this kind of a situation before. I'm not really sure what to do. I don't want to completely drop her off, but he's my bro and best friend.

I've made quick friends all my life. I was never popular but always found my group where ever I went. This was fine when I was younger. Now that I'm older I see my old College friends on facebook visiting eachother and hanging out, and I feel devastatingly lonely. I've never been good at keeping in touch long distance after I leave a place. I suppose I never learned how to because it was hard to do moving so often. My various college friends have tried to keep in touch by calling or facebooking me but I know I've pushed them away by not responding for months at a time (I was miserable living in New York and fell into a crippling depression for about 3 years, kind of fell off the face of the earth for a while)

But the fact that he has tons of friends (which are all great people) is starting to make me feel self conscious about not having any myself.

Today was a very stressful day.



First, a little back story on our cast: 



Mark: Our protagonist. Exceptionally vain but also very kind and 
personable. Loves to talk and make friends. Working on his confidence issues that sometimes lead to him seeking attention a little too much. 19 years old. Third in command at the store.



Laura: Friend of Mark’s for a month or so. Connected very close emotionally with Mark based on shared tastes and opinions, a real friendship candidate in the long-term. Very emotionally complex and interesting – a real natural friend. 16 years old. 



Cathy: Friend of Mark’s for a few months, open to a casual relationship, but Mark's been hesitant to take that step. 19 years old.



Tina: Friends with Mark for over 6 months, had a drunken makeout once and mutually decided to forget about it. 18 years old. 



Rob: Store manager. Knows everything. Literally omniscient as to what goes on in his store, nothing gets past him. No flicker of romantic interest, anything. Incredibly professional, a role model for keeping work separate from one’s personal life, and very admirable in this respect. 35-40 years old. 



First of all, it was an open interview day. We do one every so often where anyone can walk right into the store and get an interview on the spot with either myself or the other hiring manager. I was excited about it going into the shift because it would mean that I could possibly get a good amount of interview practice in. Prior to open interview day I had done perhaps 10 interviews total, so this was a good chance for me to really show my stuff. 



At about 2:30pm (I was 12-8), Rob asked me to come downstairs with him to discuss something. His attitude made me a little bit nervous, because I had no idea what I’d done wrong, but I was about to find out. We sat down in the office, and he began to tell me about a sexual harassment claim that had been launched against me. I had received several complaints that my conduct on the floor was of an inappropriate nature with certain crew members and they brought it to my store manager’s attention. I was so incredibly ashamed and shocked to hear this.



Laura and I had had a big fight about a week prior, which is unrelated but made her feel very uncomfortable with me. Some people don’t work out – I was sad to lose the friendship but I’m very certain of the way I felt on this topic and clearly we weren’t compatible based on it. However, pursuant to this fight, she told me after she finished working with me the next day that I had made her very uncomfortable and that she didn’t know how we could be friends, based not only on the fact that we disagreed but also that I had been very forward and flirtatious with her on a personal basis.

 

Now, I had, from the start, made it very clear to her that I was interested in knowing/possibly pursuing something with her completely separate from work, that my managerial title had nothing to do with us and that if anything ever went wrong that she could rely on my ability to maintain a perfect professional relationship. I thought I covered all my bases, didn’t I? This is how you make friends or start relationships within the same workplace? Apparently not. 



 I had told her in response that I was extremely sorry to have jeopardized her work environment or made her feel uncomfortable in her workplace, that it was never my intention and that we could freely revert to an only-professional relationship, no questions asked. She responded by telling me that it was nothing to do with work, that it was completely based on my forwardness and sexual interest in her and that she wanted none of that. (So things at work were, at this point, GOOD)  



I had apologized, but also defended myself to her in that I didn’t believe she was being fair to me – we had gone out several times prior and she had a real interest in continuing our relationship. She had had ample opportunities to tell me that I made her uncomfortable. Instead, she told me that she enjoyed the attention and was flattered, honestly. She told me she was excited to help me pick out furniture for my new place AFTER we had this fight, for goodness’ sake! 



Laura and I had agreed prior to any of this that since I wanted a casual relationship and she was only interested in committed relationships, that we would never work out. I assumed (wrongly, it seems) that it was okay to continue treating her flirtatiously since it was now clear to both of us that nothing would ever come of it. So I didn’t see this coming at all. 



Rob went on to say that he had gotten complaints from Laura and Tina based on my conduct with them and that he wanted to give me a chance to explain my perspective before he took action. I told him everything (in less detail, but I didn’t omit any facts) and we resolved that we’d keep a record of this conversation in form of a documentation and that I’d shut down any ongoing relationships I had with team members in order to protect myself. 



How naïve of me to assume that I’d be able to be a professional and still get away with this on the side. I jeopardized my workplace and I’m scared for myself if she decides to take it farther, but I’m also very upset because from their perspective, given that they broke the ice and went to Rob, they must have been made to feel so incredibly uncomfortable by my presence. And it’s so scary to me to wonder how long this has been going on as I was completely oblivious. How much of what she said to me was the truth? Did she lie about picking out the furniture? Was she only hanging out with me because she was scared to say no? Did I never make a friend at all? But most importantly, I was making my team feel scared of my presence? It was never my intent and I feel so God damn ashamed. 



This is all very confusing to me as I was really sure that I was making great strides for myself. It’s hard for me to meet people given that I’m working most of the time and it’s all shift work. And my social skills improved by leaps and bounds thanks to work! I met so many people, made so many friends, and now everything is at risk because I… what, I made a bad judgment call when I decided to pursue Laura? I would have enjoyed a casually sexual relationship but I was so satisfied with friendship! 



I was prepared to settle and perish the thought of ever having that kind of relationship with her as we’d already agreed she’d never be interested. I thought I covered my bases and now everything is in danger. Deeply troubled but fully aware of what I had to do, I returned to the floor. 



By 7:30 when I had to start turning people away so the closing manager could take his break, I was exhausted. Tired of talking, head was spinning, couldn’t see straight. I pretty much fiddled around and ran an okay floor for that half hour, and then I was out the door at 8 on the dot. On my way out, I ran into Cathy, and asked her to meet with me outside once she’d changed and was ready to go. 



Upon meeting with Cathy, I made it clear to her that I would no longer engage in any sort of unprofessional relationship with her and that that was it. We were done. Despite the fact that ours was actually by far the most stable of any of my work interests, my job has always been my first priority and I would never, ever risk it over one little subset of all the possible relationships one can have from the world. That was my first step. 



My next steps are: 



1)	Meet with Laura and apologize to her for being anything less than professional. Make it clear that she has the right to a professional work environment without being put at risk by my behaviors and that she will never have to worry about my being unprofessional again. 



2)	Meet with Tina and apologize to her for making her feel so uncomfortable. Let her know that she and I will be strictly professional from now on and apologize for jeopardizing her work environment. 



3)	Refrain from inviting team members to do things or participating in activities with team members outside of the regular scope of work (outings, etc). This is to protect myself. 



4)	Continue to journal my thoughts, feelings, and progress on this matter as I tackle this situation. Hopefully, this is the end of it.



Now, I save all of my text messages, so everything pursuant to this that either of us has ever said is saved. And I'm confident that it'll be defense enough for me if we ever get to the stage where I need it (Hopefully, I won't.) I made a genuine mistake and I won't do it again... but it makes it hard to trust people and I resent Laura a little bit for that. I won't try to make friends in my workplace again. 



Tina was only mentioned so that you have the whole story -- she and I have really had very few problems and I suspect her name was only brought to the store manager's attention by Laura as evidence that I'm flirtatious with more than one person, as certainly we were flirtatious at one point but we also had (I thought) a pretty good friendship. I honestly can't imagine her doing anything like this, or even having reason to. We've barely talked for months. 



TL;DR: Employee-personal-friend-relationship-interests launched a sexual harassment claim against me. It came out of nowhere as until I heard about it I was sure that we were doing very well on a personal basis and though the main plaintiff and I had a fight regarding my flirtatious treatment of her, she made it clear that it wasn't about work at all and then did this.

I do have other more casual friends from work, with whom I'll get drinks or see a movie sometimes, but these two are really the only ones who spend time at my house and so on, and that's where the problem arises.

To get right to the crux of the issue: I have OCD. Not in the ooh, I like to color-code things sense, in the crippling anxiety and strange ritual-like behaviors sense. I'm not as bad off as some people, but it definitely affects my life negatively. 

*******Begin possibly boring/unnecessary backstory*******

This largely stems from my upbringing. My dad was never around, and my mom had some undiagnosed mental illness, so my home life was turbulent and in some cases straight-up abusive. For example, my little sister and I were often forced to eat food that had gone bad, which would make us very sick, because, you kids are just being picky and don't want to eat your food. We also had little to no access to healthcare - not because my family couldn't afford it, but because my mom was always convinced we were faking it - so if we got sick or injured, we were basically fucked. I still have some hearing loss from an untreated ear infection. We were gaslighted constantly...not intentionally on my mom's part, but she would hallucinate something we'd done and then punish us for it, fully convinced that we'd done something that never happened.

*******End possibly boring/unnecessary backstory*******

I like to think I've done pretty well for myself despite all that - I have a good job in the field I went to college for, I have no debt, I have a healthy and loving relationship with my boyfriend - but some of the effects are still there. These largely have to do with cleanliness and fear of germs/illness. Examples include:

* Panic attacks for days or weeks before holidays and big events (friends'/family's birthdays, Christmas, etc) because I'm so afraid I'm going to accidentally get someone I love sick or harm them somehow.

* Needing to keep my living space clean. Most of it I'm actually relatively sane about, but I'm genuinely obsessive about the kitchen (again, fear of foodborne illness). 

* Needlessly frequent hand-washing.

* Paranoia about infectious diseases and bodily fluids - internally freaking out if someone I doesn't know touches my bare skin, fear of peoples' blood, etc.

* Keeping all my stuff in very specific places (e.g. keys stay on the counter if I'm in the house, scissors always in the top drawer, etc). This is less due to liking organization, and more due to the fact that I measure my own sanity by my ability to keep track of things. I don't always trust my own memory, so misplacing/losing things is really upsetting to me.

Believe it or not, this is actually leaps and bounds better than I used to be (thanks to therapy). Six years ago my hands were permanently cracked and bleeding from overwashing, and I was probably two steps away from being a genuine shut-in because I was so terrified of the outside world.

Splendid pretty much knows my life story, as we've been friends since middle school and she witnessed, firsthand, some of what I went through. Max is a more recent friend from college, but he and Splendid and I click great. I know I'm not painting the most flattering picture of them here, but they really are unusually great friends to me in most ways.

Here's the thing, though; no matter how many times I ask them to avoid doing certain things that trigger my OCD, it seems like they either forget, or start doing something similar but not exactly the same. And while I try to ignore the smaller things and control my reactions, I feel like some of the things they do would be considered rude even by a normal person. Some examples:

* I bought a brand new car less than a month ago, after saving and only riding a bike for years. Max got into my car and put his feet up on the dashboard, getting dirt and grass everywhere. When I got home, I had to spend 30 minutes cleaning the inside of my car before I felt it was safe again.

* Splendid will regularly come into my house and throw all her stuff (backpack, ice skates, notebooks, bike helmet, whatever) onto my kitchen countertop. I ask her every time to please put it on the couch or someplace else where food doesn't go, but she always forgets.

* Max often drinks/eats things of mine without asking. For example, he came over the other day (already tipsy) and I'd left a 3/4-empty bottle of bourbon on the kitchen table. I turned around to do something, and when I turned back he was drinking straight from the bottle. I ended up having to throw it away because I had a stupid irrational panic attack about his saliva being on/in it. It's not so much that I mourn the loss of that particular bourbon, but I was kind of baffled; I'd never just walk into someone's house and put my mouth on their liquor bottles.

* Splendid will often leave stuff of mine in random places instead of where she found it. She always asks before using things, which I appreciate, but then she'll leave it in another room or cram it in a drawer somewhere and I won't be able to find it when I need it, which I find unreasonably upsetting.

I don't know what to think of this. On the one hand, I know I'm truly uptight and that can't be fun to be around. It's not fair of me to impose my genuinely crazy standards on the people around me, because my mental health problems aren't their responsibility.

On the other hand, it's getting to a point where I don't feel comfortable having Max or Splendid in my living space anymore. I love seeing them, and they're always genuinely sorry when I tell them to please stop doing something, but I still end up feeling unclean and emotionally exhausted once they leave. 

I guess I just want some outside perspective on this (besides my therapist's, but it's kind of her job to be supportive so I don't think she's particularly unbiased here). Please, don't be hesitant to give me an attitude check if I'm being horrible to my friends - at this point, I think I may need it.

11800,Non-Romantic,1yqx1j,"   My extended family is pretty small. It's just my brother, me, and two cousins. Lately inter-family relationships have been very strained do to infighting over my grandfathers inheritance. It's complicated, awful, and I won't get into it here. However - my one cousin is now getting married down in the Key West and has sent out his invitations. Family is pretty much expected to attend. 

The hotel fees alone will be over $1000 for the week not including the cost of planned trips such as snorkeling or sailing. My boyfriend and I are planning to attend college across state by next year. We both work but are barely keeping our heads above water as it (i.e I consider getting my hair cut a splurge and am in process of applying for food stamps). Already we're biting our nails trying to figure out how to pay for the move and tuition fees in the future. 

 In addition his side of the family(my uncle) is wealthy. I had a little hope that maybe they would extend a hand to help pay for the flight or hotel fees but it hasn't come to pass. Is it unreasonable to turn down the invitation because I just can't afford it? Would it be rude? I know the family would freak out at me for not going, but without help I just don't know how I could do it.

11808,Non-Romantic,2lew6f,"Here's my problem: I am in my late 20's and recently married. My husband and I have a lot of mutual friends, most of them married and we each have some just us friends - friends that are closer to one
or the other person. 

Anyway, one of our mutual friends is having a birthday soon. His wife will be out of town that week so she wanted to throw him a surprise party to occur while she's gone.
The catch is she only invited the male friends, including my husband. So my jimmies are getting all rustled, because, well nobody likes getting excluded.

I'd consider myself a closer friend to the B-day boy then a few of the guys going, who are more of acquaintances, and it sucks that I can't celebrate my friends birthday cause I've got a vajay.

What's probably making this worse is we just finished up with a long gauntlet of weddings, and therefore bachelor parties. A bunch of parties where my husband and my friends were having out having a blast and I got left home. (no bachelorette parties in this group - wtf) 

I understand the bachelor parties. I'm cool getting left out of bachelor parties (okay well, jealous but still cool) But birthday parties? C'mon!

So... I don't know. I'm mostly just bitching. My old friend groups never really divided down gender lines as much as this group does, so I'm just feeling out of my league.

My husband, who was pretty bummed when he got the invite, suggested writing a short email to the wife and then the group basically asking if she's super firm on the guys-only aspect and if it would be okay if I (and one of the other wives) came too.

I'm hesitant because I always felt that it's rude to invite yourself to someone elses party but on the other hand the snub is really bumming me out.

11810,Non-Romantic,2u0amd,"Hello reddit,
I am currently moved out of home for grad school, but I have a close relationship with my Mom (am only child), and I skype her (and our live-in grandma) every day.   
   
Although we are very close, yes, this has been a very complicated relationship at times (my mother being extremely assertive about things either being done 100% her way or no way[from how dinner will be served, to exactly what I should wear for a particular occassion, etc], having choleric explosions when things aren't done her way - not just in regards to me, but also my grandma, for example, etc.). So yes, when we lived together/spend a lot of time together, there are sometimes tough times. (But in the end of the day, she still loves me more than anything, would do anything in the world for me, and I want to give her the same treatment back.)   
   
**But** when we are separated and just talk about our day regularly, there are no big fights like at home, so **there is no reason for me to get annoyed**, and I should just be enjoying her precious presence. But I somehow....can't. I don't know what it is, I love this woman and I often think about how sad it is that I am moved so far away from her, yet when I do talk to her, she manages to drive me mad so easily and I don't always enjoy our time together. It's like I trained myself for that or so, and now it's involuntary.      
   
For example, today's phone call: my mom had a problem with her teeth, so she spent 45 minutes literally having a monologue about that. That's the way she always speaks - very descriptive, very much the style *and then I went there and I was sitting there and waiting and then this doctor opened the door but he had one more patient, so I had to still wait* - just the sort of style that doesn't leave out any detail.      
   
I get that it's very important for her to tell her story and have somebody to pour herself out to [separated from our Dad; it's just her and grandma], and she would get upset if I interrupted her. But these kind of descriptions drive me crazy and I just get so...high strung so easily afterwards, I don't even know. For example, after this description, she wanted to see the room that I freshly moved into, and naturally, had a lot of comments about how I have done things around there, prompting me about whether perhaps they could be rearranged in different ways.   
   
Reddit, **it drove me crazy**. I know - I feel like a bitch just writing that. After she finished, I was snappy like a fucking little bratty teenager, to the point that I felt like I was divided into two people: one of them, my inner voice, going *wtf, girl, why are you so emotional, so high strung, just calm down*, but the other voice just overruling me and always giving these snappy, annoyed answers because no matter what, I almost involuntarily perceived all her critical comments like almost personal attacks. To be fair, sometimes she is brutally critical, despite meaning well: e.g. went to a ball, comments afterwards: 1)why did you let your hair down, you know how messy it looks 2)that much hair really makes you look tiny and fat 3)what is that coat? it looks sort of shrunk 4)why did you take those old watch, you could have grabbed the nicer one for such occasion 5)no seriously, you know I the curly hair down just doesn't look good. But today **she didn't even mean to be critical, and I just couldn't handle it anyway**.   
   
Reddit, do you ever have the same problem? How do I train myself to have a more mature, measured and calm approach? How do I not mix my nerves into the relationship? I think I do fine in every day life, but these conversations with mom leave me feeling like an over emotional irrational teenager. I don't wanna look back one day (hopefully decades and decades away) when, god forbid, I don't have my mother anymore, and just hate myself for always being a bitch to her, when she's the most important person I have :(.

11823,Non-Romantic,2ctkuc,"So, my buddy Jeff. I love him. He is like a brother to me. Jeff has a very limited history, romantically speaking. He dated a girl in high school for three years, and he dated another girl in college for three years. And those two women make up about 50% of his total experience with women. Jeff's main problem is that he goes after people he deems 'safe', almost always close friends, and when they reject him he plays it cool before pursuing the same avenue several months later.

I have spoken with him about this before. He plays it cool when I bring it up. I am pretty soft with him. I use euphemistic language like better strategies and unlikely scenarios. Maybe I am too cold and clinical? I don't know.

Well, right now Jeff is really into one of his superiors at work, Nicki. He is at one of those West Coast tech companies full of vibrant young people who have blurred their professional and social lives to the point of total non-distinction. He has been into Nicki since around Christmas, and many of his coworkers/friends quickly found out about his interest. They would try to pair the two together during their frequent group social outings. When Nicki found out about Jeff's interest in March, she basically said thanks but no thanks, I cherish you as a friend, etc, etc, etc.

Jeff was devastated, of course, and I was very supportive. That is, I was very supportive until I found out that he was only going to back off and focus elsewhere while his friends/coworkers continued to try and butter up Nicki for him. Well, lo and behold he tried his luck again on the 4th of July and it was a no go. Because duh.

I figured that was the end of it. Jeff was actually talking about finding a job elsewhere because he felt uncomfortable working with Nicki after all of this. Frankly, I'm surprised she didn't feel uncomfortable working with Jeff. But that's beside the point.

Today he blows up my cell phone--not literally. He sends me a charcoal sketch he did last night. It's a sleeping woman. It's Nicki. Nicki likes it, he says. But he isn't happy with it. He needs to do another, he says, with fewer mistakes.

I am so beyond hearing him talk about Nicki. But I don't know what to do. How sharp is too sharp when it comes to addressing a well-intended but misguided friend? His friends from work continue to spur him on, from what he says. I don't know. Am I a bad friend for not supporting this?

My mother posted about it to Facebook about four hours before I saw it.  No missed calls to my home phone or cell and no texts, she made no attempt to tell me in any way.

I'm... Angry.  Plain and simple.  This is not the way any person should be given bad news.  To be fair, we have known my grandmother would be going soon, its been a long battle with a dibilitating disease and short battle with untreatable cancer.  But my mother and I have a close enough relationship that I was expecting a phone call at the least.

I recognize that she lost her mother, and that she's in pain.  Maybe she didn't want to call?  So I texted and told her that I loved her and was thinking of her.  She responds her thanks and tells me that she went out to dinner with friends and is doing well.  So now I'm even more angry that she appears  just fine and couldn't even bother to let me know what happened.

I started a job at a restaurant three months ago. I work full time hours there, and have worked at a restaurant before and know how to serve.

The majority of workers there are under 25 years, with the bosses (owners) over 30 years old. A wife and husband team own the place. 

Some backstory: I've had some issues with the full time bartender who is also a manager. She bullies me, bosses me around and has yelled at me infront of customers before. I talked to my female boss about it, and she said she had my back, that the girl was jealous because I threaten her job security. She said the plan was to become friendly with each other, so the bartender will lay off me and stop bullying me. She has, and I thought we were becoming friends or something (I am coming to the conclusion I am naive).

I'm a powerlifter/gym nut. I eat my oatmeal everday, I have visible muscle and get comments on my shape quite frequently from customers. I'm by no means a body builder, but I've got shapely arms, legs, ass the whole thing. 

Today I got called into the office and was given a talk. Word is, people feel uncomfortable working around me. My male boss told me for such a small girl, you take up a lot of space. You walk around with your body puffed up like you own the place. People are scared of you. They call you Arnold and Hulk Hogan. You need to change, your job is in jeapardy.

I was honestly stunned. I think what he was trying to say is that sometimes I get thoughtless and don't yield to other workers (like at the coffee station etc). But he brought up all this teasing that is going on and I don't know how to move forward. Everyone is so friendly to me. I'm actually a nice person, I try to make small talk and be chummy and fun.

11898,Non-Romantic,1s6c79,"This might be a little long. About a month and a half ago, my SO and I moved in with a friend of ours. She's not the most intelligent or responsible of characters, but we've never had any conflicts before. She bought a house with her ex and had an extra room, we were looking for a transition home as we moved out of our parents.  We figured it'd be beneficial for both of us. She'd have help paying for a house she can't afford, we would have a place to stay until we found a place of our own.  She charged more than is fair, we tried to negotiate. She didn't respond kindly to that so we decided to just suck it up and pay for it. Things have gone fairly smoothly.  We keep the place clean, are respectful to her schedule and possesions, and are at work or college most of the day anyway. 

Also, we have a well mannered small dog and a mostly outdoor cat. I gave her a guarantee when we moved in that they were free of parasites and treated for fleas. They get baths every other week and I comb them regularly.  She has two dogs that consistently piss on the floor, seriously harass our pets, and rarely (every two months, they're long haired) get baths.

Fast forward to this weekend, when out of the blue she calls me upstairs, where I get bombarded by not her, but her mother. She very rudely proceeded to tell me that I brought a flea infestation into the house.  That the treatment we gave our pets wasn't good enough. That we gave her daughters dogs fleas and have probably infested the entire house. That her daughter doesn't have money to pay for the vet. That we should be grateful her daughter was letting us live there (even though she likely couldn't pay for her home on her own). Her daughter sat quietly by, her only words being I can't have an infested house.


Now, it took a lot of effort, but I managed to keep my cool.  I didn't bring up other frustrations with her. I just said that we gave them a guarantee when we moved in that our pets were clean, have kept up with their treatment, and do not currently have any fleas. I wanted to point out that her dogs probably have fleas because they do not get baths and are never treated for fleas, but because she already looked like she was going to hit me, I declined. She continued to press me to pay for her dogs to go to the vet, I did not give in. The next day we tested our pets for worms (negative) and fleas (negative) and gave them prescription flea treatment/prevention.  We promptly informed our roommate on this, thinking it would settle the issue.

It didn't. She avoids us entirely. She complains about us with our mutual friends. We can hear her talking shit about us from other ends of the house regularly. The other day I heard her talking about calling the police on us.  We haven't done anything even remotely near deserving a police call, and are not worried about any claim she may make. But we don't want this to spiral into a Jerry Springer shitstorm either, and clearly she's completely irrational.

We don't know what we have done to upset her. We're quiet, clean, and friendly, despite how rude she's being. But she's clearly still upset and irrational about her feelings, and is not telling us about it all. She had not said anything to us about fleas until her mother was yelling at me.

11918,Non-Romantic,2q4n0b,"I am currently enrolled in college full-time and occasionally socialize with two girls, we'll call them Ashley and Amber, who are also in my program during breaks.

Approximately two months ago, on one such occasion, we were doing school work in the campus restaurant. All three of us had laptops on the table, along with drinks and food. Unfortunately, during one of my elaborate stories accompanied with hand gestures, I accidentally knocked over a glass of water on the table and some of it spilled on Ashley's laptop. She screamed bloody murder and made a huge scene and just started to cry. Luckily, myself and Amber acted quickly, held the laptop upside down, dried as much as we could with napkins and RAN to the campus computer repair shop. 

The guys at the repair shop took it apart, dried it out with some sort of a vacuum, and it booted back up perfectly. I asked them how much it would be for the cleaning/vacuuming and was willing to pay for it. They said don't worry about it, its on us. For the remainder of the semester, Ashley's computer worked just fine, bringing it to class every day with no complaints.

Fast forward to this evening....almost two months later. She sends me a video of her computer acting funny. The screen is alternating between a picture of her and her boyfriend as the wallpaper, and a blank white screen. 

This is the following exchange of texts:

Ashley- Hey bad news my computer is screwed up really bad...

Ashley- I'm bringing it into apple this week to see if it can be saved or if it needs to be replaced. 

Me- That sucks your computer isn't working! Not sure what you are expecting of me. It worked for almost two months and it could be a number of other factors why it isn't working. 

Ashley- Well I would expect you to replace it.

Me- Not happening. Your computer was fine! God knows what's happened to it since. I'm sorry it is not working but it is not my problem. 

Ashley- It's being checked right now to see if its something else like hardware. If it is water damage then I will be asking you to replace it. And if you refuse, I will take you to court. 

Me- Taking me to court? LOL. You have no case. You left your laptop out at a RESTAURANT. It was an accident. You have no way of proving that months later your computer problems are my fault. Your kids could have spilled something on it...who knows! I have family members who are lawyers. Your threat does not intimidate me. Do not contact me about this again. 

Ashley- Wow, your making this ugly. I'm not trying to threaten you. The simple fact is you spilled a glass of water on my laptop with a room full of witnesses and now its not working. Simple as that. Like I'm trying to make things work for the both of us. 

I am broke. My boyfriend and I are barely making ends meet right now. 
I am no position to shell out $1500 for a new Apple laptop for her, nor do I think that is reasonable considering the circumstances. For one, shit happens. We were all negligent to have our computers out on the table and it could have been any of ours. And I mean a lot can happen in two months. She has two small children. A dog. I can think of 1000 other things that could have happened in that time frame. 

The truth is, I AM scared that this girl is going to come after me, and was totally bullshitting about having family members in law. In the weeks that followed she mentioned in passing conversations about suing someone for an auto accident that resulted in her sore neck and laughing about how it really wasn't sore but fuck him he can't prove it. According to Amber, she also forged a note to get out of a major exam. As these things came to light afterward, I started to get this sick feeling in my stomach that if ANYTHING happened in the future with that computer, she would blame it on me. And voila, here we are. 

So a few questions:
1) Is it possible for water damage to rear its ugly head again after the computer was fine for a significant period of time?
2) Does she have a case against me? (I am in Ontario, Canada)
3) How should I handle this going forward if she continues to harass me about this?

I didn't think we were being obnoxiously loud at all, but, okay. I told him I'd try to keep it down.

Now we're usually asleep by 10-11PM so he would bang on the walls at random hours, it could be 2PM or 5PM, and we aren't loud. We're both gamers, and usually we just have headphones on or we're watching stuff together, but never being obnoxiously loud. I actually think we're quiet as fuck. It's gotten to the point where I'm paranoid to have sex in my own home. I'm trying to be more accomodating because I don't want him to make my life a living hell, but I don't know what to do. I pay a fair amount of money for this place and I've already decided to not renew the lease, which is up in a few months, but does anyone have any advice as to what I can do? He bangs on the walls like 1-2 times a week, and at least once a week he knocks at our door to complain. Last time he did it, I just said, This is my house and I pay to live here. I'm sorry that whatever we do disturbs you, but we are as quiet as it will get. If you don't like it, you can wear ear plugs and get a white noise machine for when you sleep. That's what we do, since our upstairs neighbours have dogs who bark all day and they stomp around at night. He said he would call the cops on us. I've also noticed that it seems he knocks on our door when he knows my boyfriend isn't home, which makes me a little uneasy.

11960,Non-Romantic,2p992a,"I'm an 18 year old Dutch student, I'm studying in Amsterdam and really want to move over there as soon as possible. Sadly, most decent and affordable student housing has a waiting period of 2-3 years. I could get lucky, but I have no way of knowing when I'm going to get my opportunity.

I've known for some time that my stepfather's father owns an apartment building in Amsterdam, and has been working on converting them into a student housing project. I heard it from my parents, and at the time we were disappointed that neither him or his wife had ever asked if I might be interested in living there. I never really mentioned that I was actively searching for a place to live, but it still seems like something they could have at least thought about, because they definitely knew I was studying in Amsterdam. We don't have a bad relationship in any way, and we see each other pretty frequently. My stepfather has been with my mother for almost 10 years, so we all know each other pretty well. We just assumed they genuinely hadn't thought about it, or perhaps the fact that I'm not real family made a difference. My parents and I aren't people that would get on their knees and ask for a favor that big, so we just made our peace with it.

Now a couple of days ago, the grandfather and his wife came to my sister's birthday party. When they asked how everything was going I said everything was fine, and nonchalantly mentioned I was looking for a place to live in Amsterdam. Suddenly, they very enthusiastically started telling me all about their housing project, and it basically turned into a sales pitch. I saw pictures and heard all the details, and it's truly fantastic. The location is perfect, the rooms are beautiful and furnished, the facilities are great and everything is brand new. It has everything any student would dream for, and they told me they'd let me pick my own room. When I asked about the price, they said it would be around €600/month. That's a bit above my budget, I would have to get a job and maybe even a student loan. That's okay though, I would happily have done those things for such a beautiful place to live. 

After the price was mentioned and they continued the sales pitch, my mom gave me a couple of grave looks. I just assumed she thought it would be a bad idea to start living above my means like that, but that didn't turn out to be the case. After everyone left the party, she told me that she had spoken to their biological granddaughter [18F] a couple of days ago. She's also studying in Amsterdam, and apparently the grandfather had proposed the same idea to her, except that he's only asking €300/month for it. That's a ridiculously low price for such a prime location in the most expensive city in the Netherlands. When I initially heard this, I was pissed. He had looked me straight in the eyes and told me that it was going to be about €600, and smilingly told me I should probably get a job in Amsterdam. After thinking about it a little more, I realized how unique the opportunity remained. I was never going to get a deal this good anymore, even at €600 it's a beautiful place. I also realized I really couldn't be pissed at him for not cutting me a deal, after all it's *his* housing project. He's losing money if he offers two people such a big discount. However, my enthusiasm has sunken a bit. My parents tell me it's probably a bad idea, and they just know that there's going to be trouble somewhere down the road if I choose to go through with it. And even apart from all this, it may be a bad idea to have a family member as a landlord. 

So what do you think? Should I just wait for something else to come along? I'm convinced I'm not going to find anything as nice as this, but perhaps I could just live there for a couple of months until I find something else. I really need to get out of the house.

11965,Non-Romantic,1w738k,"I'm feeling really confused and like I'm getting mixed messages here, so any clarification would be helpful.  I'm also feeling like my brother and sister in law are managing me, which is a really infuriating feeling!

My brother and his wife got married last summer in her hometown, which is 750 miles away from where they live and where most of my family lives (except me - I live in a third place that's a significant distance from both of those places.  Sorry to be so nonspecific).  I was one of her bridesmaids, was invited to the bachelorette, helped plan her shower, the whole nine yards.  To me, that indicated that my sister in law wanted to try to foster a closer relationship with me.  

However, I don't think that is the case anymore.  Ever since they got married, I've felt like things are weird.  They hosted Thanksgiving for 11 people, which included her parents, her siblings, my parents, my other brother, and my grandmother.  To me, that was another indicator that they wanted to create a whole family relationship.  However, my side of the family was shuttled out the door almost immediately after dinner, while (as I found out later) her side of the family stayed for five days and had an extended amount of family time together.

The following week, I asked my brother what his Christmas plans were, and he told me that he and his wife were going to her family's house.  Okay, cool, no big deal.  Except that that turned out to be a fourteen-day vacation at their house.  I came back to my parents' hometown (which is only a half hour from where my brother and wife live) for six days, using up what little vacation time I had left after spending the rest on their wedding and wedding festivities, and didn't get to see them once because they were so far away for so long.  

My mother and grandmother both cried on Christmas because they weren't going to get to see their whole family together even once during the Christmas season, and because despite the fact that my brother and his wife live so close, they had seen him only once since the wedding, on Thanksgiving Day.  They called on Christmas Day, but only for about 15 minutes.

Now I am really confused.  Their Christmas present arrived to me in the mail with a card saying how much they missed me and loved me, but they haven't called.  I've called my brother once and left a voice mail, but he hasn't answered back.  I am feeling like I (as well as the rest of my family) am being completely shut out from their lives, and I don't understand why based on the efforts that both me and my sister in law made to strengthen our relationship during the wedding planning.  

What do you think is going on here?  I am concerned that maybe my brother is in a controlling relationship, because I can't think of any other reason that he would tell us how much he cares about us, but not make any effort to get in touch or to see us during such a special time of year... or any other time, really.

11967,Non-Romantic,2k284x,"My divorced parents are engaged in a legal battle regarding child custody and support. My dad told me his attorney will be calling me...

Some background...

I'm in SC, and my parents are, too (at the moment). They have been divorced for years now. They have 5 kids, two of which are under 18 [11M], [15M]. My mom has primary custody, and my dad gets them on the weekends and Wednesday evening. Anyway, they are both completely uncooperative and are in contempt of their court agreement. They couldn't work it out between themselves, so they're letting the courts decide. Let me explain:

My dad hasn't paid child support in over 2 years. He was at one point, but he fell on some hard times and ended up on my couch. He was either unemployed or underemployed for most of that time. He stayed at my place for nearly a year while making the payments, but eventually stopped so that he could get back on his feet. He should have filed for a reduced amount during this time, but he never did and so he was stuck paying the full amount (I think this was about $850 or so). It's been a slow recovery for him, but he only just recently found a decent stable job where he's able to provide for himself.

Now, back to my mom for a little bit. She works a nearly minimum wage job and struggles to support herself and my two younger brothers. A little before my dad stopped paying child support, she started dating her current boyfriend. He's very well off and has generously offered to pay her rent every month, which was what the child support money was being used for. He even has a job and a house for her. The only problem is that it's several states over, where he currently lives. My mom would like to go, but she's not allowed to move the kids over the state line. In the meantime, she worries about his patience with her and her situation. She had meant to file papers to be granted permission to move, but she tends to drag her feet. Well, just recently she did.

My dad was served with papers to appear at a hearing for her request to move. Or, that's what he thought it was. He misinterpreted the papers and ended up missing the hearing concerning the move, at which my mom was granted temporary permission to leave the state. The date he originally be was actually a hearing for his contempt of court for not paying child support, and he didn't realize this until two days before it happened. Anyway, in that hearing he was given a suspended sentence of 90 days, which he would have to serve unless he met certain conditions. He didn't tell me what they were, only that they were unrealistic. I assume he has to pay all back child support, which he can't do. He also likely doesn't have any friends or relatives willing to loan him the money. I'm not sure what will happen.

Anyway, back to my mom a bit, because I mentioned that she is in contempt as well. She hasn't upheld the visitation schedule for my borthers.  My dad gets to see my brothers when they want to see them, not when the agreement states. My youngest brother (11) hasn't wanted to see him for maybe about 3 years, and my mom has never made him go. My other brother (15) does ocassionally. Sometimes my mom will take them on trips during weekends where he's supposed to have them and won't notify him. She's also not supposed to have overnight guests, which she has done. Additionally, I think my mom's required to keep my dad notified of their school activities as well, but she doesn't. My dad has ended up missing a lot of events and he's pretty upset about it because he geniunely does want to be a part of their lives. 

So what we have now is a lot of finger pointing. Personally, I think they're both wrong and need to grow up. Still, I try to have a positive relationship with both of them without getting involved in their battles. But my dad is now going to try to take my mom to court for her contempt and is going to have his attorney contact me for an affidavit. I don't know what to expect here and I really don't want to get involved. If I were to voluntarily make a statement, I think my mom would interpret this as an attack against her. If I refused to, however, I think that might leave my dad in a difficult position (not sure what other evidence he has), but I think he'd probably understand. Even if I did make a statement, I'm not really sure what I would say. I try to stay out of all this as much as possible, so I'm not really going to have any specific dates or instances--I try to block it out and it all just seems like a haze, even though I have a general understanding of the situation.

Any advice here on how to handle this tactfully? I'd greatly appreciate it.

I used to be friends with a gal for two years, before we dissolved our friendship. I have know her since Middle School, and we only started spending time together for the last two years of high school. 


Things were great at first, almost perfect as a matter of a fact. The two of us always had fun together going to park and movies; we always found things to talk about, and we were all around pretty good friends. I actually began appreciating her quite a lot, and now I would consider it an honor of having to know her; but things changed to bad very suddenly (to which I will get back to a bit later).


You see, she and I had the same friends for the most part. I was friends with three guys who have been spending time with me 
ever since 7th grade, we played Rock Band together, did video game tournaments together, went of road trips, and etc. So in short, we were very close to one another.


One week, I texted that girl with whom I was buddies with, and she hasn't responded, which I didn't think of anything because people are busy, so I left it at one text that day. The next day I send a text, got no response. I thought of it as a bit unusual, but again, I left it at one message that day, and decided to wait a week or so to see if she gets back to me, she didn't.


So, after a week of not hearing a word from her, I asked one of my dude friends if they knew what was going on, and he responded with, She's just weird, don't worry about it. I thought to myself, Well, yes she is a bit goofy, but staying in constant contact for most of the time and then falling off the face of the Earth without a warning, is a bit odd. Perhaps something happened in her family, and she doesn't want to talk about it? I suppose since no one is saying that something happened to her, it is best to wait for a response from her without bothering her.


Couple of days after my dude friend game that cryptic answer, I went to a local park in my town. I just walked around the gardens, admired the beautiful weather, and enjoyed the free time I got from work. Then, I see a familiar long haired redhead out in the distance, and you guessed it, it was her. I came up to her, and said, Hello, how are you doing? She didn't say anything in return, she just glanced in my direction, and kept on waling as if I was a complete stranger. At that moment, I felt lost and confused. What has just happened? Why did she just do that? I just stopped dead in my tracks, and watched her walk down the paved path, and disappear behind the corner of tall shrubs.


A couple days after the last run in with her, I grew very frustrated by how no one showed any kind of intrests in helping me figure out what happened. My guy friends didn't want to do anything for me with this situation, and her girl friends didn't want to help me either. I got very frustrated by all the cryptic answers everyone gave me, and I just got so angry that I took my car and drove over 100 miles per hour to the next major city area up in the mountains and came back around back home after reaching the city. I know that looking back now, it was dangerous and reckless, and I should have known better, but the way things were unfolding was straight out of a nightmare for me.


So, a week later, I calmed down, took time off from work to go to the beach and just took things easy for that week. I then thought about where I stood with everyone, and made the decision to call each of my friends and tell them that it is time to part our ways. The response everyone gave to me was poor, everyone has lashed out at me as if it is my fault that all the things happened because of me, and that I am making a mistake. I then got down to her on my contact list, what I heard from her was quite painful.


She pretty much said that I am a psychopath for breaking up with all of my friends, and that everyone she knows, and I quote, Has been telling me to tell you to fuck off. I wasn't happy to hear those words come out of her mouth, so I told her that she was a fool and a sheep for listening to what others have been telling you to do.


Months passed since our talk, and I just sent her an apology letter for what I have said during our last conversation. She texted me some time later apologizing herself, and we mended things. However, it was very short lived.


After couple of months of on and off text message exchanging, I asked her to go to the movies. She agreed, so we went out to see American Hustle, and had a great time. I dropped her off home, wished her good night, and went home. Two days later I texted her about helping me out with which book I should get for pleasure reading, but got no answer. Then sometime later I found out she got a boyfriend, whom I didn't know what's so ever, and he became instant buddies with my former friends because they play music together. Since then, she only spoke with me just recently because she needed help with her computer, and that is about it.


I honestly have no idea what happened, I have a feeling that it were my friends who set something up to make her end things with me, but why do it in such a dirty and disrespectful nature, I don't know. Bottom line, I got no friends now. All I do now a days is go to the movies by myself, play games at home, do homework, go to college, and work. I have to admit though, I miss her greatly. I have been trying to move on for almost a year now, but the pain doesn't get any easier. I feel as if I am trapped, and I can't find a way out on my own, and that no one wants to help me. I want to be able to say that to her, but I know that she would take it the wrong way, and my former friends would make fun of me for it.

I am currently 24 years old and am having problems within my group of girl friends. I have always found it difficult to get along with girls, I find it easier to talk to boys mainly because of their lack of bitching and backstabbing. But over the years I have forced myself to try to make an effort with my girl friends in the hope that I can have a group of female friends who I can do 'girly' things with. 

All through high school (girls only high school) I had a best friend..we were inseparable and were so for many years. I will refer to this friend as SAM (23 yrs old)

To this day I remain in close contact with Sam, we know each others families and my Fiance is good friends with her husband. 

Next we have Mary who is a little older than me and Sam (27 yrs). I met this friend when I first met my Fiance. She belonged to his group of friends, due to the fact that she was (and still is) dating his very close mate. As we developed our relationship, myself and Mary also started to develop a close bond. Our friendship has been growing over the past 4 years. Over the years we have gotten extremely close..texting/calling eachother to see how the others day is going or just to say hi. When either of us are having an issue with something in our lives, we look to eachother for advice or comfort. We would see each other regularly (2 or 3 times a week), even Christening their son and making us God Parents. Now, Mary has another friend...we do not see eye to eye and have not much in common. There is no bitching whatsoever between us and no arguments. We just simply have nothing in common to talk about. But out of respect for Mary,  we keep things civil and mature. We say hello and goodbye to eachother and occasionally ask how things are...this is Michelle (22 yrs old). 

Now up until recently...(3 weeks ago), Sam has never met Mary or Michelle. We had our engagement party and invited Sam and Mary along with their husbands and of course both couples attended. We decided to introduce them to eachother and seat them at the same table in the hope that they would keep each other company and get along. Like we expected, they got on extremely well, they exchanged details and made plans to hang out another time. 

Two days later Sam was inviting Mary and her partner over to their house. We were invited, however could not make it due to work. There was another time after that, that we couldnt make it because of the same reason. As you can see...we work alot and have uni commitment also. 


Cut a very long story short...Mary introduced Sam and Michelle to each other somewhere along the lines...and, of course got on very well.  All the while, we were not told of their meeting until one night they unexpectedly showed up to Sams house when we were having dinner with Mary and her husband too.  Ever since then Sam, Mary and Michelle have been hanging out together every day and night. Posting pictures on facebook etc. We have caught up with them a few times (not as often as everyone else has because of our busy lives) and I have started to feel extremely uncomfortable. I cant join into many of their conversations because I dont really know what they are talking about. I feel like I have been left on the outside. 

My friendship with Mary has now changed, I no longer get a call/text from her every day and when I do see her it seams as though she is too busy with Sam and Michelle that she doesn't have time to catch up with me. I feel like the 3 of them have created such a close bond over a very short period of time, and there is no longer room for me. 

I feel as though I am losing my friends (which was what I originally feared about introducing them to each other). I feel left out of a lot, probably because I dont have lots of spare time on my hands like they do. 

When we are all together I feel like I want to leave because of how uncomfortable and left out I feel. It like all the problems girls usually go through with friends in high school is all coming back. The back stabbing, the drama and the constant need to play with one particular person in the group's emotions. 

Last night particularly was bad for me, I was not spoken to by either Sam or Mary. And felt like going home the minute I walked through the door. I tried to make an effort for the sake of my Fiance and his friends relationship...but I ended up getting more upset then ever.


Am I right to be feeling like Im being left out? or should I stop analysing everything and believe that what they are doing in unintentional and something I need to work through myself. Am I caring way too much? Do I speak to them about how im feeling or will this make things much worse because im showing my emotions? Should I put everything aside for the boys sake?

I grew up with my mother.  She was 19 when she had me, and although she did as much as she could, she didn’t have much of a support network, she lived on welfare or minimum wage, and it could be rough.  It culminated one day with me being kicked out at 15, me refusing contact thereafter, and we’ve been estranged since.  There's a lot more to it than that, but I don't know how pertinent it is.
  
  
  
After she kicked me out, a friend’s family sort of illegally adopted me and helped me complete school.  After many years, I’m coming to the end of my degree now.   
  
  
  
This year I looked up and found the guy that my mother said was the name of my father (she told me once, when she wasn't all there, but otherwise would refuse to say).  I found and met up with the man's mother twice, who was very kind. But the man himself had a lengthy prison sentence he only completed relatively recently.  It was for drug and assault charges in association with his gang, and despite his best intentions he is still involved with that gang (his mother was telling me about how he was discussing his new-found daughter in the gang house/pad/whatever you call it).  A lot of my biological extended family are apparently in prison, in the gang, or gang affiliated.  Some of them, however, got out of the lifestyle and have done really well, a few even in the field I’m going into (which would be really cool to get to know them on that basis).  
  
  
  
I don't mean to be judgmental either, but doing the math in my head, the man would have had to be mid 30s when he was sleeping with my mother.  I don't know this man's character but the information I have makes me unsure if I want to know him.
  
  
  
Has anyone else gone through this??  I feel like I’m staring at Pandora’s box that I won’t be able to snap shut again afterwards. 
  
    
  
  
I just need to make a decision on this.  I keep deferring this and it's been half a year since I've seen her, she keeps texting me asking when she can see me next.  It’s easy to not make a decision but I need to figure this shit out.  It isn’t fair to string along the grandmother and she was just so fucking lovely, living by herself in the middle of the countryside I worry she's lonely too.  
  
  
  
I expressed my reluctance meeting the bio-father and although not pressuring me, she didn't seem to process that.  Because he lives in the same area as her I would really not like it if I showed up and my bio-dad was there.  Even when I went last time, she had my half-brother over and introduced us, which caught me off-guard.  I bear no resemblance to my mother in complexion or face-shape but my half brother had extremely strong resemblance to me in this regard - he even shared my really particular crooked teeth, so that kind of sealed the deal in my head that we're related.  He's only young, and even now he's hanging out with family members in the gang, asking for a gun, mocking police, that kind of thing.  Shit, I don't know.  He's such a nice kid.
  
  
  
Have you guys had any experience with this??  Or advice?  I'm back in that area this weekend and I've resolved to make up my mind before I go down.  I'll either shut it down or move forward.  
  
  
   
**tl;dr**: I found my biological father this year but he’s a convicted gang member and the extended family are in and out of trouble with the law with their own troubles.  The grandma is nice though, but she wants me to meet the family.  Has anyone else gone through this??  What the hell do I do? 
  
  
 ______
  
  
  
**Edit: Thanks a lot for your various insights and advice.  There's a consensus that getting involved with the gang-related extended family is a terrible idea, totally in line with my thinking.  I'm still not 100% sure I don't want to see the grandma again, and I should explain further.**
  
  
  
**When I've met up with her she's explained all the trouble she's had with the gang over the years and tried to get people out of it a lot (raising quite a few of her grandkids to get them away from it all, getting CPS to remove kids from the gang, for example, and not letting those heavily involved in the gangs round her house).  She's not fond of it at all.  Additionally, when I went to visit her I didn't explain the seriousness of how much I don't want to see the extended family (she told me on the spot and I needed time to process that).  On the other hand, I'm still reluctant as she's family oriented and still visits them at the gang house, for example.**
  
  
  
**I've made the decision to seek further advice from someone who's an ex-police officer, who's worked undercover in gangs, and getting kids out of them.  They have experienced how gangs operate regarding families and whether it's feasible to try get to know the grandma or if it's absolutely not worth it.  Thanks a lot for your advice, you've all made me feel pretty sure that the extended family is totally out of the picture and it might actually be best to walk away from this.**

First of all, Nick has struggled with depression on and off for years. On top of that, he has had a rough year. Nick was dumped by two serious girlfriends, quit his job, and got denied for another job. There are other minor incidents, but I will cut to the chase. He has been unemployed for the last 6 months and has relied on odd jobs and selling drugs for income. 

Following his most recent breakup (~2 months ago) his drug use has increased in every measure. He is using harder drugs, in higher doses, with increasing frequency. I think his depression is being exacerbated by the types of drugs he is using; cocaine, MDMA, MDA, valium, alcohol, and most recently opiates. 

Whitney and Nick have been close friends their entire lives, and Nick's current state is very troubling to Whitney (and myself). Whitney has seen him battle depression and drugs in the past, but she has stated many times it has never been this bad. He is using language about ending it all, etc. that is causing both of us to worry about him all the time. 

I don't know what to do. My opinion is that he needs therapy (at least), but having a conversation with him is intimidating. He is sensitive to any sort of criticism, usually becoming defensive, then getting really down on himself (I'm such a horrible person, etc.). Also, I am really worried about saying something to him and tarnishing our long friendship or putting strain between him and Whitney.

My fiance and I got engaged back in September. We are proving to be amazing partners when it comes to making decisions together. Venue, photography, music, and almost everything in between. We've even been pretty good about discussing the important marriage issues that we might encounter in the upcoming years. Children, living space, careers, dreams and goals. 

With all these discussions and decisions occurring, we've finally come across something that has stumped us, Name Changes. 

Growing up in a Catholic family as a girl, it's been ingrained that my last name was never going to stay the same. I never thought twice about it. Until my fiance addressed that he really doesn't like his last name. His last name can be used as first name, for example James. He expressed that he was fed up with always getting the questions for his actual last name and the annoyance it brings with it.

But I often fall victim to not only what others might think but what my family might think of it. I know this question should be posed to them first, but I want to get a general consensus and tips and tools to figure out if this is what we really want. 

I would gladly give my fiance my last name, but the stigma might get the best of me and I'll chicken out.

I lived with Lisa throughout college. Towards the end, she got in a relationship with Becca. I never particularly liked Becca because I thought Becca was kind of crazy. She also came with this weird warning because she had dated Lisa's ex-friend and the friend felt that Becca was abusive, so she flipped out when Lisa started dating her (but the friend was still close with Becca and that's how Lisa met her? It was a small gay community at our school and I think Lisa brushed it off as lesbian drama). More on that later!

I could probably talk forever about the actual relationship between Lisa and Becca, but I will skip most of it. In my opinion, it was messed up from the beginning, but Lisa was happy. I personally thought she was exhausted and it seemed like she was constantly working on *something* for things to be smooth between them, but to be fair, she did genuinely love Becca. Becca fostered codependency and there were times Lisa enjoyed that feeling. (I am leaving out a lot here; it was clear from the beginning to everyone involved, including Becca, that Becca was mentally ill. She was being treated for severe ADHD and that is what she strongly believes she has. It seems FAR more like Borderline Personality Disorder.)

Things got more intense when we graduated college. Becca demanded a *lot* from Lisa, in large part because I think Becca felt she literally couldn't function on her own. She'd shower Lisa with a ton of affection and demand unbelievable intensity in return -- Lisa would have to pick up a call at any time to console Becca on anything and everything, leave work, make sure she was eating, it was basically like raising a child sometimes. Lisa was preparing for a very intense 8 yr graduate school so she decided she needed freedom. She began the break up process in...maybe December? Perhaps earlier. But they were on-and-off until Lisa actually left the next September.

That brings us to now. It's been 9 months with Lisa in another city. And her friend's warning has become clear. Becca is a difficult and demanding girlfriend, but she is an abusive ex-girlfriend.

She self-harms and tells Lisa about it. For a while there were rules about how often Lisa had to call/contact her and if Lisa didn't follow them, she *freaked out* (to Lisa's credit, she negotiated the rules away, but wtf...). She finds out about Lisa's dating life (it's included men) and becomes irate (especially about the guys, I don't know why that is particularly bad but she flies into a serious rage), but then tells Lisa really inappropriate things about her own sex life to make her jealous I guess? I don't know. There have been times when Lisa has not made the designated call appointment time so Becca freaks out and asks if Lisa is having sex and it's honestly like abusive SO behavior but they AREN'T together! She is demanding and cruel: a recent jab was that Lisa was so awkward socially without her so she was lucky that Becca would be coming to her birthday party. (But Becca is coming earlier than Lisa wanted and so Lisa now has to leave her classes early to accommodate Becca. When Lisa complained, Becca went into a whole thing, I thought you wanted me there, isn't this important to you, etc.) This is just a sampling of Becca's recent behavior. 

To me this seems so obvious. GO NO CONTACT. This entire relationship has been a mess and right now Becca is being insane. But Lisa feels like Becca gives her a kind of support she can't get from anyone else. I think that Becca has groomed Lisa to feel this way. Lisa's deeper worry is that if she cuts out of Becca's life, Becca hurt herself or worse (with the self-harm worries and increasingly desperate BPD-like behavior). But Becca has a girlfriend now -- Lisa can't be her support system.

I get calls from Lisa a lot when she is in tears. She's not been doing well recently and there are a lot of things she is struggling with. But when the thing that's wrong is Becca, I don't know what to say. I know that it's far more complicated than I realize because there are other dynamics at play and Lisa probably does not feel she has agency here. When Lisa calls about Becca, Lisa feels like *she* is the one who is crazy or did something wrong. She always has an excuse for Becca. By this point, it makes me physically sick to hear. 

**TL;DR**: My friend broke up with her ex at least 9 months ago and now her ex is emotionally abusing her; I hear about it on a regular basis. Is there *anything* I can do or say to make this situation end? How can I lend an ear when Lisa calls when I feel so strongly that this is wrong, wrong, wrong and Lisa is making the wrong choices? I love her but this is insane. 

===

ONE IMPORTANT DETAIL I FORGOT TO INCLUDE but now I don't know where to put it: Lisa was violently raped our sophomore year and Becca helped her heal sexually after a traumatic flashback incident shortly before Lisa went to grad school. I don't think Becca knows the full details of what happened; even I don't know everything yet and it happened in the room we shared. Lisa told one friend everything that happened and the friend actually DUMPED her as a friend (like with a fully written out email) the next day because she didn't feel an emotional connection as a friend (?!). Lisa accordingly has few people she really trusts so it's hard for her to just cut someone out. ",My [23F] best friend [24F] is in an abusive situation with her ex [27F].

12026,Non-Romantic,1pf7f7,"Hey there. 

Two of my good friends recently had a falling out. I stayed as neutral as possible although my name was dropped a few times (Ask Cattastic, she will tell you I did X, Y, Z). I supported both of them in the ending of their unhealthy friendship. 

I pulled each of them aside and told them that I didn't care about the drama, and I just wanted everyone to be normalsauce for my wedding. I told one of them in particular to NOT say anything (I need to talk to her and tell her that things can't be weird for your wedding!!!). I told her the best way to make sure things aren't weird is just to move on. Not engage. Just go about your business, avoid each other. Don't talk to anyone about it while you are there, don't make weird faces. Just be normal and everything will be fine. No one needs to have a big talk about it. 

So, today I get a message from the other friend. She told me that she will love to be there for the ceremony, but will not be staying for the reception. The day is all about you **and your new combined family**, and being there will be uncomfortable. I emphasize her word choice because the friend she had a falling-out with happens to be the cousin of my husband-to-be. 

I am honestly pretty upset and put out. As a friend, it would be most supportive for her to be there for my wedding and reception and to celebrate with me. If the day really were all about me as everyone likes to pretend weddings are, then she would be able to suck it up for a few hours over petty drama with an old friend and just have a drink with some other friends of ours, then gracefully leave. If it were all about me, she wouldn't put me in the position of mediating. 

The simple answer would be to tell her pretty much what I just wrote above. I am not unwilling to do that. Unfortunately, if I come out and say all this stuff NOW, it will guarantee things to be weird the day of. And I don't want any part of it to begin with. I just want to pretend like everything is fine until the wedding is over, lol. I don't want to deal with it. It's not my drama. Do I really have to send her a message that will now make things weird between US? I am not going to force her to stay for the reception, but now I know for sure the whole day she is going to be totally tense and awkward--she was supposed to come with my mom and a friend to the venue and help set up. 

Is there any way to respond to this that would not further make things uncomfortable?

12036,Non-Romantic,262ol7,"I'll start here. I've had a pretty unstable road with personal relationships.

My parents were overbearing and overprotective when I was growing up. At times physically abusive. My nonna pretty much raised me as much as she could before she died, since my parents are very hot-headed, neglectful and emotionally absent when you need them but always in your business when you don't want them there. It's hard to explain but it is sucky.

Growing up like that messed me up a little and as a result I've battled depression ever since I could remember.

Three years ago I ended contact with them because they wouldn't stop meddling in my life and trying to control it. If you didn't live the life they wanted for you they were not very nice about it. In fact, pretty much if you said no to anything they were not nice...at all.

So I just decided it's better for me to cut them out for my sanity. I know a lot of people choose to deal with this and I only am to a certain extent.

The rest of my family kind of distanced themselves from me ever since. They're set in their ways and back then you just stuck with your family no matter what they did. 

But being in therapy especially taught me that it's healthy to cut out anyone (no matter who they are) who is negatively impacting your life.

Brings me to this. My sister and brother and I have remained pretty close despite everything. They are still in contact with my parents but it never poses as a problem.

When my sister was 24 she had a miscarriage. When going to the doctor she was told she cannot have children. It was an awful experience for her and I helped her.

My lease was ending on my apartment and I even moved closer to her to be with her during this time. She would call me at any time of day and night to talk and I would talk to her unless I was working.

Recently I've made a decision to not have kids myself. It's not something I've ever wanted and honestly with my struggles with depression I don't want to risk bringing a child into that.

I've discussed with both my brother and my best friend (along with my fiancee who I've been with 5 years that agrees with this choice) this choice I've made. I or my fiancee are looking into sterilization.

I knew that telling my sister wouldn't be easy and honestly I understand why it upsets her a bit. But I didn't expect the outlash that I got.

At first she broke down and cried, telling me how could I do this to her, she can't have a baby and she wants one, and I can and I'm choosing not to have one. Things like that. I apologized and tried to explain my life choices but she would not have it.

She was calling me names like bitch, cunt, and the like. She told me she would no longer be coming to my wedding and wants nothing to do with me.

I left her house after that to tell her that she can calm down and talk to her husband and work through these things then we can talk, because some hurtful things were being said.

She harassed me with texts, calling me names still, and told me that she wishes that I were dead instead of her unborn child. 

I took this as heat of the moment things. It's typical with my family. If they don't like a life choice you are making (minor things like diets and pet breeds, bigger things like relationships and careers) they will throw a fit, call you names, do whatever they can to hurt you until they get their way. 

And if I stand my ground and don't give them my way, they stop talking to me for a week and then come back acting like nothing happened.

Each day the texts got meaner. 

She told me I was the black sheep of the family, that I was always different from everyone else and such a fucked up human being. She told me that she's starting to accept I won't have a child only for the sole reason that no child deserves a mother who isn't even strong enough to live her own life and can't take care of herself. 

She left voicemails. In them she took more and more jabs at my mental health. 

Then the texts from my parents started over-flooding my phone. I had to turn it off at work because it was vibrating a lot with the amount of texts I was getting.

My parents were saying things like how could you be so selfish, your poor sister, you don't care enough about us to give us a grandchild, etc. As if I would have even let them see their grandchild if I had a kid...no way I'd subject them to that toxic environment.

All of this is just overwhelming. It definitely makes me feel like I've made the right decision not to bring a child into this toxic, drama-filled family. 

But I honestly didn't expect this from my sister. We've grown so close. I was there for her as much as I could be. But I just can't force myself to have a child I absolutely don't want. I tried to be as patient and sensitive as I could be.

I asked my friends for advice and they told me that I shouldn't cut her out because she's family. But I don't feel like that's fair. I'm living my life for me, I don't honestly feel right keeping someone around who thinks these awful things to me, or could say these awful things to me the second they are offended by a choice that shouldn't even matter...

I can't deal with this from my family anymore. But I honestly need to know if anyone's been through this, if anyone has any advice to offer. If I would be a shitty person to cut my sister out over this?

She decided that they should have their cage in her room so that she could play with them all the time, and it turned out that I had to do the messy business of cleaning up after them, litter training and socialising them with each other because she wouldn't. I also ended up being the one responsible for providing them with what they needed (cage, water bottles, food, hay, etc.), as well as booking and paying vet appointments. It was fine though, the rabbits were happy and well cared for. 

My sister moved out and left the two with me. I made a few changes to their lifestyles that she wouldn't permit before such as letting them wander the house, changing their food to what the vet recommended and feeding them less (the vet said she was overfeeding them) which she is upset about and often scolds me for.

I have been caring for them by myself for half a year now, and she says that when she moves into an apartment that allows animals she is taking them because they are hers and they love her more.

I really love these rabbits. It makes me happy when one walks up to me to lick me, or jumps onto my lap and hides their head in my arms. I don't know how to tell her no without offending her, as my sister can become violently angry and I am very timid and fear loud noises. Last time she was upset she threw the furniture around the house and broke things and I curled up into a ball and had a panic attack.

My father physically abused me and she came down to my room immediately afterwards to tell me that he had done nothing wrong and that nobody (including authorities) would believe me anyway. She told me that she and I would never share the bond that her own child would ever have. Meanwhile I had been distracting their daughter, Indigo, for the 2-4 years of constant arguments about their money situation. I understand that my dad feels guilt, however, when I express my feelings to him, he takes them as insult and attack. I feel that this is due to the fact that he is in love with his partner, and does't want to lose what he has. Gimme an up or down, but best would be your honest opinion. Thanks.

12065,Non-Romantic,3aoak2,"I'm very distraught at the events of this evening but I will try to be as clear as possible and stick to the necessary details.


I am the second oldest of a family eight [including parents], I have five siblings. My bother is the next one after me, he is 24 and had a very rough life/childhood related to medical issues.


When he was 3 or 4 it was found that he had cancer infecting one of his kidneys, after several treatments were tried and failed they removed the kidney and he has been cancer free, ‘single-kidneyed’ and healthy until he was around 14 and his other kidney failed. Found a donor, successful transplant and healthy ever since other than some extra anti-rejection meds now and again.


After the initial recovery from the transplant and him trying to live a normal teenage life it has still been very rough for him. He was a rebellious teen (not **super** unexpected, but hard to deal with none the less). Had undesirable friends through high school who were not that great an influence on him. 


Through the years he has stolen from us (his siblings and parents) both money (credit cards, debit cards, cash, etc..) and possessions (some we think he might have pawned, others maybe he used for a bit and then ditched or gave them to friends as “gifts”). In the last 3 or 4 years he has progressed to stealing our cars when his is in the shop or stuck somewhere on the side of the road after he has run out of gas. He has done this with out cars that he has ‘borrowed’ as well.  


6 months ago he was stopped for drunk driving. Luckily he didn’t hurt anyone or himself, but it was a more serious situation because it took him a long while to stop for the cops and that did not play out well for him in court appearances. His court process right now is still ongoing. In the meantime his current car has been modified to have the breathalyzer in it but on his off days he is still stealing/borrowing/using other’s cars so he won’t have to worry about the breathalyzer.  


[Clarification] I am not living in the same house as him. I have my own place. He is still living in the house we grew up in along with 3 of my youngest sisters who are 18, 20, and 22. They all live there rent-free and it is recent that my parents have moved out. They moved out to my mom’s parent’s house on the other side of town because they are both needing help with daily life/activities.  


So he has been able to steal/take/’borrow’ my sister’s cars when they are asleep and he steals their keys and takes the car. Since the stealing and lying about stealing has been going on for years he keeps getting better at covering his tracks or coming up with creative lies as to why he couldn’t have done something or he tried to make it sound like it wasn’t a big deal him taking one of their cars.  


In the recent year or two we have tried to only confront him in person and when we have hard evidence to confront him with about things that he is doing wrong. This **usually** works and he is apologetic and seems remorseful. But just wait another 2 weeks and he does the same things again. My sisters have put locks on their individual rooms, tried to keep their keys with them at all times, etc, but somehow he still just manages to do it.


The last time he took a car was 2 weeks ago, and finally my dad told him if anything like that happens again that he will be put out of the house and/or he will call the cops on him. He is endangering himself and others by taking a car without a breathalyzer with the explicit intent that he will be drinking that night.


Well, tonight he stole my youngest sister’s two newest prescription glasses, cash from her room, and cash from her car (she forgot to lock her bedroom and she was out with other friends who picked her up). My dad did something new (that now we know was a **horrible** idea) he texted him “ if you need money I will lend you money, no problem, but if you want to get kicked out, just keep on stealing stuff”.


He texted my dad back with the expected denial but that “my friend Justin has a gun at his house and I could just go blow my brains out now”. No one was at the house, we were all together hanging out for father’s day. We all panicked. He has never threatened suicide before and it is just cruel that he did. But very serious, and we all rushed home quickly to make sure he was there and not gone.


We don’t know how to help him. We have tried everything from backing off to very confrontational, he is obviously dealing with deeper issues that are causing this behavior in the first place, but we are at our wits end.


Any relationship advice, or advice on how to get him professional help would be greatly appreciated. At this point we are even afraid to send him out or drop him off and rehab type places because we have no radar for what will help him or hurt him more.


We love him very much and we have told him again and again that we don’t hate him and we want to help him but we also want him to stop because it is hurting everyone.

Don't know how to proceed or get him help. What can we do or do better to help him, or give him the help he needs? **Very scared, it is tearing our family apart.**


EDIT: Tried to break up the wall of text

**UPDATE** 9:30AM CT: Called into the local Mayo Clinic to ask about getting connected with a social worker or a psychiatrist, they recommended we talk with him and convince him to go in for therapy/treatment. Like it has been suggested in some comments below--nothing will help or change if he is not willing. Still hurts to hear that because we don't know how he will react at this point, it has been all across the board.  

My dad is going to continue to talk with the social worker in the next day or two and maybe get their help in talking with him or prepping us with how to better confront him without making him more anxious or depressed over the attention. Hoping that he will see that we care about him and just want him to feel better and improve his behavior.","I don't know how to help my brother [M 24], nobody in my family does, help/advice please",0.0,False,10.0,15.0,1434945166.0,/r/relationships/comments/3aoak2/i_dont_know_how_to_help_my_brother_m_24_nobody_in/,NonRomantic

Her mom, my grandmother, died several years back. Then, last month, her best friend died.

Even before her friend's recent passing, ever since my grandmother's death, it is completely impossible to have a conversation with my mom that doesn't eventually, usually within just 15 or 20 minutes, get around to talking about death and anything else depressing one could possibly imagine.

I get that people need to process these things, I really do. But I am not a therapist, I can't sit and listen to my mom sob and describe, in detail, the last moments of my grandmothers life as she sat holding her hand in the hopsital, then get off the phone and go back to work like nothing just happened. 

And I most certainly can't do this over and over and over again. The other day, I brought an old friend over to visit with my mom, and she laid it all on him, too. It was awkward and painful.

12068,Non-Romantic,37awul,"I'm a college student and I'm living with my family at the moment until I get into a comfortable living situation again. From time to time, I'll take the family car and go do errands for my mom -- no big deal. We live in a bit of a bad apartment complex, so the parking lot is often full of junk cars. We have come out to the car many times to find a new mark on it from someone who hit us and sped off. On her way pulling in today, she was pissed, and confronted me about a ding in the rear bumper. When I pushed as to why she thought it was me, she let me know that my brother (henceforth referred to as Jack) suggested it was me, that he sees me pull out and said that I never look behind me as I do it. It was a bit of a kick in the gut to hear that not only was I the first object of suspicion to come out of his mouth, but that he was really trying to sell it by giving her a visualization of a doofus driving the car.

This comes off as petty of me to be so upset, I realize, but let me say in my own defense: I speak from a place of having dealt with Jack on several occasions. This is not the first time he has thrown me under the bus and thought nothing of it. It's also not the first time he's had no problem at all sending some bullshit my way. Through malice or sheer ineptitude, he has given me some serious grief in my life, and every time I try to see the better side of him, it isn't long before I'm given a reason to throw up my barriers again. Thanks to this, I have several bones to pick with him. Some notable instances:

- He has met two of the women I was dating at their respective times, and caused problems between them and I by making things incredibly uncomfortable or just flagrantly disrespecting them without a second thought. When I was going to Basic Training about six years ago, I had an apartment with him; First Girlfriend was living with me as well, to which he consented. When I was gone, he let some random dude he met into the apartment. He made friends with some really sketchy people back then, and the place ended up getting burglarized. I have no doubt in my mind that this guy cased the place. He convinced my brother to give him a key, and Jack gave it to him. Not a word of this was said to me through phone or mail until my girlfriend wrote me an urgent letter telling me as much.

- The apartment that Jack, First Girlfriend, and I were living in at the time was set up with manageable rent and utilities. He told me many times that he had paid the rent, and I assumed everything was fine... until I came to the door one day and saw an eviction notice hanging off the frame. I was scrambling to do damage control, but the eviction happened, sending us our separate ways until I would reunite with him roughly four years later.

- When I was with Second Girlfriend, after a blowout between him and I at one point because he disrespected her, he actually tried to fuck me over by talking shit about me to my girlfriend's mother. She immediately told me what he said; to this day, he does not know that I know. It is worth mentioning that I was giving him and his dog a place to stay while all of this was happening, because he had a severe falling out with the friend he was rooming with, and that friend ended up kicking him out on the street.

- I was to start school using the family car I mentioned, though he had one in storage that needed mild repairs. I ended up having to postpone school because he insisted on using the car to go to a job that was less than a block away. When money would come in, he would use it to buy a new gun, because that's Jack's hobby. It's not until I took matters into my own hands, stopped waiting for him, and started taking the car out that he grudgingly fixed it. Asking him nicely, forcefully, every way I could think of, did nothing at all. His wants came before my needs every time.

Before I get the stock response of communicate with him, talk, say something to him, let it be known: I tried. I've tried hundreds of times to chat with him. To say that he is not a talker is putting it lightly; if a conversation that he does not want to be in continues for more than two minutes, his eyes will glaze over, and he'll make it incredibly clear that he wants the person talking (me) to shut up. He'll turn on his game, start texting, roll his eyes, zone out, et cetera. I've tried to play the diplomat and tell him my side so that we might be able to reach an understanding, and he's just straight up walked out on me while I was talking. At times of extreme anger (the only time I've ever seen him truly get emotional), he's threatened violence against me. That's not something one forgets. Not me, anyway. To disagree is one thing, but to see me as being so low as to be shaken by a threat, and so easily dismissed...

I have been able to have no conversations with him on any of these subjects, because he makes sure to end it before it ever begins, either by making it clear he doesn't give a shit, or by exploding and going for intimidation. It always surprises me how easily he can do this. It always takes me aback because the thing preventing me from doing it to him, doesn't affect him at all.

Redditors. I'm angry writing this and reliving all of the horseshit I've had to deal with, but I'm also speaking from a place of sorrow, because he's my brother and I only get one of him. We are the last sons of our father's line, and I want to have a good relationship with him. Truly, I do. I do not want to have to cut him out of my life. I want to see him as a good person who will be worth knowing in later years. At the behest of my mother, I've chosen not to confront him with what happened today, but that's just one more thing about him that's going to have to go into my filing cabinet.

**tl;dr**: I want very badly to have a good relationship with my older brother. I make effort. However, time and again, just as things are getting good, he does something to really piss me off, or he shows me how little things between us mean to him.

12097,Non-Romantic,2vw8p0,"My friend, Claire, and I have been friends since middle school. In high school, all Claire wanted was a boyfriend; she didn't end up dating at all through our high school years (but hey, I didn't, either!) so she never got that experience. She started dating her first boyfriend, Jack during our sophomore year of college. They dates for almost 3 years, but broke up 6 months ago.


Understandably, Claire was devastated when the break up happened. About 2 months passed and it seemed like she was beginning to heal- she was going out with friends, she got rid of all of his stuff that she'd been hanging onto, and venting more about all of the things that were wrong in the relationship, rather than talking about how much she missed Jack.


Since about mid-November, she's been talking about what her ideal relationship would be. I didn't think anything of it at first and just listened. She mentioned how she follows Audrey Roloff on instagram- she's the wife of one of the son's on Little People, Big World- which I honestly thought was random as hell, but okay. She started talking about how picture perfect Jeremy and Audrey are and how she wants a relationship just like theirs. She started talking about how beautiful Audrey is, how they do this and that, how something romantic happened on the show, and generally gushing over them. Honestly, I wasn't really listening closely because celebrities do not interest me in the least bit... 


She asked me, woulnd't you love to have a relationship like this? and I said no, because we don't know what their relationship is like behind closed doors, and that they looked picture perfect because someone was probably scripting the TV show for them and the Instragram account, for that matter. Me, ever cynical, said that what she saw probably wasn't the couple's reality. 


This pissed her off, and she basically said, No, they're really perfect because on the show [blahblah] and [blahblahblah]. I was getting kind of annoyed at this point and pretty much just said well that's cool I guess and changed the subject. 


Despite this conversation, she brought the Roloff's up to me several times. She sent me screencaps of Instagram posts, talked about the show (I'm not even sure if it's actually on anymore? I'm pretty sure she was talking about reruns...). She started comparing her relationship with Jack to this couple and this is where I decided to say something- I pretty much told her that no matter how it looks, no relationship is perfect and that pictures and TV don't show how a couple really is.


This didn't take. In the past month or so, I'll get a text with a sad emjoi a few times a week from Claire. When I ask what's wrong (even though at this point, I *know* what she's going to say) she sends me a screenshot of Audrey's latest Instagram post and says something like, look how perfect she/they are, no one will ever love me like this. While I want to scream that THEY probably don't have a relationship *like that*, I can tell how badly she's hurting. 


Remember how I said she was starting to heal? Yeah, that's out the window. She's been lethargic, uninterested in doing things other than watching TV, crying a lot more than a few months back. I genuinely don't think it's 100% about Jack, I get the feeling that she has been obsessing over and comparing herself to this celebrity couple so much that she's depressing herself because her relationship wasn't picture perfect; I think she thinks that a truly perfect relationship is the realistic standard, and she's upset because she doesn't think she will ever have a perfect relationship.


I say this because, while I love her, she had really high standards for Jack and it's part of the reason why they broke up. She didn't want him to have very close friends because she wanted to be his best friend. She'd get hurt when he wasn't romantic enough or if he didn't call her to say goodnight *every single night* for *almost 3 years*. She wanted to literally be his entire world, and not in a sweet way, in a kind of scary way. 


Now that they've broken up, I feel that she's latched onto a perfect couple and because she didn't have an idyllic relationship, she feels like she's lesser because she doesn't think that she'll ever be part of a perfect couple. 

How do I help her understand that couples from reality shows aren't perfect just because their PR team make it look like they are, and that all relationships are work and sacrifice, not just perfect and lovey all of the time? Furthermore, how can I help her to see that she shouldn't tie her self worth into having a perfect relationship?

I've always known that (let's call her P) P has struggled with mental health, I knew through-out college as she would be in and out of the doctors and at one point she wound up in the hospital- but laughed it off and made it seemed super trivial so nobody would worry. I didn't know her too well then, so I never questioned. We all knew she had drinking problems though, so much so she was banned on our college trip. But in the end one of us gave her a sip of wine because her anxiety spiked up so bad. Probably the worst thing to do, but it did the trick.

She feels she's a burden to her family, doesn't want to bother them with what's happening with her mainly because she's been in and out of this for years. But it's bad. She will call me or message me when drunk telling me she's crying and she hates herself. I try my hardest to talk to her but this is obviously futile.

**Short Version**


The issue: My grandfather is dying. He has become disabled from his condition and his health has completely deteriorated.
My mother wants me to rebuild my relationship with him (I easily could as he sees nothing wrong with what happened, or is even aware) but I choose not to. She is upset with me because her father is dying, needs family now more than ever, and worries I may regret my choice later in life. I think those are all fair points.


What am I supposed to do? I don't believe all the bad things you've done in your life should be forgiven the moment you're dying or if you're family because we all die and we are all related to someone.  Am I looking at this wrong?


I don't want to get back at my grandfather, I wish him the best but I have no desire to be a part of that. After realizing his character, I am disgusted.  



**Background**


My grandfather was a fairly big part of my childhood (I spent summers at his beach house with my mom, aunt, cousins, and siblings; all major holidays were spent with him; etc). As I grew older I became more aware of another side of him through tension between him and my parents and overhearing stories but I had never seen anything first hand so I never thought too much of it.


Fast forward to the time I'm around 12, my grandfather and his 5th or so wife decide they're going to start an education fund for my brother and I. Our government had implemented a really nice program where they matched contributions and gave very nice tax breaks. 


I started using my account at 19 then took a semester off school when I was 21 (switched from sciences to business and needed a few months to figure things out) and when I returned to school I notified my grandfather and asked to access my account. That was when I found out him and his wife had liquidated my account. And then the accounts of my brother and a few cousins. They had taken over $100,000 between the 6 of us. I was devastated. To be clear: this money was only allowed to be spent on costs associated with education and over half the money was funds from the government matching program and interest. I was screwed.


When my grandfather did this he blamed me for not following through with my education plan, that it was my fault for taking time off, etc. Maybe he was justified but I was not aware of these stipulations and felt these were just bullshit reasons to gain +100% interest and walk away from me. 


While it may seem overly trivial or materialistic to be so upset about money, it made me see him in a different light. Listening to him blame me for him liquidating my education fund sort of 'connected the dots' between every horrible situation in our family that he had been involved in and realizing that he was the cause of each one. He made my mom cry on her birthday, he had let previous wives be atrocious to my mom and say nothing, he had divorced my grandmother and taken every single penny they ever had, he had stopped letting us come to the beach house because his other wife didn't like spending time with us, he had not shown up when my parents bought their first home, and the list just goes on.


I could no longer justify having someone like this in my life ..  it wasn't a conscious decision, my heart just sank every time I looked at him. I still attend family dinners on major holidays at his house but choose not to say much.

12115,Non-Romantic,2ohse3,"I met this friend at our workplace four years ago. I had a crush on her for about a two week period after a work party where a bit of drunken grinding and groping may have occurred on the dancefloor. Apart from that, we've maintained a steady friendship after both leaving that workplace two years ago. Neither of us have held any form of SO in the time we've known each other. We catch up sporadically, sometimes twice a week, sometimes once in a couple of months. As platonic as I try to keep it, I sexualise her every now and then as she's quite attractive and my contact with other females is fairly limited.

A couple of months ago we spontaneously booked cheap flights overseas (her idea) for a 6 day trip, we're sharing a room albeit twin double. As it approaches, I find myself fantasising of situations on the holiday which lead to sex (insert corny porn plots here). Are these just natural male thoughts or will this be unhealthy for my interactions with her? 
  
For what it's worth, one of the last times I travelled with a female companion, it was a similar situation. Although I admitted having feelings for her a few weeks prior, therefore making the holiday infinitely awkward and resulting in fractured friendship post trip. She said afterwards that we could have avoided the horridness of it if we had just aired out our feelings more explicitly prior.

Should I just act as normal as I can and let the next week play out? Should I pull her aside and openly discuss what can and can't occur while abroad? Or am I psychotic for still thinking there's a possibility of this trip becoming a wild sex romp?

12120,Non-Romantic,26ppsz,"Okay, I'm going to try and provide all the necessary background for this, so sorry if it gets long. 


I met Andy almost 8 years ago in my freshman year of high school. We became instant best friends. He's very laid-back, and I have trouble with anxiety, so we were a nice balance. We just clicked. In case anyone is wondering, later in high school we tried dating. We lasted for about 5 months and it was pretty terrible. There is **absolutely no romantic interest at all**. That was about 4 years ago. So, that's not an option. 


Fast forward to my sophomore year of college and I start getting involved in social issues and world news, and realize Andy is kind of a bigot. Not a huge one, but enough to drive me crazy, and was not good at having serious, open minded discussions about topics like that. He's the type of person to be completely set in his ways, but refuse to do any research to either back up or refute his claims. It was very frustrating to me. 


Over time, the little things started to bother me. For example, he would interrupt me *excessively*. It didn't matter when or what I was talking about. I asked him many many times not to, explained calmly why it bothered me, etc., and he just didn't care. Things like that that, and other things, made me feel like he didn't value me as a friend and a person. 


We had planned on going on a trip this summer. I ended up backing out because our friendship had been suffering for almost a year, and I didn't think that would help. He seemed  okay with it, but didn't talk to me for almost a month. Then, when my birthday came and went, it was basically the last straw. I've thrown him huge parties on his birthdays throughout the years and he rarely does anything for mine. Add all the other stuff I had been trying to accept about our friendship, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I messaged him and told him I didn't want to be friends with him anymore. He apologized, and we haven't talked since January. 


Okay so to back up a little bit, he had started dating a girl we'll call Bonnie in September or so. She was very manipulative, would put him in all sorts of weird situations to create drama, would say she wanted to get serious and then flake, that sort of thing. He would ask me for advice, and I would consistently tell him that he should break it off, that he deserved better. 


Well, they started dating officially in January, a couple of weeks before I cut contact. So now, almost 5 months later, his cousin (she and I are friends) texts me and tells me that Bonnie is pregnant, they are keeping it, and are very excited and happy. Now this is a guy who has consistently said he does not want children, so I'm assuming she pushed to keep it and he's along for the ride. 


For quick background, he is 22. He is hopefully still on track to graduate this semester (in a couple of weeks) with a degree in engineering. He moved back in with his parents, and (as far as I know) he has a part time job at a movie theatre. She is not in college, works full time at a bank (she may have graduated with an art degree? I don't remember very well). 


**Finally**, down to my question. What do I do? He was my best friend for 7 years. He drives me crazy but I would do anything for him. He hasn't attempted contact. I even saw him in person a month ago and we didn't even make eye contact. 


Do I text and say Congratulations? Do I text and say I'm here if you need me? Do I not attempt contact at all? I'm really torn. I feel like I understand the pros and cons of both sides, but maybe I'm missing something. I would love some different perspectives on this.

Joe has a son, 3, and a girlfriend, 23. The girlfriend lives with her mum and is raising their son. She is staying over about 15 nights a month with the kid.

Jays daughter is 6 and is over every other weekend. Whenever she isn't over his girlfriend, 24, is over since she lives at home and they can't fuck with her parents around, who disapprove of him. She's over about 20 days a month.

12151,Non-Romantic,2uzvb3,"Hello all, like the title says, I basically just found out something really tragic about an old friend who I've lost touch with. I won't be too specific but it involves suicide and multiple siblings. She was a really good friend to me in high school and I'm just so sad that this happened to her.

First of all, my senior year (when I first met her) I transferred over from another school. This school was much, much bigger than my previous school and making new friends was tough, especially in the senior class because everyone already had their clicks and good friends and didn't really have room for new ones (at least it seemed that way). This girl was not only one of the first people to introduce herself and make conversation with me, but she also introduced me to her friends and her friends became my friends and so on. Without her, I probably would have been really miserable my senior year being alone, but she was nice and thoughtful. 

I'm sad to say that we lost touch shortly after graduation. We went our separate ways and I moved to another city. Anyways, that was like 7 years ago. It's been about a year since I moved back to my hometown (where I met her), but just today I found out about this horrible news.

For her, this tragic event occurred last summer, so still very fresh on her mind. I would really like to reach out to her and extend my condolences. I don't have a Facebook or a Twitter, but we do both have a Google plus account (I'm not sure if she still uses it, her posts are really old). I'm guessing this would be the way to communicate with her, but I' don't know.

My main concerns are, A) maybe its just too early to bring this up. I really don't want to be insensitive or bring this up and maybe she's just starting to get over it. I don't see how me bringing it up or reminding her of it will help. And B) I've just simply never had this happen, where a friend or someone I know faced a great tragedy. I don't really know what to say other than I'm sorry this happened to you and maybe just telling her what a good friend she was to me in high school. 

What do you think? Should I just let it be, not try to contact her at all? Or should I reach out? I really don't know if I was as big a friend to her as she was to me, I hope so, but either way I would like her to know. I realize without context of tragedy, it might be hard to determine but it's really bad. There was even a fundraiser for her and everything. I know that loosing someone is always bad, but the grizzly nature of the situation is just something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

12184,Non-Romantic,229667,"This is news to me. I hadn't known that my mom was apparently suicidal or even depressed. 

As a little background information, my mother and I aren't close. She doesn't, as nicely as can be said, *know me*. That's both her fault and mine. I clamped down on being open and affectionate, I suppose, after some traumatic sexual abuse when I was 10 to when I was 12. (That no one knows about, still.) That joined with my personality, the fact that we've moved state at least ten times (constant leaving of friends), and the fact that she and I are nothing alike has added to the strain. I'm not an affectionate person in general. I don't say I love you randomly and I don't hug. I prefer to show things by actions, as my brother has said, and my blunt honesty can come across as cruel. 

Two days ago my mom, my brother, and I were in the car making a Wal-Mart trip. Simple enough, right? I was in a really good mood. I've been in a nice place and I've been happy lately. As it was, though, I was being a teenager and mentioned that the new internet was slow. My brother agreed. We pointed out that his and my only stipulation for our new place (we moved **again** this month) was that we had fast internet. That's a need, as my school is online. 

We were complaining. Not about her and it wasn't an attack to her. I said that I thought she could have at least asked our opinion of the place before she signed the lease and moved us in. I hadn't even seen the new house and I had ample reason to be upset. We dropped the issue and went inside. Things were nice. She was looking for a vacuum cleaner. 

On the way outside, she and my brother start arguing. I don't really remember what about. It wasn't yelling and it was more of a discussion. She says *and you guys want why I want to kill myself*. That was the first I heard about it. She proceeded to say that it was **our** fault. 

We get to the car and I am angry. I have known suicidal people. My closest friend made a suicide attempt a few years ago. She has since recovered and she's in a healthy place, too. I am defensive about things in that topic because suicide is a very serious thing to me. I was outraged that she would *blame her suicidal thoughts on her children*. That's not a thing you do. I did not put the thoughts in her mind. I did nothing. 

I told her as much. She proceeds to point out my every flaw. Says that I hate her and that I am a horrible person. I tell her that I don't hate her, that I am just not open with affection. That I show her that I care by hanging out with her. I watch T.V. with her all the time. I record things and ask her if she wants to watch. I buy her things. (Just recently I bought her a necklace. I'd have kept it for myself had I know she'd have just put it aside and never worn it.)

She tells me that I never say thank you. I tell her that, in my opinion, I don't like thank yous when it comes to family and close friends. That I don't expect people to show me thanks when I do something for them -- because that shouldn't be the point of it. It's just not me. I also point out that she doesn't thank me, either. 

She continues trying to diagnose me as the worst child in the world. I am in the backseat, so she can't see me, but my brother occasionally looks back. I am not crying. My eyes sting, because as calm as this might seem in writing it was a very charged atmosphere. I wipe any tears before they come. She says I am not nice and that I should change. 

I didn't raise you like this! she yells. I ask her, then, that if she *didn't raise me this way* why am I the way I am? Why am I so cold, so cut off? In my opinion, it's who I am. My life has molded me, yes, but it's also the way I handle things. What? You're like this because your dad died when you were young? Well I didn't have control of that! she yells. It's not my fault! As if that is the problem! I was seven! I barely remember! 

I tell her that's not it. She shouts for me to tell her what the problem is. I go silent. That's not really something I'm going to try to pin point or talk about in the middle of an argument. I've thought of telling her some of the things when I turned 18 before I leave. And I do plan to leave. I want a fresh start somewhere. 

The arguing goes on. I point out that she doesn't know me. That she doesn't try. That I try to tell her about me, try to have her read things that describe me. (I recently discovered the MBTI tests and I scored, multiple times, as INTJ. Even if she doesn't believe in that stuff I think she could have at least listened, because **I** cared about it.) 

I tell her about things I discover, that interest me. She always dismisses it, says that whatever I'm talking about doesn't exist, laughs at me, or just says she doesn't have time. I recently came out to her as asexual, something that I've researched thoroughly and believe actually fits me. I feel comfortable with that. She snorted when I came out and went *no you're not* and then a few seconds later (even though, earlier that week, I had explained what it was) asks *what is that?* and also says *you don't know what that word means*. 

I'll stop ranting now. We came home and I went to my room, locked the door, and played with my cats. She doesn't mention it the next few days and goes on like nothing. That's where we are now. 

I guess any general advice is welcome? How do I understand her better? How do I help her understand me? I don't know what to do. I've thought, multiple times, of telling her I might need a counselor. I have no one to talk to. Now I think she might need one as well. If not for her suicidal thoughts than because her current husband is emotionally abusive. He yells at her and us all the time and very likely has trauma of his own. He has anger issues.

I've never been able to actually bring this up with her, though. If I did, I think she'd just say we didn't have the money or try to bring me to church. I don't want that.

Any advice?

I fully and completely encouraged her to do all of these things and experience that kind of freedom and independence for herself. She deserves it, afterall.

So herein lies the issue... Almost 2 weeks ago she was supposed to go on a canoe trip that we planned out 4 weeks in advance. She made sure her schedule was cleared for that particular weekend and she seemed super excited about it having never gone canoeing before. The weekend before our canoe trip she went to the beach alone as stated above. She went on a couple of Tinder dates while she was there and she and I kept in touch the entire time she was gone since I was a little worried about her being alone with Tinder dudes. So, since she was busy swiping Tinder dudes she came across a guy that she exchanged numbers with but never met. So they continue text messaging each other that week after she leaves the beach. Two days prior to her arrival to my city (we live 4 hours apart) she asks me if she can bring this guy with her (she still has yet to meet him in person). After considering this for a moment I had to decline for a couple of reasons...one being she had never met this guy in person and she is going to bring a stranger into my home. Also, I was short on space at my place since I had 3 other people staying with me for the canoe trip. So I let her know this and she agreed that maybe it wasn't the best idea. All is well, I think.

So, the next day (Thursday) she lets me know that he is going to come into her city and spend the night with her and she will leave the next day to come to my place for the canoe trip. Ok...I'm a little worried about her, but she's an adult. Well, the next day....the day that she is supposed to come see me (haven't seen her since early March), she TEXT MESSAGES me to let me know that she isn't coming and she is going to stay the weekend at her place with this guy. What. The. Fuck. I was seriously crushed. I spent a lot of time planning and accommodating this trip. I haven't seen her, my best fucking friend, since early March. I have spent countless hours on the phone talking her through every emotion she has been feeling over the last several years regarding her POS husband. I have shown genuine happiness for all the challenges that she's overcome in the last year. I've supported tons of weird bullshit and she canceled on me at the last minute for sex with a stranger, basically.

Last night was the first time she and I have spoken since then. She started the conversation with So, I'm sorry.... and I said Yeah? and she said But in all honesty, it was a really great weekend so let me tell you about it.... and then she proceeded to tell me about how he stayed until Monday and yada yada yada before he went back to his state. Ok, fine, whatever. We talked for over an hour about mostly what's going on with her. That's fine too. I get it. She's wrapped up in her shit. I've been there. But am I wrong to be upset a little bit that I didn't get a better apology from her? I've really tried to shake it all day and I'm not getting anywhere. She bitches non-stop about a friend that is notorious for doing exactly this.... Further, I wouldn't be mad AT ALL if she had to cancel for almost any reason other than a stranger from Tinder. I just don't feel appreciated.

I even started dating this girl and still continued to molest him because I am a fucked up piece of shit! Boundaries? What are those? Fast forward to now, he feels really used, hurt, taken advantage of, etc..I absolutely hate that I made him feel this way because he is my best friend and we've had alot of fun together(non-sexually). 

Despite the fact that I care, I do not want to continue hurting him by reminding him of bad times. I promised never to molest him again, but I know it bothers him so much. Also, he is extremely aroused by me, unfortunately, and very depressed. I felt so bad for him that at one point I agreed to have sex with him, but that made everything so much worse! The experience solidified my interest in females and I was very vocal about this and it really hurt him.

I forget to mention that through all of this I am still dating my girlfriend. I digust myself. After the whole experience, he was very sullen and mentioned that he always hated his body and wants a chemical castration. I felt AWFUL. I destroyed this young man's self-esteem and cheated on my girlfriend. I have a feeling that he is in love with me because I have tried to break off the friendship, but he always wants to stay friends. Even though I broke his psyche. 

In truth, I could never reciprocate his feelings. My entire friendship with him made me very sure of my sexuality. You may wonder why I even began to molest him in my youth. Well, when I met him I was quite depressed and teetering on the bi-curious line. So I just used him to make me feel better. I am a fuckass retard. I was never truly attracted to him. He was just...there. I completely objectifyed him, like a cucumber. 

He blames me for alot of things in his life, like having to go to a remedial charter school because of intense depression. He also gets very upset because I am in higher level classes than him. I tell him he shouldn't compete with me and that I would willing to help him work his way up, but he just gets offended.

I am tired of this bullshit. I am an awful friend and he spends too much time and effort on me. I want to quit this. What's the best to let him down?

12210,Non-Romantic,21sieh,"Quick background...I've been divorced to my ex for a few years.  We had a miserable and emotionally abusive relationship, and the moment she left the house she moved in with her boyfriend.  But...I don't care anymore.  I chose not to let hate and anger rule me, and I actually enjoy her boyfriend. He treats my son well, and I wish he had more parenting privileges with him.  Overall this is a very amicable divorce with very few strict rules.  We split time 50/50 with our son, I pay child support, we split all bills, and we are VERY flexible with our schedules.  She wants him for a week for vacation? Sure.  I want him an extra day to take him to a baseball game? Noooo problem.



My ex also is borderline infatuated with my fiance.  Loves her. Probably texts my love more than she does me.  Always talking about parenting, or fancy cooking, or whatever.  But...my ex is very resistant to her being a big part in our son's life.  She refuses to let her to go to school open houses, parent/teacher conferences, or participate in any of the major life decisions. (Basically I discuss it with my fiance, and we come to a mutual decision...then I discuss it with my ex and we come to a mutual decision).  My ex doesn't let her boyfriend (who has a daughter) assist in the raising of our son.  



We've had very few major fights; but always over the same things.  She feels our son needs special education, while the school, myself, my fiance (a special education teacher), and a variety of therapists we have in the family all say it is nonsense. He is excelling in school and has no problems that require spec-ed.  She feels he needs it because he has serious discipline problems at her home--which we have witnessed.  He does not have those problems at our house.  I recently discovered that she actually doesn't discipline him at home (she told us) because she feels guilty about the divorce.  Won't even let her boyfriend, essentially his step-dad, discipline.  I've offered to pay for family therapy, and she has declined.



This all came to a bit of an incident today.  We were spending time with my fiance's family, who he calls Aunt/Uncle/Grandma/Grandpa etc when he decided he didn't want to call my fiance by her first name anymore.   So we pulled up a step-mom blog where they list off a bunch of names and he meshed some together to call her Memaire.  A made up name, but he likes it and so does she.



However my ex-wife heard our son call my fiance that and lost her mine (via text messages).  She is threatening to take me to court, send a letter to the school saying I can't take him out of school tomorrow for our opening day (yay baseball!) tradition, and that I am insulting HER by not forcing our son to call my fiance, his step mother that he loves, by anything other than a first name.  I don't take in to consideration her opinion because I refuse to pay for out-of-school special ed (I actually paid half for almost a year just to shut her up), and that basically we are horrible people for doing this to her.



My fiance is a better person than I am...or ever will be.  She deserves respect.  And I have no overall hate for my ex, and I feel she is a loving mother.  But I refuse to give in on this.  I give in on everything else and this is just so fucking trivial I can't figure out if I'm just being a stubborn asshole, or a doormat.  In the end it would tear me up to tell my son he can't call his step mother anything other than her first name...especially knowing that if I don't, his mother will. Only adding to the confusion.



I just wonder what your thoughts are? Should I just drop this? Is this so small it isn't worth it?

12228,Non-Romantic,207fkz,"So, every since I started my job four months ago I have had several run ins with the same person.


A few things:

-He thinks even mentioning him, be it negative, positive, or neutral, is a personal attack on him.

-He looks for every reason to compare me to past managers and say that I am not qualified for this job and I should quit.

-He constantly sits on his ass and does nothing and refuses to listen to me because I'm half his age and he's been here longer. I also think he has something against women. I've noticed he treats female employees way different than male ones. *Note he is not a manager, his job is to listen to me, he just refuses to do so

-He's always making negative remarks about my physical appearance

-Every time I make even a small mistake he runs to the owner about it even if it's just something small that she has no interest in hearing about

-He has attempted to turn several employees against me


I walk on egg shells around him but even that isn't enough anymore. I've asked several times to no be scheduled with him but the owner, who had told me that every other manager who has worked with him has complained, keeps telling me were so short on staff here that there is really nothing she can do. (Our shifts together consist of us being the only two people in the store for hours at a time) The only advice she gave me was to completely ignore him, which worked until he started pulling me aside and asking my why I was ignoring him (the normal why does everyone here hate me speech he always gives).


About a week ago he pulled me outside and pretty much told me if we were going to be working together we needed to work out whatever was going on. He then went on to blame all our issues on my poor social skills (he and everyone else there knows that I struggled with social anxiety, which has set my social skills back several years). Lately my depression has been hitting hard and I'm in a stage of self loathing so I pretty much agreed with him and said that I would do better.


Yesterday the owner was talking to me and asked how things were working between us and I pretty much explained that he had pointed out what I was doing wrong and I've been doing my best to make it work. Well the owner got angry and started going on about how he was taking advantage of me and I wasn't the one who was wrong and everything. I was off today and I guess she said something to him because all of a sudden my phone started blowing up with texts about how all this was a private matter and I shouldn't have told anyone. Well I had spent the whole day dealing with stressful bullshit (not related to all this), so I just pretty much told him I didn't appreciate him getting my personal number off contact sheet, that is only for real work related things, not settling his petty bullshit, and that we would talk about it tomorrow. I know it was really rude but like I said I wasn't in the mood for any of this today. After thinking for a while I almost called the owner and quit, but I can't do that. I have rent and bills to pay and as someone who lives paycheck to paycheck I don't have a grey area to look for other jobs. Not to mention what I have now is ideal, except of course for him.


Can anyone give me some advice on how to handle this and make things right or keep him from bothering me? I'm really at a loss for what to do.

My neighbor since I was born is trying to sell his house. He has spent a lot of time into renovating his house over the past decade, and his property looks wonderful; it's our house that he feels is going to prevent him from easily finding buyers. Aside from the fact that we might not be the best neighbors in general, the side of our house isn't by any means clean. He was talking to my father the other day about paying me to help him clean up that part of the house.

I find this to be a degrading gesture. I understand his intentions, and assume that he doesn't mean any harm by this notion (when he brought it up to me first hand, he acknowledged that it was a weird gesture, and I didn't respond to that detail, and overall said that I would think about it or have my younger brother do it), but I feel like such a notion is insulting to my father. I don't care to type out the implications, unfortunately.

I was asking my father about what to do regarding this, asking if he is as insulted as I take this gesture to be; he said that he does find it to be degrading as well. I'm on good terms with my neighbor. I'm probably his favorite of the people who live in my house, and he wants to grab my contact information so I can use him as a reference when I finally finish university and start searching for a career (which I want to, because it's just a great thing to have). At any rate, I feel the need to point out to him that it's a bit insulting, and if I help him clean it (or just clean it myself) this weekend, that I would turn down his pay and say I cleaned it because **I** don't like the look of it, even though I would love to run into some money.

Then there are small-yet-related things regarding this that I'm still not entirely sure how to handle. For example, there is a pile of bricks on the side of our house that's just unsightly, and he has apparently hinted at that being removed. I told my father to tell him that he should dispose of it himself, since he wants it removed, but that is an unnecessary remark. I'm assuming the *ideal* thing to say/request/do is for me to help clean the side of the house, but ask that he dispose of the bricks himself, since he wanted them removed and he clearly has the means to do so.

I don't exactly know how to handle this situation, and would just like some help on how to preserve amicable connections whilst saving (my father's) face.

So recently, I reconnected with a friend through facebook (she found me) that was my oldest friend. We are studying in two different countries, both abroad. When she friended me, I thought she would initiate a conversation just to catch up and stuff. She didn't, so I took the initiative to do so. We did catch up, but her replies were very to the point and she did nothing to carry the conversation. When I initiated the conversation I was really excited because I hadn't seen this person in an incredible amount of time, and we were each other's first friends. I was really thrilled to catch up and see what she had been up to all this time and hopefully develop a good friendship out of it. So in that context, her responses kind of threw me off, as she always seemed distracted and not really into it. I don't think there was anything I said that could have offended/upset her in any way, and I'm just trying to get you guys' thoughts on why this could be.

Now, I'm not completely useless because I *do* remember the birthdays of my family members, as well as friends I've known for a very long time. For some good friends whom I've known for a few years, I have to check their Facebook info so I'll remember and we can make plans.

There is one particular friend, Lizzy, who is generally cynical and pessimistic. I love her sense of humor and her loyalty, but she can get quite trying sometimes by questioning people's motives and thinking people are generally up to something. I've noticed that she likes to 'test' her friends and keep score of what they do for her. At her wedding, she kept track of who came, who helped out and who just sat on their ass and complained. Fair enough, I'd notice stuff like that too on my wedding day, but it surprised me just how closely she was paying attention. This has happened for other occasions as well, and she severed ties with her BFF for not being 'concerned' enough about her to ask about how she's doing.

This year, Lizzy secretly removed her birthday on Facebook, so no one received any notifications. I remembered her birthday was in mid-November, but I confused it with another friend whose birthday was on the 20th. So Lizzy's birthday came and went on the 16th, and she was pissed that no one wished her happy birthday or made plans. I apologized profusely, as did our other friends, but she was 'disappointed' in us as she is the type to text people 'Happy birthday!' at midnight. Our group of friends all apologized and are arranging to meet soon for a belated dinner, but we're worried it's gonna be awkward since she's so mad.

While I'm genuinely sorry that I forgot her birthday and mixed it up with someone else's, I'm a little annoyed that she's always doing this 'testing' thing with people. It makes me feel like I have to be on guard all the time and my actions are constantly being appraised and kept score of. Am I wrong to feel this way? Or should I just talk to her and gently tell her that she can't keep 'testing' people because people are human, they're bound to let you down eventually?

I got pretty close with this woman in about October. Initially I was interested in her romantically, but she told me she wasn't interested in anything with me. I'm used to rejection, so it wasn't a big deal. I kept talking to her occasionally and we started to talk about personal issues. It got to the point that whenever I was really bad (I suffer from depression) I would go to her. I felt really comfortable around her and she had a way of helping me get through my worst days. Our relationship pretty much consisted of me forcing us to spend time together though. She was extremely busy because of multiple clubs on campus and never really initiated hang outs, but I knew that she was struggling too so it didn't bother me. I just wanted to be there for her the way she was for me, so I kept up the relationship to make sure that she was doing alright. 

This semester we ended up having a class together and as such started to see each other more often. I pushed for us to have lunch together at least once a week. She started to tell me a lot more about herself. She told me that she didn't really trust men because they all just wanted sex. She'd hooked up with all her guy friends at some point or another, and those relationships always got complicated. I told her that we'd been through that, I knew she wasn't interested, and I wouldn't push for anything more than being friends. After a few very personal conversations she told me that she had been sexually assaulted last year. She also told me that she's been medicating because of depression. At that point it made sense. She always had a new story after weekends about drinking heavily and having some random hook up. We were dealing with the same problems in similar manners, and I felt like at that point we understood each other perfectly. She started to tell me that I reminded her of her brother and even talked about shit from her friend group with me. She really opened up to me, and I was glad to be able to be there for her. 

After one particularly serious episode with depression I started to self harm. I went to her. We talked and afterwards I told her that I loved her (as a friend) and didn't know how I'd have made it through the past year without her. We've both talked about not being able to say that word even with family, so this was a big deal for both of us. Even after this, I was still the one pushing for us to hang out. She didn't really ever text me or set up hang outs. 


**Now onto the current issue.**

She left campus for Spring Break and I stayed to keep working on my thesis. She started texting me out of the blue a few times, which really surprised me. Not really big conversations, but even still this was new. Last Monday I sent her a text offering to pick her up the next day from the train. On Tuesday she said she'd have to take me up on the offer. I picked her up and drove her to her dorm. She mentioned that someone cancelled on her for dinner, and I asked what she was doing for food then. She didn't really have an answer so I took her grocery shopping. We picked up everything she'd need for the week, and then stopped by for some burgers. She mentioned wanting to get high, so we ended up coming to my apartment to make some brownies. We both got really high, and started talking about things. At one point she said she just wanted to be with someone that really cared about her and that she could be intimate with. I obviously told her how much I cared about her because I'm a stupid guy. She said thanks for being honest and changed the subject. We kept talking, and eventually I told her she could spend the night (it was 3 am). She hesitantly agreed, and we got in bed. 

I need to make this clear before the next part: I was really fucking high.

We were in bed together facing each other, and I was rubbing her back with my left arm. After a bit she flipped over so we were spooning (there was space between us). I kept rubbing her back and occasionally moved my arm to her stomach. As I did that she moved her ass really close to me in a manner that I perceived to be sexual. I turned her towards me a little and asked to kiss her. She said it would be weird. I backed off physically. After a while I felt her start to shake. I figured she was having a bad trip, so while on my back I reached across with my left arm and started to rub arm/back. I could feel her arm shaking so I rubbed up and down. I realized that her hand was on her crotch and got really confused. It felt like she was getting off. I put my hand on hers and she pushed it off. I moved away again. She kept shaking and she started to tense up occasionally. She started breathing heavy. I got really fucking confused at this point and I put my hand on her arm again. Her hand was still over her crotch. I moved my hand to her stomach, and she kept shaking. I tried to move it down and she pushed me away again. I moved away from her completely. She kept shaking for a bit and then I fell asleep. 

That morning she got up and got dressed without saying much. I said I was sorry for being pushy last night. She said it was fine. She left. I sent her a text shortly after saying I was really sorry for pushing things after I said I wouldn't and that I didn't want things to be weird between us. She didn't respond. I started to freak out about it throughout the day. I sent her another text that night trying to really apologize and asking if we were ok. She responded saying that this was the reason she couldn't trust people and that she felt unsafe and uncomfortable. 

Since then I have had multiple panic attacks and bad days. Usually she's the person that I'd go to for those situations, but I can't. I started self harming again (not suicidal, just as a method of punishing myself for screwing up). I know I need to give her space right now. That's what she asked for. I'd just like opinions on what I can do once she does tell me she's ready to talk to me again. She is the second person in my life that I've truly loved and cared about, and I don't want to lose her.

**Update**: 

Thanks for all the responses. I'm not going to respond here anymore. I came in here already blaming myself completely for it and some of the responses have (properly) further pushed me to blame myself. I know I fucked up. I'm not reaching out to her, and never would have. I don't honestly know what I wanted from here, but reading through here is making me want to punish myself again and I don't think that's healthy.

I am a 21M Somali.

I was born in USA and live in the UAE. I lived in the US for almost 9 years. I've lived in the UAE ever since. 

A long time ago my dad got married to a second wife in Somalia. (We are Muslim.) They had a daughter. They divorced later. I'll call my half-sister Kamna from here on.

I saw my Kamna once when she was around 5 or 6. (I was probably around 10 or so at the time). Kamna was staying with my family briefly in the UAE. I don't know why. I don't remember much from her visit. All I remember about Kamna was that she was an energetic and cheery 5/6 year old.

This isn't related but I *do* remember a specific incident which I now realize indicated that my mother disliked Kamna. I suppose that means my mom actually wasn't too happy about my dad's other marriage. 

Since then her mother remarried (I think). Their family emigrated from Somalia to Holland.

Since then I completely forgot about her. It's been 11 years and I've almost never thought of her in that time. Once in my preteen years I was counting my family members and my father reminded me that I have a half-sister. There was a time my younger sister mentioned stopping by to see Kamna when she visited Holland. Not many other times that I even thought of her. I was going through old /r/relationships stories when I thought wait a minute....I also have a half-sibling.

Thanks to those stories I'm now interested and apprehensive about contacting her. She *does* have a separate family and maybe they won't be happy about the intrusion?  I suspect my mom wouldn't like it, not that she needs to know. I also have no clue what Kamna's feelings towards my dad or my family might be.

Also using her full name is there anyway to find her apart from facebook? She lives in Holland. I could ask my sister for more information but I'd rather not right now.

12304,Non-Romantic,31el55,"I am not quite sure where to start. I feel extremely upset and scared and sorry if something does not make sense but here goes..

My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We were together for a year in my senior year of high school and continued dating as he went off to university. Currently, we are in different countries as I finish high school. For university, I am not going to the same place as him unfortunately but I will be able to visit him a lot more than I can now. I have not seen him in person since last summer. Our long distance is not really the problem as we make it work really well. We talk everyday for hours.

He has had a strange relationship with his parents. They did not treat him the best back in high school but now that they are living separately, they have become closer. 

For Easter weekend, he was visiting his parents in their home state when his mother randomly came up to him and told him, out of nowhere, that years ago, when my BF was younger, she cheated on her husband with a man and she just found out she has AIDS. She said it just like that, extremely abruptly, and then told him never to tell anyone. 

Of course, this was a huge shock to my BF, who literally did not know what to say. He went and threw up in the mall bathroom but had to act normal around his father and siblings. (He has six younger siblings and he is the oldest). 

He called me in tears that night and told me all of this. He said that his whole life seems like it has been a lie because his own mother would do something like that to his father. He also felt terrible because he has memories of a man being home when his father was at work when he was younger and his mother always telling him (my BF) to go away and leave her alone when this man was over. Also, his parents are very very religious and it was extremely hard for them to accept me as his girlfriend. Those memories made the situation worse as my BF kept remembering how his mother would give him religious lectures even though she had done something like that. 

I had no idea what to do to comfort him. I just kept saying I'm so sorry until he fell asleep and I feel terrible. I have never known anything like this to happen to people I actually know or met and love and I know he must be feeling so much worse than me. I can't even imagine what he feels. I just wish I was there for him in person so I could at least hold him.

He has two more days to spend at his parent's house and it is horrible because he has to keep this secret will hanging out with his whole family and his father. I asked him if his father knew and he said no, and he hoped he never found out. His father would divorce his mother immediately and my BF is scared about what would happen to his younger siblings. His mother does not work.

Also, and I know this just sounds like a bad TV show at this point and I truly wish it was just a TV show, his mother is pregnant again and due in November. 

I was reading about AIDS when he fell asleep as I do not really know much about it and I read that she could pass it on to her newborn and this scared me a lot so I sent my BF a message about that so he can read it when he comes online. 

Also, his father would have it too right? Isn't it impossible for his father to never find out? And I am so sorry if this is a dumb question but his mother could not have in anyways passed it to him (my BF) right? I am sorry if it is stupid but my school never had sex ed and my parents don't really talk about this kind of thing so I am lost and confused. 

How do I comfort my boyfriend? What can I even tell him? How do I reply when he tells me all this? And what can he do? Should he tell his father? We are both so distraught and scared and any advice would be extremely helpful as we have never been in this situation before. I apologize if it seems like I am worming my way into his problem but he has nobody else to talk to and I want to help him as much as he can.

--------

Anyways, yesterday I received a message from a long time friend which said something along the lines of Fuck you actually for ever telling me your feelings.  It's fucking up my relationship and I don't need that.

To context this a little bit, we were very close 5ish years ago, I almost asked her out but didn't go ahead with it. She moved away for a year very shortly after so I never got a chance to really moved forward with it (didn't want to do a long distance thing). Soon after I met my current girlfriend and have been very happily together with her for 4+ years. My friend moved back to my city and met a guy (who happens to be one of my many cousins), they've been together for 3 years? Something like that.

Her and myself have kept in contact since then, not very often, and more so in the last 6-8 months, having a short conversation on facebook once or twice a month. Sometime around the end of November we got to talking about how close we were back in the past, I brought up how I almost asked her out and she was surprised and said she would've said yes. I mentioned that damn I should have! But I'm very happy with where we are now, and that we're still friendly. Now back to the present day and I receive this message from her. I believe it to be in regards to what I told her back in November, but I have no idea.

Now I wanted to message her back and talk to her about this, but she deleted her Facebook account. I was talking to one of her best friends about all of this and she mentioned that her and her fiancé are having some troubles, and that it probably doesn't totally concern me. She mentioned that my cousin had seen the messages I sent, and he wasn't impressed. 

Oddly enough I was talking to him in person this last weekend and all seemed to be fine. I talked to her last in Febuary and everything was great, we talked plenty between November and then as well...

I guess my question is, what should I do? I don't mean any harm and I want to solve this issue with everyone being happy. I'm not used to this drama haha.. I will say, completely out of context, that under the right circumstances, (us both being single) I would definitely ask her out, but I'd be much happier if she was with my cousin, hes an awesome dude.

Am I just taking a hit for some of their relationship issues?

I am currently a grad student in accounting, originally from Upstate NY, but now at a school in Indiana.  For the past several years, I have wanted to move to Los Angeles, for a few reasons, but mostly because my dream company and industry is located there.  I have expressed this to my parents (they have generally always been very supportive, but extremely practical as well) and until this weekend, they have tried to give me reasons why I shouldn't go, but didn't push too hard.

This past week, I received a job offer in LA (Big 4 accounting firm, decent pay), and my parents came up to school to visit.  Once they arrived, the job offer immediately came up in conversation, and they started throwing reasons at me left and right on why my moving there is a terrible idea.  They didn't seem to understand that this is something that I have thought about for a long time and always wanted to do.  They even went as far as to try to guilt me out of it (your grandparents are going to die soon, you can't miss the funeral, etc.), but I told them that I know this is what I want to do.  It got to the point where my mother, who is normally not very emotional, started to cry, which killed me to see.

I have always had sort of a guilty conscience, and never really rebelled against my parents.  They are doing their best to try to guilt me into not moving away, but I know that this is something that I really want to do, and have thought through thoroughly.  I just don't know how to express that to them, and avoid hurting our relationship.  I love my parents more than anything, but I need to be able to live my life without them guilting me into doing what they want.

I'm just in a difficult position because I want to be there for him but he constantly 'gets to me' and causes me much unneeded grief and frustration. I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells when I'm with him and I really just have to allow him to dominate every interaction or conversation. If I have anything to say- he knows better. If I suggest a different view point-his reaction shows it's a personal attack on him. If I do something he wouldn't do- he will force his viewpoint on me as if it's the absolute perspective to have and I'm a little idiot for not realising that. But all things said and done, these are not problems he has directly with me. Perhaps they are accelerated due to our relationship growing up and the fact he really was my big brother who felt compelled to be 'bigger' in the past. But we're grown ups now. A friend once advised me that, regardless if I want to just be there for my sibling, I need to 'protect myself' from them.

So I have a very close friend that I'm in a spat with. Honestly, you should probably just TL;DR this sucker because it's so petty. Actually, that's part of the problem.

So I've known this girl forever (~20 years). She's best friends with my girl who is the same age as me.

Here's the issue: she's a tiny little lady who had serious weight issues for a long time and has a bit of a persecution complex.

In the past, she's gone on bratty rants. One time, on her Birthday, on the ride home, when all of her closest friends were there, and we all worked the next day and needed to end it at 11, she yelled at us. Fuck you guys. More than once. We all get drunk. I get it. But that's only one instance.

She falls for the most handsome dudes around and then tasks us with handling her emotional fallout. She was just in the psych ward (first time) and we were there every day. It was over a dude who was very clear that he wasn't seriously interested in her. Apparently, they had lots of crazy monkey sex.

She's really great in many ways, too. I just... anyway...

We play in a band together. It's been really fun. The other night, we had a show and she didn't want to help move the gear. That sucks but could've been fine. She was going off on me on the phone about how she had to go to her fucking therapist and how this was all bullshit, etc.

What the hell do you do? This is one of my oldest friends. She's been through hell. But she told my lady that she's not going to apologize. That's all it would take for me to drop this whole thing but it's been a pattern with her. It feels so silly but I'm putting my foot down this time.

12359,Non-Romantic,36o5fa,"I moved from Europe to Canada a few years ago and found the first year tough as it was very different socially. The Canadian city I live in has a reputation for being difficult to meet people/make friends, but I didn't think it would affect me. 

I quickly found that my prior way of making friends and getting to know people (i.e. talking to and spending time with) didn’t seem to work well here. 


In Europe, I liked time with friends/people, time by myself and was pretty good at balancing the two (turns out I’m an “introvert”!). I didn't have difficulty getting to know people and it seemed that people were genuinely interested in getting to know me too. People weren't suspicious of strangers or as cliquey as they seem to be here. In short I was happy with my social life and friend circle.


In Canada, If I met someone who I got on well with, there was lots of “lets grab a of coffee” or “we should hang out” which I took as encouraging signs. Numerous incidences of me reaching out to follow up on their comments resulted in people saying yes but flaking out last minute or standing me up. So I got a little blasé about making numerous efforts with people I’d just met which didn't seem to go anywhere. 


Over time I did click and become friends with 2 or 3 people. For the first few years in Canada I had a small number of friends, mainly individuals rather than a group that all knew each other, and a number of acquaintances. Things were good. 

The three friends I was closest to moved away over the course of 2013 and gradually I noticed that my social life got very quiet. Efforts to reconnect with or attend events with acquaintances failed (usually via no response or flakiness from them). 

2014 was a tough year that had family deaths and illness, personal illness, turmoil in my relationship and 3 months of unemployment and resulting stress about finances. I didn't have any close friends that I could talk to about what was happening and didn’t feel safe to share it with the people that I knew casually. 

As I was dealing with a lot of stuff, I didn’t have tonnes of social energy or inclination to meet new people as I felt I couldn’t be vulnerable/authentic/honest about where I was at without the risk of people perceiving me as a moaner or someone who has tonnes of issues (I don’t). Basically 2014 kicked my ass and I started going to counselling as I needed support.

Counselling was fantastic for getting perspective and clarity. As part of my self-work, I set some realistic goals for 2015 where I decided to try again, to not be blasé and to renew my efforts socially to meet new people. That being said i hold my hands up and say I have been guilty of periods of radio silence on occasion when life gets busy and I don’t have the social energy. I usually communicate this if that is the case.


So I’m now 5 months into the year, have hit a brick wall and am feeling really lonely. I’m not shy, have no difficulty talking to folks and invited people to events; extended invites to casually hang/go for a walk and tried to make coffee plans. 

In the past 4 weeks alone I’ve made efforts to connect with 3 individuals that I’ve liked and hung out with a bit, all three gave the “yes would be great to hang out” spiel but all have flaked by not responding when I propose date options that work for me and ask what works from them. 

Currently i've been feeling less likely to reach out to people mainly because i got tired of months of we should hang out!, followed by proposal of date options and then nothing. 

I don’t want to be a back burner option and treat people’s time as i want people to treat mine - with care and consideration. I’m generally an open, perceptive person and am at the point where i can't understand what i'm doing wrong. Am i doing something wrong? Is it a case of I’m not picking up on some not so subtle social hints that people aren’t interested in getting to know me? My interests are not team or group based and 1:1 conversations are preferred so going to meet ups doesn't seem like the smartest option.

I understand that people are busy, have their own lives but am also approaching the point where i'm don’t want to offer time or energy to people who don't add funds to the mutual friendship kitty (so to speak).

Got any ideas why? Maybe someone knocked some sense into her? Or she suddenly realized how ridiculous she was being? (which I sincerely doubt). What do I say to that? I thought of just going 'I spent quite a bit of time with you lately, even neglecting my own hobbies, and hardly got to see said friend, so I'm going on this trip with her because I wanted to have some fun with her...' or something along those lines, enforcing the fact that she's coming with me because I wanted to hang with her and wasn't able to for a while, as well as enforcing the fact that we spend a lot of time together so she shouldn't mind.

I don't want to not have any parents there for my wedding. They both seem very set in their decisions.

12385,Non-Romantic,2tjuiz,"I expect I'll just sound like some kind of annoying, disrespectful teenage girl, but here goes - all replies are greatly appreciated.

I was speaking to my mum yesterday evening about an argument we'd been having earlier on. She was saying how the house (which I have lived in since birth) was *her house* and that I should be respectful of what I did and said to her in *her house*. I was okay with that, especially when she added that my room was my personal space. 

I then, jokingly, asked if (when I was 16) I could take boys into my room - my implication was for sex, as by that time I would be legal and she'd said before to me that if I was to do anything with boys I'd *have* to be 16 and in a relationship. She said no, and seemed kinda shocked that I'd asked that.

She then proceeded to inform me that I was never going to have sex in *her house* so I pointed out that as I would be legal there would be nothing she could do about it. Wrong. She threatened that she'd phone up the boys' parents about my behavior if I didn't abide by her rules.

I don't know why but I was quite pissed off. I want to know if you guys think she was being unreasonable: many of my friends have started having sex, and even those who aren't, their parents would be pretty cool with it. Also, I don't think phoning my future boyfriends' parents would help as, like I said, most of my friends' parents are fine with sex (and by sex I'm including sexual contact) at their house. So, either way, I can still most likely sleep/whatever with these guys anyway - just not at my house. 

Above all, the whole situation irritates me because when someone of the male gender is in my bedroom alone, we're *not necessarily having sex*. I don't want to be pushed into the lounge just because I have uptight parents who not only won't accept any sort of sexual relationships with guys at my age, or even for any of my male friends to come into my room alone.

12386,Non-Romantic,25ufmd,"Here is a good example: The other day we were driving with some other friends to a park and we drove past a drive-thru Beer Mart. I think those things are the stupidest idea - basically encouraging people to drink and drive. So in the car, I voiced my opinion about the drive-thru Beer Mart and my friend got really defensive about it. Basically, she acted like I had offended her with my opinion of the store because she has many of those where she grew up in Indiana. Apparently insulting the store was like insulting her. I didnt know that about where she grew up, nor did I direct the comment to her. I was just thinking out loud and did not mean any harm.


Another example: We were joking about rednecks and I mentioned that a stereotypical redneck thing to do is watch NASCAR. She got offended and said that since she watches NASCAR that I was calling her a redneck. First of all, I never directed the comment toward her. Second, I have never seen her watch or talk about NASCAR and it doesn't seem accurate for her to say that she watches it. Nor is she anything like a redneck. She's from a wealthier suburb for cryin out loud.


Now, to be fair, when I say these comments, I can sometimes come across as a know-it-all, like I'm stating fact instead of just my opinion. Maybe it's just the way I say it that irks her. I've noticed that she tends to be bossy, competitive, a little immature, likes to be right all the time, and have the last word. I've considered the idea that she may see me as a threat to her ego or whatever, especially bc im older. As a result, I've tried really hard to not sound so know-it-all and will consciously give her the last word in these situations because I dont care about being right or wrong. I'd rather her feel like she won than get into a lenghty argument about things.


The last time we talked about this, it didnt go so well. I brought up the conversation and I told her that I think she gets offended too easily. I apologized for upsetting her and reassured her that I didnt mean to offend her. But, I told her it seemed like no matter what my opinion, it would somehow offend her. I told her im worried I cant be open with her because she is always getting offended. Well, it didnt go well. She once again got offended and angry at me, saying that she doesnt get offended that frequently and that Im just overblowing things. We havent talked in a week and a half and Im worried we're drifting apart.


I wish there was something I could do to change my behavior so she wouldn't get so offended all the time. I dont want to stop voicing my opinion, because what friendship would that be? But I also want her to know I'm not trying to attack her. 


Am I being fair about this? Or am I actually really messing something up here?

12388,Non-Romantic,2qq08s,"A bit of background info: 
My parents split up 2.5 years ago after a 24-year marriage. I very actively kept myself out of the ensuing legal battles, as I felt that it was absolutely none of my business. However, my mother fell back into her history of mental health issues and was furious with me for not intervening. It put a lot of stress on our relationship, as she would call me a bitch, threaten to disown me, tell me she wished she'd never had me etc. Though I worked very hard to improve our relationship again, and it has, because of the strained history she will simply stop talking with me whenever I confront her with small things that I feel she has done wrong. I live abroad from her, so that means that she will simply not reply to my emails and messages for a month or so.

Anyway, my mother was mostly furious about her prospective financial instability, which always surprised me because a. Alimonies. b. She has a job that pays her an above average amount. 

When my parents recently entered into a 3rd law suit against each other, I voiced my surprise about my mother's worries to my father. He then echoed that surprise and revealed that my mother had withdrawn over 100.000 euros in cash from their joint bank accounts over the last 7 years. Only 25.000 of that can be accounted for, the rest has mysteriously disappeared. He only discovered this after the divorce, when he started doing his own finances instead of my mother, who used to work in banking and therefore was much more skilled at it.

He showed me the bank statements and his calculations, so I know for sure that this is true.

**TL;DR: Dad is having a son with his 2nd wife. My half-brother will be nearly 30 years younger than me and raised in another country. They both know my husband and I are childfree, I'm not comfortable around kids and refuse to baby sit, but make demands like I convert our guest room to be a bedroom for my half-brother and that I fly over to see them and baby sit every month. They also expect me to instantly have a really close relationship with my half-brother and seem to think seeing him will make my husband and I change our minds about having kids. I want to know my half-brother, but on my own terms and in a way I'm comfortable with. I lay down the law for dad and his wife. In his reply, he called me immature and selfish and tells me I need to get over my spoiled, only-child mentality and put in some effort.**

*Disclaimer: My husband (31M) and I are childfree. While he's great with them, I'm really not any good at interacting with kids and don't really like them much, especially babies and toddlers. They make me very uncomfortable because I find them so unpredictable. I have tattoos, piercings and glasses which makes most young kids grabby around me, and being exposed to the excess of bodily fluids that seems to come with interacting with a toddler (drool, snot, etc.) make my skin crawl. Most kids pick up on how uncomfortable I am and that makes them uncomfortable, resulting in a lot of kids crying around me no matter what I do/don't do. My parents have known since I was in my early teens that I don't want kids and that I don't like them much, so this isn't a new, ground breaking revelation for my dad.*

OK, so, mum and dad always wanted 2 kids, and dad especially wanted a son. Being pregnant with me was really rough on mum though, to the extent that she was bedridden for the last 4 months of her pregnancy, ended up having to have a c-section, and her body has never recovered (28 years later and she still has back problems, hip problems, bladder problems, etc). She wasn't sure she wanted to go through that again and just over a year after I was born, she was confirmed to have started menopause, so the choice was taken away from them. They considered adoption, but it wasn't a realistic option due to finances and us having to move around a lot for my dad's work, including moving overseas a couple of times.

Despite not being the boy dad wanted, he was an amazing father and never made me feel unloved or like I was second to his metaphorical male child. He would let me do make overs on him complete with bright red lipstick and electric blue eye shadow, he played Barbies with me, he endured injuries that sent him to hospital for me (broken toes from tripping at the park while playing tag, an accidental roundhouse kick to the face and a slipped disk while holding my punching bag steady while I was practising Tae Kwon Do, etc) and if I wanted to play princess dress up, he made sure he was the prettiest damn 6' 3, moustachioed princess that ever wore a ball gown made of floral bed sheets.

Fast-forward to last month, he and my mum have been divorced for 5 years, he's married a woman the same age as my husband (that's a whole separate level of weird for me, especially when he calls her my step-mother, but I won't go into that here) and he tells me his wife is 5 months pregnant with a son. They live overseas and he wanted to tell me in person but wasn't able to get over to Australia before then, which is why I didn't know about my impending half-brother sooner. I'm happy that he and his wife are happy, but privately I'm questioning how he's going to keep up with a kid in his mid to late 60s, especially considering he's morbidly obese, going to need a knee reconstruction within the next 5 years, and he's recently been diagnosed with fatty liver. I really don't think he's thought it through completely and has either chosen to ignore or completely forgotten the fact that a kid is a lot of work and he isn't in his late 30s any more like he was with me.

Anyway, dinner with him that night went fine, and then later that week the emails started. He and his wife were making comments about how I was going to baby sit, how I was going to want a kid after holding my newborn half brother, how I was going to essentially fly over every month and help raise my half-brother and have a super mega close relationship with him in every email. I was sitting there thinking *They don't actually expect this stuff, right? They have to be joking.* because they know I'm not good with kids, they know my husband and I don't want kids, I don't trust myself to baby sit, and I've literally dropped a baby. I do not hold babies. My family tease each other a lot as well, so I was really, really hoping the lack of tone in emails was causing me to miss the punch line.

At first I laughed it off making Oh! You're funny! You should be a comedian! kind of replies, but they kept making comments. I then asked them to please stop, but they kept making comments. Their expectations became more and more outrageous and impractical for me and when my dad told (not asked, *told*) me that I have to convert our guest bedroom into my half-brother's Australian bedroom, I was pretty blunt with him and sent the following in an email to him:

I've asked you nicely to stop making demands regarding my half-brother, but you haven't. I feel they've gotten out of hand and I have to lay some ground rules.

1) Husband and I are childfree. Seeing a newborn does not change our stance on that no matter who's child it is. Please don't presume to tell us that we do or do not want. We've seen newborns before and still don't want kids.

2) Our home and our pets are not equipped to handle children. We have a dog with anxiety, a bitchy and at times very aggressive cat, a snake enclosure at toddler head height, stairs with no child safety gates, expensive consoles, computer equipment and collectables within easy kid reach, a honking big sword on the wall, and that's only stuff I can see from my couch. Our nephews do not come into our home without their parents to watch them because it's not safe for them, and neither will my half-brother.

3) I won't be flying over to see you all at the drop of a hat when it's convenient for you. I have my own life and responsibilities. Even if I was willing to shirk my responsibilities for this, I simply can't afford to.

4) We have a guest room. It will be staying as a neutral guest room, for any guests we allow to stay here overnight. Depending on how well mannered my half brother is, he may or may not be on that guest list, but I can guarantee that he won't be on it until he is at least 10 years old.

*Edit: some clarification on this point: I meant that he can't stay over totally and 100% in my and my husband's care until he's 10. I thought this was kind of obvious by my 2nd point (Our nephews do not come into our home without their parents to watch them because it's not safe for them, and neither will my half-brother.) but apparently I was wrong. I did write this when I was kind of upset so I can see now how it might not be obvious.*

*If I feel comfortable with him staying here when he's younger, he can. He can come over for a short visit before he's 10 as long as our dad or his mum are here looking after him, but younger than that he can't stay over without them here to care for him. I don't trust myself to care for a child. Also, we don't have room for more than 1 person to stay over at a time so I know dad and his wife wouldn't be able to stay the night here with him no matter his age. /edit*

5) Don't demand I help raise or have a close relationship with my half-brother when he'll be nearly 3 decades younger than me and being raised in another country. If you lived within driving distance, I could understand your expectations, but saying that I'll have to fly to another country to help with him and see him every month is ridiculous. Yes, we're going to be biologically related, but as you both know from dad's relationship with his brothers, that guarantees nothing*. 

**Dad has two older brothers. One he's really close with, the other he hasn't talked to in nearly 10 years.*

My dad's reply:

Well done, you made your step-mother cry. Stop being so damn selfish. You need to let go of your spoiled, only-child mentality and put in some effort to be part of your BROTHER'S life. You need to step up and be his big sister and help guide him through life. It's what older siblings do. Time for you to take on some real responsibility. I'll talk to you again when you've grown up.

I got that a couple of hours ago. I've talked to a couple of friends on facebook chat while I've been typing this post out and told them about it and they all seem to think dad is totally out of line. I trust them and they aren't the kind of people to say what you want to hear, if they thought I was in the wrong, they'd call me out on it. They also know me really well so my personality and what they know of me might be influencing their opinion on the situation.

The only child comment was weird to me because I honestly don't care that I won't technically be an only child any more. I'm not 3 years old competing with a new sibling for mummy and daddy's attention. I don't see my half-brother as some kind of usurper of my father's love an affection. As it stands now, I see my dad once, maybe twice a year. I'm also old enough to know that kids are a LOT of work so I wouldn't begrudge my dad not being able to jump on an international flight and see me for a couple of years because he's busy with his much younger, non-adult child. If I was jealous of my half-brother for this, I'd either be totally ashamed and embarrassed by my immaturity or booking an appointment with a psychiatrist to get my narcissism officially diagnosed.

On one hand, I'm like Well fucking duh I'm gonna be part of his life because I actually want to be there for my half-brother. I want to get him gifts for his birthday and Christmas, I want him to know as he's growing up that he can come to me for anything, be it help or just to hang out, and I'll do what I can. I want to introduce him to Pokemon and the Foo Fighters and fantasy books and all the stuff I'm into so he might end up having some interests that correlate with my own and we can relate on more levels than just genetic. I want to be a part of his life, but I want it to be on my terms.

On the other hand, I think dad's expectations and demands are completely unreasonable considering the circumstances. Like I said to him, if he and his wife lived within driving distance from me, then yeah, I could totally understand (not the guest room thing though, that seems way too far).

I've never knew it was possible to feel guilty, enraged, disrespected and confused at the same time.

From an outside perspective, am I being unreasonable?

At one point I sent an email, but changed my signature to say Beaker instead of my real name. A few weeks later I went so far as to change my ringtone to Mi-mi MEE Mi-mi-mi! When my coworkers found out about it, they thought it was HILARIOUS. They'd start teasing me by making meep noises when I spoke. All in good fun, of course. Eventually, I called T-mobile and had them change my caller ID to say Beaker. Then I called my boss. He flipped out. It was hilarious. Everybody loved it. 

And apparently there's now a pool going on. They want me to get a Beaker tattoo on my neck. This was on Thursday. We decided Beaker on one side and Meep! on the other would be best.

It would be the funniest thing ever when I walked into the building with Beaker printed on my neck. 

But THEN, on Friday, before I'd had a chance to get henna'ed, they brought it up. They said they had expected me to walk in that morning with some kind of temporary tattoo on my neck. Hell, one of them even specifically mentioned henna. So now I am at a loss. I don't know where to go from here. If I don't get the henna, the joke dies. If I do, it'll seem like I'm just doing it because they said to. since they suggested it, they destroyed the originality of the idea.

Because he's one real ass antisocial guy, or at least from what I've seen over the years (also, I had to literally pull him into my friend group way back in middle school when he was alone everyday).

Even back at high school when I used to talk to my classmates and other small friends, he felt very out of place and even when I tried to pull him into the conversation he just used to flare up and declare he didn't know anything at all about what we were talking about (including science stuff). I guess I sort of swept all that under the rug back then and moved on too easily and didn't even attempt to talk about it with him (not a fan of confrontation with friends) so I'd say it is my fault to a certain degree. And now it's sort of biting me in the ass I guess. 


What I want to know is, how exactly would I approach the topic next time and tell him that I have no interest in meeting up with him during college lunch? I don't want to leave this guy completely, and yet I don't want to push away my new friends at all (they're really fucking awesome). So think you can help a brothuh out?

I asked her what happened and she got really angry and told me it was nothing, then changed the subject. That was about 2 weeks ago. Yesterday I saw fresher cuts on her arms, and again I asked her what happened and she gave me the same response. 

I am really worried because there were a few occasions where she was frustrated with schoolwork and started talking about how useless she was and how she wanted to die. I also have had emotional issues for the past few years and have also talked down on myself, and at the time I didn't realize how I could have influenced her. I feel horribly guilty now at the thought I might have contributed to whatever is going on with my sister.

During this last year, I suffered from a serious neurological problem that made me act irrational, have mood swings, sleepwalk, etc. I felt like Louis was the only one there for me through the whole process of diagnosis and treatment, even when I was acting completely crazy.

Five years ago I had a very rough time with unemployment. I was in a job I hated. I quit. Had visa issues, decided to change careers and was out of work for 16 months.

During that, very difficult time, I was pretty secretive about what I was doing out of shame and just the difficulty of at all. It wasn't something I wanted to discuss at parties.

Finally, I got a break in a new field and it's been great ever since. I've progressed quickly from entry level to better and better jobs and now I'm on my highest salary ever. I'm very successful.

But every time I meet M she keeps harking back to the hard times. She asks lots of intrusive questions about my jobs (exact contract conditions, why did I leave the last place, were they happy with me?, is this a better job?). I find it very rude and inappropriate.

It's like she saw me at my weakest, and was actively unhelpful, and as I have recovered and gone from strength to strength she constantly wants to remind me of the past.

12501,Non-Romantic,3et1wb,"So I have this friend, let us call her Rachel. Now, Rachel and I have been friends since I was in my late teens. I was this weird sad-sack kid with no fashion sense or social skills and Rachel, the glamorous artsy newly-married older (than me) woman, kind of took charge of making me over one summer when I was visiting some relatives of hers (old family friends.) Since then I've spent a week or two with her every summer---she lives in a different state than I do---and we communicate on facebook the rest of the year. Since our friendship began, I've grown up and she's become a mom...we've both matured and changed a bit since the early days of our friendship. Anyway. I'm casual friends/facebook friends with a lot of Rachel's social circle (like I said, some of her relatives are old family friends, so their community is a bit known to me/my family.) Some of them are my good friends. So I know a bit about what goes on in their lives, and when I visit Rachel I usually get to see/catch up with them. Rachel also catches me up by filling in the details of what's been going on with everyone, because she's obviously closer at hand to these folks than I am and knows their day-to-day better than me. 

But the problem is that sometimes Rachel also says unkind things about these people, and even about people I don't know, to me. She also sometimes makes kind of judgmental speculations about them, including about things that I really don't think are either of our business. I don't like hearing her gossip badly about people, especially people I know and care about, and I certainly don't think it's fair or very honest to talk terribly about people when they aren't around and then act nice and friendly on the occasions when you see them. It's even against our religion to go around talking badly about people behind their backs, and I was brought up to believe that while everyone slips up sometimes, and sometimes venting is okay provided you don't spread the venting around, it's very bad behavior to *constantly* talk badly about people. And especially when those people are supposed to be your friends.

I guess it never really sunk in how much Rachel does this until my most recent visit. It really stuck out to me and I was kind of shocked. I don't know if I just never noticed it before or if she just didn't do it as much, but this time she did it almost every day at some point. I want to say something to her about it (not over facebook, but maybe next time we see each other in person), but I think she still sees me as the immature weird kid who is supposed to be guided by her, not call her out on something. We had a disagreement on something else while I was there and I realized that she still thinks I'm a sheltered person with no real understanding of how the world and people work. (Plus I'm single and childless and I don't think she views unmarried people or people without kids as if they were quite as grown-up as married people with kids, especially women...she is quite traditional and old-fashioned in some senses.)

 I should also mention that Rachel is a very emotion-driven person, who tends to react first and consider what was actually said later, and that she can get very upset if she thinks she's being attacked or criticized (no matter how kindly), even if she eventually comes around to admitting that the criticism was accurate. I'm dead certain no one has ever called her out on this gossiping thing in her *life;* it's possible she doesn't even realize how unpleasant or constant it is. But I really don't like it and I also feel uneasy when I think about the fact that she probably talks about ME behind my back, too...she does it to just about everyone else she knows, so it's really unlikely I'm the only one who gets away without it. I just don't know how to approach the subject with her, nor do I know how to get around her seeing me as the silly young sad-sack who needs to be looked after and told how things work.

12519,Non-Romantic,2n5h38,"Hi Reddit,

I'm not really sure why I'm posting here, I think I just need an outside perspective for a sanity check on my thinking. 

I am 22 years old, college educated, an engineer in a stable job making over 60K, and I live with my parents. My family is Eastern European and being the only girl in the family, that means that I do the majority of the cooking and cleaning around the house. It is my place as a girl to do so. My mom is also sick. Very sick. So she can't fulfill the role that is commonly filled by the wife/mother in a very traditional household (cooking and cleaning for the family). My parents are fundamental Christians.

I've never had a problem helping my family out, of course it sucked coming home from the 4th grade and having to make dinner before going to do my homework, but that was necessary and it was expected of me. 

I always looked forward to college and expected to go away and have my time to learn who I am. But when it came time to apply for colleges, my parents asked me to stay with them and go to the commuter college nearby. It was a very tough decision and at 18 I could not handle choosing college over my family. I chose my family and college sucked. I did not have very many friends, and the friends I did make I could not see often because my parents would expect me home right after class. I would have to ask for permission to stay on campus. During this time my parents relied on me to keep the house running - one time I went on a 2 night beach trip with my friend and her family and when I returned, I found that they ate fast food most days and did not clean or do laundry at all.

I honestly thought once I graduated and got a stable job my parents would back off and give me more freedom. But it's the opposite. In high school I used to have a 10 pm curfew but since I've turned 21, I'm usually only allowed to be out of the house for 2-3 hours (I'm expected to text them throughout this time) at a time and mostly never past 9 pm. My parents (mostly my mom) has also recently started getting on my case about not having friends that are from the same country as us and why I do not have friends from church. Also her major issue is why I do not insist on going to church.

Now to the present: my mom is in pretty bad shape and she stresses about everything. She doesn't get out much and I think she is just stuck. That's the only real way I can explain it - she's stuck. All my parents have is us kids, all other family is back in the homeland. 

Two weeks ago I asked for permission to leave the house and I was allowed two hours. It was a Saturday, during the day at around 11 am. I told them I wouldn't be home in two hours because I was taking public transit. They didn't say anything. I come home four hours later to very pissed off parents. I got the belt, I still have bruises, and lectures about following their rules, their house their rules, why don't I go out with people from church, why don't I go to church more, etc.

Before the Saturday Incident I was looking for places with my friend but things fell through. I do not want to leave my family in a bad place. I feel incredibly guilty for even thinking of moving out because they rely on me so much. But I cannot live like this anymore. I cannot deal with having to ask for permission to leave the house on a Saturday afternoon when I have my own job, my own car, my own everything, besides roof. 

A few days ago I told my mom that I'm moving out, I haven't been speaking to my father so I don't know if she's told him. But she has given me many lectures and changed her tactics each day. The first day it was When you leave, you won't have me anymore and If you leave, I'll die. These are both extremely hard to hear because all throughout my life, my biggest fear and reason for not going to college was that she would die. My conversations with her that day left me in tears. The second day she focused on the shame I would bring on the family. The third day she focused on how I used to be a good girl who knew her place and stayed in it. Now she doesn't understand why I won't stay in my place. The past few days have been extremely hard, it sucks hearing these things from your own mother. All I wish for, more than anything, is that they would support me. 

I signed a lease today. They don't know. No one knows besides my boyfriend (he's American, they don't approve, they don't know details) and a few friends. 

Now I need to figure out a way to move out and still have a relationship with my family. My mom says that if I move out they will take it as me not wanting them or needing them anymore and that's how they'll act. She says that if I move out, I will bring great shame to my family and that we wouldn't be a family anymore. I told her that if she doesn't want anything to do with me if I move 15 min away then that is on her. But the guilt is killing me. I need advice. 

TLDR: My parents are controlling, I'm moving out but they are using guilt to keep me here. It's sorta working except I signed a lease today. Now I don't want to lose them.","Me [22 F] with my parents [48 F, 50 M].

12523,Non-Romantic,226y1y,"I've been at my company for 2.5 years. One of my coworkers (we'll call her Ashley) has been here about 3 years, and is ~10 years older than me. At this point, I've received two promotions and am technically senior to her, but we currently work in different departments. We do have to collaborate a lot, and I find working with her difficult because she never seems to *get* it and she *loathes* working here. She doesn't really ever try to make connections for herself, and asks questions that to me have very obvious answers. It makes me prefer to just do things myself, which is a trap that I'm trying to avoid.


My supervisor Michelle is the VP of my department (which technically is just me, her, and a junior person), and is close friends with Ashley. The three of us are all friendly both at work and in the real world, but Ashley and Michelle are clearly closer with each other than I am with Michelle. They go out to drinks and forget to invite me until they are already walking in to the bar. We all share personal stories and have a good time together, but Michelle and Ashley share much more with each other. They are closer in age, and it makes sense that they can shoot the shit a little easier as Michelle isn't Ashley's supervisor, but she's mine. Ashley and I have been friendly longer, as Michelle has only been here about a year and a half, but I don't think Ashley views me as closely as she views Michelle.


Sort of unrelated but worth noting - up until about 9 months ago, there *was* no supervisor for my department, and Michelle was in a different department. She transferred over and became my boss - I think we were able to be a bit more open before the shift. I've told her that I'm not used to having a supervisor and was a little shocked she took the position (I expressed interest in it, but they think I'm too young). She's given me pretty much free reign to manage our junior person, but I still resent it when she refers to herself as my boss or has meetings that I think I should be involved in, but excludes me because she is VP and I'm just senior.


The real issue at hand, however, is that Michelle wants to officially take Ashley on to our team and give her more responsibility and take things off of my plate. I'm doing a lot of work that really doesn't fall under my job description, mostly because I enjoy doing some of the more tech-heavy things, but also because we both know how much Ashley hates working here. Michelle and Ashley have had conversations about this, but it's not yet official. I think it's a terrible idea. Ashley doesn't tell me when she's not going to get to a task I've assigned her, and then when I ask if she needs me to help, she *tells* me to do to it because she hasn't had time to get to it. No sorry, no please, no thank you or anything. And to make matters wore, Ashley just came back from her *month long* honeymoon where I covered 75% of her responsibility, and she never said thank you. She just came back to work and immediately resumed complaining about much she hates her job. She also barely works the minimum hours, but somehow gets away with it - our sales/marketing team works 9-6, while our designers/developers have a flexible start/end time as long as they work at least 8 hours and get their work done. Yesterday Ashley came in at 9:30, took an hour lunch break, and left at 5pm. She says she doesn't care because she fucking hates this place, but it also hurts my feelings that she doesn't care that now *I* have to do it. 


I feel trapped, because I am friendly with both Michelle and Ashley and feel like I can't be honest with my supervisor because of how friendly she is with Ashley. The only person really above Michelle is the CEO, and I know he wouldn't want to get involved, and I don't want Ashley to get fired or anything. She is a friend and I don't want to ruin that, but it's affecting my professional life, and the professional resentment is starting to leak into our personal relationship.

Dad: 50, drug and alcohol abuser turned radical Christian. Heart of gold, very charitable and generous. I am my Dad's only child. 

Stepmum: 51, very frail from a long term muscle-degenerative disease. Also a radical Christian. Very sweet and wise. 

Stepbrother1: 32, has had 5 of his 7 children taken away by social services. Very racist. 

Stepsister: 26, has two children, is unsure who fathers her youngest son. Spends more time taking pictures of herself than raising her children. 

Stepbrother2: 24, Very sweet and caring, but has severe learning disabilities, meaning he cannot read, write, count money or speak properly. 

**Mum's side of the family**

Nanna: 72, was adopted by a foster family at aged 5 because her Mother was a nymphomaniac. Married at 16, for 43 years until her husband died. Is currently having an affair with her 46 year old adopted cousin. Is somewhat racist.

Mum: 51, divorced my Dad when she was 26 because he left her for my Stepmum. Smokes a lot of weed and drinks a lot of cheap beer. Thinks that a woman's role is to cook and serve her family. Is somewhat racist.

Stepdad: 50, part time weed-dealer, smokes even more weed than my Mum. Is extremely racist. 

Brother1: 19, the first child of Mum and Stepdad. Is incredibly racist, hates authority, believes he is a hybrid of Chuck Norris and Jackie Chan. Constantly threatens to knock people the fuck out, but has never been in a fight. 

Brother2, 18. Has never had a job. Spends most of his time playing computer games and eating food served to him by my Mum. Is also racist. 
___________________________________________________

After my Mum and Dad divorced, I lived with my Mum and visited my Dad on weekends until I was 10. Unfortunately, because I argued constantly with my Stepdad, my Mum gave me up to care of social services and I moved in with my Dad at aged 10. 

Now I'm 26 and I live with my boyfriend, 25. We both have good jobs and have a pretty stable life. The only factor that causes us stress is my family, specifically, my Mum's side. They are clingy, expect lots of favours from us and get upset if we don't drop everything to deal with their drama. It's hard to get any sense out of my Mum and Stepdad because they are always high/drunk. We also find it extremely difficult to be around them and their family, because they are so horribly racist. 

We used to feel the same way about my Stepbrother1 and Stepsister, who are horribly irresponsible with their children. We found it difficult to watch them spend their time and money on themselves while their children went without, and no amount of intervention seemed to help. In the end, we stopped contact with my Stepbrother1 and Stepsister, and now we only see my Dad, Stepmum and Stepbrother2. We're much happier since we made this decision, and we're now considering cutting my Mother's family out of our lives too (this is the reason I told you about my Father's family). 

The only problem is, my Brother1 has just informed me that he's gone and impregnated a 17 year old girl. They didn't bother to use protection, and broke up around a month ago **because he went rollerskating without her**. Hopefully that gives you some idea of their maturity level. They've decided to keep the baby. His girlfriend is a major attention seeker, and informed me that she was anorexic/a self harmer/could hear voices in her head/was going to kill herself/was bullimic all in the three months I knew her, and I fear that the only reason she is keeping this baby is because she is enjoying telling everyone she's pregnant. My Brother1 is happy he's having a child because he sees it as an excuse to buy things for the baby. He actually said *I don't give a fuck. No baby of mine will have second hand shit. I spent £250 on one outfit the other day. That's what I do. I don't give a fuck. I'm gonna buy my baby what the fuck I like.*

My plans to cut contact with my family have gone awry. This baby is going to grow up full of hate and rage. He/she is going to be raised thinking all black people are scum and that it's perfectly ok to punch people in the face if you don't like them. My Mother's sister (who has just been released from prison for defrauding a pensioner of £38k) isn't the best role model either, and I despair for what will happen to this child. 

I feel like if I can somehow stay in her/his life, I might be able to have some influence and stop the baby from turning into a racist thug. But perhaps I'm being ridiculous, and there's nothing I can do, and I should just continue to stop contact with my family as planned? What do I do - stay and help or leave and protect my sanity?

I work at a restaurant that is independently owned and operated by a Christian male (63). he is a wonderful boss and great guy all around. two of his employees, Daniel (26) and Alex (21) have always seemed to be at odds. i get along very well with Daniel and consider him a friend. it's worth pointing out that he is very flamboyantly gay, which may or may not contribute to why Alex dislikes him. Daniel is a very hard worker and my boss loves him.

Alex is an equally hard worker, however, she dislikes both me and Daniel. she seems to believe I'm romantically interested in a manager she has a crush on (I'm not interested in him at all, I've told her this) and is very vocal about her hatred of me to other employees. my attitude toward this has to this point been to ignore it as reporting it will just aggravate the situation in my opinion.

however, today, just a few hours ago, I saw Alex physically assault Daniel (hitting and punching) because he asked her to butter a slice of toast. Alex is up for a managerial promotion because another manager is leaving and I find her behavior both with me and Daniel to be unprofessional and childish. Daniel came to me in tears about ten minutes ago asking if I had seen what happened and I said yes and encouraged him to report her. I'm considering reporting her as well and am unsure if I should.

Okay, so let me start off by explaining that I've had a solid amount of terrible roommates in the last 5 years, so I may be hypersensitive to the situation, but nonetheless, I'd love to hear some feedback.

I lived with a roommate last year who I met on Craigslist.  Super awesome guy and we got along great about everything.  He had to move out because he was going to school in another state, so I had to find a new roommate (which I'll call James).  

James was an old high school acquaintance and someone that I only hung out with 6-7 times.  Aside from his social awkwardness, he was cool enough to where I had no obligations letting him move in with me when he contacted me about the room.

My old roommate owned pretty much everything when I initially moved in, which led me to have to buy a TON of stuff for the apartment when he moved out.  I let James know that we'd need to buy a lot of things when he moved in and he didn't seem to mind.  James has to work two jobs in order to afford where we live, while I work for myself and have been doing well financially, so he may have gotten the idea that I could afford to buy a ton of things without him pitching in.  I found some nice furniture on craigslist and he threw down half, so we were off to a great start.

Before moving in, he let me know that he had a *HUGE* TV that he would be moving in.  RAD, I thought.  On the day of the move, he lets me know that it's about 15 years old, weighs about 300 lbs, and is a standard definition TV.  It really bummed me out because I thought he'd be pitching in something that would save us money, but I really wanted to only have nicer things in the apartment.  I told him to not worry about it and bought a big screen, mount, and tv stand without asking him for a dime.  Keep in mind he uses this TV daily.

I had to buy things before he moved in like lamps, silver wear, plates, etc., but didn't expect reimbursement because they were things I personally chose (even though he obviously uses it all since they're in commonplaces).  

Yesterday, I told him that the trash can we had was pretty gross since it was 2 years old and had mold in it, etc.  He agreed, so I told him I was going to buy a new one.  I found a really nice one for $50 and came back home to switch the cans out.  He immediately commented on how nice it was and asked me if I wanted some money for it.  I was stoked he asked, so I said yeah, if you could throw down $10, that would be awesome..  He approached me 10 minutes later telling me that because I was probably going to keep it, he didn't feel that he should pay $10 for it.  I was a little annoyed because it was such a small amount of money and I've paid over $2,000 on things for the commonplaces without getting a penny from him, but I told him it was because he'd be using it and it would obviously depreciate over a year period.  He didn't think so, so he told me he'd buy the next thing for the apartment.  The problem is, I've bought almost everything we need, so it's almost pointless to have him do that.

This problem, among other issues like me buying him beer and him awkwardly trying to ask me if he should pay me back, are starting to make me resent him.  I would consider myself to have good communication skills, but part of the reason I'm having such an issue is because of his social awkwardness (like, long pauses and awkward replies when I ask about purchasing things for our place, etc).

I think it ultimately boils down to him not having enough money to contribute to actually buying normally priced items for our place, and instead, him wanting hand-me-downs or cheaper items that look bad, which is why I only asked $10 for a $50 trash can (among other things).

I really just need to vent, but I was also curious if there's some type of unwritten rule where a roommate pitches in 1/4 (or whatever) of the cost of something if they plan on using the item?

12562,Non-Romantic,1w9cwz,"I do not live at home with my dad and his family, but I am often over several times a week to help them out with whatever they need.  To put it bluntly, they have a lot of needs, and honestly I am happy to do most of these things for them.  Anything from picking up my sister from school, to staying home to take care my siblings on days when both parents work, to picking up groceries for them when they don't have the money or the transportation (they almost never have two working cars at once, I lend them my car when I can), to being heavily involved in the care of my brother [17M], who is on the autism spectrum and non-verbal.  There is a lot to do.  But still, it gets done and I think as a whole we manage to have a functioning household.  All except in one area: keeping the house clean.  When it comes to keeping the house clean, it's just a never ending battle for my dad and I, and I'm really getting tired of it.

To put things into perspective, let me describe a regular occurrence at our house.  I'll come over Saturday morning to take care of my siblings as my dad is leaving for work, and the place will be a fucking mess.  Just shit all over the fucking place.  Half-eaten cereal bowl on the coffee table.  From yesterday.  Chip bag open on the loveseat with crumbs.  Also from yesterday.  Laundry basket overflowing, dishes piled high in the sink (if I'm lucky, dad might have already started a respective load of each before he leaves).  Floors are in dire need of a sweep.  Towels and clothes piled up in the bathroom.  Garbage needs to be taken out.  Just everything is a fucking mess.  It's really bad, and disgusting, and honestly, the house is almost NEVER clean, and when it is it sure doesn't last long.  My dad will have the place looking reasonably good on Thursday, which is usually a day off for him.  Then on Friday when my step-mom is off, over the course of A MERE DAY the place somehow just goes to complete shit.  I do not fucking know how it happens.  But it happens.  Every week.  Without fail.  And it's not just on Saturdays, it's basically whatever days my dad and I aren't there to clean up after everyone constantly, this is what happens.

Now, before you guys advise my dad and I to have a talk with my step-mom and my sister about all this, my dad has most definitely tried this already.  He has tried everything from directly asking them both, to nagging them, to sitting them down and having a heart-to-heart about how he really needs help to keep up with the housework.  Nothing ever seems to come of it.  My step-mom basically is like, Yeah, OK, whatever.  Just to get him off her back, and she continues to not do anything.  My sister doesn't have the same dismissive attitude; she'll agree and say, OK.  But just like her mom, nothing ever changes, and the cycle of hopelessness continues.

I would talk to my step-mom about this myself, but I feel like it's just not my place.  With my sister, however, I have tried a few things.  For one, I have already tried straight up asking her to help out more.  I’ve done this several times.  Each time I've said something along the lines of, Sister, this house is a wreck.  I can't really approach your mom about this because I don't feel like it is my place to tell her what to do, but between our dad and I, the both of us are just not enough to keep this place as clean as it should be.  Can I count on you from now on to help us out more?  You don’t have to be Cinderella or anything, just helping out a little bit more than you do would be a big step.”  To which she'll say simply, Yes, OK.  And she might help me out with chores more on the day that I bring this up with her, but afterwards nothing.  So there's that.  Another method I have tried is straight up asking her to do a specific thing when I want it done.  For example, just the other day I knocked on her room and was like, Yo, sister.  And she was like, What is it?  And I was like, I gotta run to the store.  The washing machine will probably finish its cycle while I'm gone, so when it finishes can you just throw the wet laundry in the dryer, then start another load in the washer for me?  And she was like, OK.  But when I came back home, it wasn't done.  I didn't want to be confrontational, but I did mention it to her saying, “You didn’t do the thing I asked you to do.”  And she was like, “What?  I didn’t know.  What did you ask me to do?”  …AREYOUFUCKINGKIDDINGME.JPG.  The last thing I’ve tried is more passive aggressive.  I’ll call her out of her room to help with a chore, let’s say for example, the dishes.  So we’re prewashing the mountain of dishes and loading them up into the washer, and as we’re doing it I’ll say things like, “Oh, this is *disgusting*.  Gross!  Ewww!  Ugh, this is why the dishes need to be done every day.”  I do this in the hopes of, idk, shaming her into doing the dishes more often?!  The thing is, I can’t really tell if she actually feels embarrassment over this or not.  I can’t tell if she even cares at all about any of the chores getting done, if I’m being perfectly honest.  I just want to grab her by her shoulders, shake her, and ask her, “Do you even care?!  Don’t you think it’s gross when nothing is clean?!  Do you think that’s an acceptable way for things to be?!  Or do you just figure someone will take care of it all the time for you?!”  Sometimes I actually think that if it wasn’t for me and my dad, our house would turn into one of those horrific episodes of Hoarders, you know, with the obscenely filthy houses.

The whole thing just makes me sad and frustrated.  I think it’s pretty obvious my sister has picked up her habits from her mom, and I just don’t know what to do about that.  We are 10 years apart, so we aren't the closest, and I haven't always been around because of school, but we've never not gotten along.  I have no idea how to teach her better habits, or how to want to have better habits.

Believe it or not, no fights have occurred over this as of yet, and I still have a fair amount of patience left.  But obviously that is not going to last forever, so I’d really like any advice anyone has to offer to help improve this situation.  I would be really grateful.  

**TL;DR** our house consistently turns into a total fucking mess whenever my dad and I aren’t around to clean it.  It’s basically never clean, it’s a mess of 5 people vs 2.  Been this way for years.

My contact with that family occurred irregularly from when I was young to middle school when it stopped almost completely. Today, I received a message from a member of that family apologizing for not playing a big role in my life. The only reason I feel I was even thought about is because my recent accomplishments have been broadcast on Facebook by my family and extended family. My problem currently is I am in the process of changing my name from my mothers maiden name to my stepfather who has been around since I was very very young. However, I have never felt truly accepted by his family. I felt it was right to take my stepfathers name though due to his raising me. But something in that message from my family member stuck with me. He said my daddy would be proud of me. I never knew my biological father and I have only now begun to feel sadness that I didn't. I also feel sadness because my family is beginning to hold me on a pedestal due to recent accomplishments when I feel I can be a very immoral person at times, but not in regards to integrity or theft. I apologize for rambling, but I just don't know how to deal with these conflicting emotions right now. I guess my question is, is it wrong for me to change my name and my identity to that of my stepfathers when I feel his family has never accepted me of one of his own and it would show my biological fathers family that I do not care for his heritage even though they have not been in close contact in past years. And then to add on, I feel bad for changing from the name of my mothers father (maiden name) when he has been the relative I feel I am most like. At this crossroad in my life, I want to make the best decision that will make me and my whole family happy I suppose. I understand why my biological fathers family didn't stay in close contact, and I hate that I was never truly accepted by my stepfathers family. My mothers family is the only family I feel has truly accepted me and even then, there is no one unifying last name there due to divorces. I know that it's just a last name, but it shows my heritage.

I did not knew how the divorce would affect my personality until a few months ago when i met a girl which showed me affection, but for not so long.

When i was a toddler, i had no real friends, my mother could not give me attention because she would have to go to work, leaving me at home with a maid. SO basically i had nobody to teach me how to socialize and love. I grew up and as a teenager i was becoming quite sociable, but still i did not realize how undeveloped my love was. I would not call my father myself when i was still living at my mothers place and now i do not call my mother from my fathers apartment.

 I always felt outside the family (from both sides) and i felt as if i did not need parental orientation, even though i would respect my parents because they were paying my bills and they would let me stay at their place. They always gave me help even thought i never asked for it, and I feel that i should repay them back with love, but i don't. (Today was my fathers birthday and i did not realize until he came to talk with me about it).


Now, if i can't even give affection to my parents, imagine how i treat the rest of the people that i know. I'm really worried with my state at this moment. I was invited to go to this girls place to sleep at hers for the night, however i could not go through with having sex and i quit at the last moment, so i left. The reason is that I was thinking it over too much and thought there was something else missing.

I fell in love with this girl that attends my school, i told her how i feel towards her and she appreciated my honesty, but she does not feel the same way as me. We became friends and we would spend allot of time together, she opened me emotionally and made me cry once because of her absence. I believe that the maternal love that i did not had as a toddler bursted few months ago, and i even gave my mother a call afterwards to spread that love that i felt at that moment.


Now that i have full consciousness of all this, i do not know what to do, i do not speak with the girl from my school anymore because i will not have her forever.

Details the backstory.


Long story short last night I reached out to her and him. I felt after more than 2 months of therapy I started to feel like I was in a better place. He didn't answer the phone, so I called a few hours later and she immediately did.



It shocked me that she answered and because she did, I didn't have a game plan on what to say (even told her that). As soon as she picked up she said she had been thinking about me, crying, and missed me. She wanted to text me on thanksgiving, or the day after to ask how mine went, but didn't. That she would eventually have reached out she just doesn't know when. But she also said she enjoyed the space because we werent fighting or anything.


We then caught up with things going on in our lives and I brought up hanging out soon and she said she wanted to take it slow because honestly it may be weird and because she still a little mad about things I said (because I tried to talk to her 1 week into the break and when she didn't respond I said she was a liar or something. She said because I said that it delayed her reaching out (that it wouldn't have been this long) and she didn't want to talk to me ever again but here she is now).



After we hung up I sent her this text and I'm not quite sure what to make of her response:

Also there is an issue with the boyfriend who apparently still doesn't want to talk to me. She said she would ask him a lot do you think about X? and he would say, ya but then I remember the things he said to me  So he is still upset, though I'm not sure what to do because I honestly never said anything bad to the guy. I'm not sure if this is gonna cause problems or what as idk if I can have 1 of them back and not the other.

We used to hang out together all the time and we got along very well. A lot of things changed when we went to high school, though. We went to separate schools and I kind of figured that we would both become different people but I hoped we could still stay friends. Now, neither of us were social butterflies but high school has allowed me to come out of my shell more and become a much more social and confident person. It did the exact opposite to him, and I'm not sure why. He never really wants to do much other than play video games and all he ever talks about is obscure animes. I can't remember the last time I had a discussion that wasn't about anime with him. In addition, he's begun to act very arrogant and it can easily get on my nerves. Our personalities clash way too much at this point. I feel kind of bad for feeling like this but it's becoming more and more difficult for me to hang out around him. So, what I've been doing is just trying to distance myself from him. I'll just try to avoid discussions with him when we're hanging out and if I do have to talk to him, I'll just give very brief responses. I don't have the banter with him that I do with my other friends. I can be very witty and very (jokingly) insulting. That's how you know you're a friend of mine. But with Steve, I'll just treat him like one of my acquaintances and be very polite and boring. I'll come up with excuses not to hang out with him and I feel pretty bad about it sometimes.

So I met this girl, let's call her Leah. We go to the same college and we are both taking the same program. We met over about a year and a half ago in a class we both took. We hit it off, talking about soccer, getting to know each other and such. She's a friendly, confident, cheerful, and a strong gal. (I wasn't as interested in her as much at the time because I was trying to get over a girl whom I've had problems with in the past, but Leah was cool to be around with, so I try to better myself so that I could prevent fucking things up with her) Anyways, Leah and I would then exchange numbers and would continue contacting each other on Facebook, WhatsApp, or through text, though I do most of the imitating (again, I didn't mind at the time).


Fast forward to 2015, I noticed she started to become a little distant, but I didn't let it phase me, I assumed she was busy with school and work. She would sometimes forget to reply back, or would reply the next day, but I didn't mind it. She once stated that she was a really bad texter. We laughed it off and ended the conversation on a good note.


There was this one time where she seemed to be upset at something, I asked her if everything was alright, she replied yes, but I knew there was something wrong, I asked her if she wanted to talk about it, she refused. I told her that she could talk to me if she wanted and I would listen, she then replied she was having problems with her man, leaving her stressed out and sad...I didn't like the look of that, but I replied tried to back away from the conversation, I kind of took it as rejection, then again, I feel as if she wanted to see my reaction. I tried to not to look too much into it. Whatever the case was, I promised myself to back away from her. But my stubborn self went on and persisted anyways. I did try to be careful with her though, so I decided to talk to her as friends...at least that's what I think it was.


Fast forward to three weeks ago, it's the 14th of May, we're done exams, we both finish our 2nd year in college, everyone's stress-free. Victoria Day was around the corner, (a federal Canadian public holiday for those who don't know what it is) I shoot her a phone call and invited her out to grab something to eat and watch the fireworks that day (she loves fireworks, according to her). I think she felt as if she was put on the spot, or was shocked at my invitation, so she said that she would let me know when she isn't busy. I told her to let me know by Sunday night. Sunday night came and she thanked me for the invitation then said she was actually busy. I assumed she was actually busy and not interested at the same time, so I decided to lay low for a while.


10 days later, I was exhausted and decided do something I deeply regret. I decided to prank her. Phone was down for the day, so I used my brother's phone to contact her. I wanted to see if she had an iPhone, so I did that effective. Power text to see if her phone would reset, turns out she wasn't using an iPhone so she asked who it was and I kept trying to dismiss it, saying I was trying to prank a gf who always seems to pay attention to her phone. Here is when I messed up; I followed it up with who do you think it is? From that point on, we played the guessing game. She asked if it was me, but I dismissed it again. She seemed very angry after this. So I eventually gave up cause I didn't want to make it out like I was lying to her and creeping her out. I called her 8 minutes later and she recognized my voice. She then hung up, without offering me a chance to explain myself. I later texted her that we should at least talk about it and she wasn't having it. She tired to dismiss it by saying she didn't give a fuck and didn't like her time being wasted by stupid little kid shit.

I then made another mistake; I told her the reason why I did it by expressing my interest into her over the past year, she then became cold and said but I don't know you and I don't really care to get to know you.. She then cut me off. This confused me because we did get to know each other in the beginning. I was shocked. In response, I confronted her about her interactions with me. She also stated that she was being polite and friendly, nothing more. Once again, I was confused because it seemed as if she has changed. I sent a wall of text (another mistake) one last time, promising that I would stop, give her space and leave leave her alone for now and left it at that. I didn't expect her to reply. Three days after that conflict, she deleted me off Facebook. I wasn't active on Facebook at all on the day she deleted me, so I woke up the next morning, and noticed her off my friends list.

I'll start from the start,


Growing up my 'dad' was never really around, He was a truck driver so he was gone many nights of the week. When he was home he got drunk and got voilent towards my mother. My mum left him when I was about 6 years old, but he stuck around for another 2 years trying to sort things out with my mum.


I have 2 younger sister's (16,19) and an older step sister and bother (23, 26) I didn't know So well (step sister and brother have a different father who is lovely) I never really fit in or looked like my younger sister's, I always felt left out. A few weeks ago me and my mum were talking and she tells me that there is a chance that I could have the same father as my step sister and brother,  which would explain a lot. 


I know that it won't change anything knowing who my father is, but I feel so lost not knowing who he is, a chance to find out my father isn't the abusive But I grew up with. I'd like to know peoples opinions if it would be worth finding out who my real father is, if it turns out to be the same father as my older sister and brother should I try to form a relationship with him? Does anyone have any similar situations?

12612,Non-Romantic,3g1u8i,"So obviously this isn't a huge deal, but it's been bugging me for awhile and I'm starting to wonder if I should say something. My fiance's mother is a very nice woman, but can be somewhat overbearing, and isn't a very good listener. She also loves to baby her kids, even though they are all grown men now. 

In her house, they keep a lot of junk foods/snack foods. For the most part they get away with it, as they are naturally pretty thin, but in the past few years my fiance has been starting to put on weight. He never had to worry about healthy eating habits before since he was always tall and thin, and now that's its catching up to him it's been hard for him to change. 

Meanwhile, I have always had to watch what I eat very carefully, or else I put on weight. My family always ate very healthy, and never kept snack or junk food in the house. So, when its around, it's super super tempting for me. I'm really trying hard to shed a few pounds for the wedding, and my fiance could stand to lose some weight himself. 

His mother has complained to me several times about how much weight my fiance has put on. However, she sort of implies that I should be doing more to make sure that he watches his weight. I should encourage him to get to the gym, things like that. She very much comes from the perspective that men need to be taken care of by women who know better. I do not think my fiance is a giant man-child. He is a smart, strong, capable man who does not need my help running his life. 

Anyway, I do make an effort to buy healthy groceries, cook healthy dinner, and keep junk food out of the house. However, every time we go to her house, she tries to send us home with tons of junk food. I always politely refuse, and explain I don't like to keep it in the house. So then what she does, is she waits until my fiance goes over to the house on his own, and sends it home with him. 

I've always sort of laughed it off, and just chalked it up to her being a mother, but recently she went way over the top. She threw a big party and, ofcourse, at the end of the night she tried to send me home with desserts. I politely declined and explained I am on a strict diet right now and I really don't want it in the house. My finace stops home two days later, and comes back with 6 slices of boston cream pie, 2 huge bags filled with cookies, and 3 tins of chocolate chip muffins. Like really? It just felt a little bit like dilberate. Also, since I'm being really strict on my diet, that means my fiance is going to eat all of that himself. Which is fine, he is an adult, but then she is going to ask me, once again, why he is gaining weight.

I talked to my fiance about it, and he apologized for not being more considerate of my requests when he brought this food home, but he doesn't think I should say anything to his mother, and that she doesnt do it on purpose. This time, it did feel kind of on purpose. Should I say something?


   
**tl;dr**: Fiance's mother always send him home with junk food after I've explained to her I do like it in the house.

12616,Non-Romantic,26fj0s,"This is a really long one, but I've honestly got nowhere else to turn. 

Bit of backstory: I'm not coping very well with several aspects of my life. My mother has her own issues stemming from work (police officer with shitty hours and shitty bosses) and she takes out her frustration on me by making my life hell, through verbal taunts, favoritism (anything from giving my siblings lunch money and not me, to taking everyone else out for dinner and to go see a movie) encouraging my 2 brothers and 2 sisters (I'm the eldest) to also participate in the teasing and winding me up. 

I'm doing it pretty tough at school as well. I take Chemistry, Physics, English and the two most advanced math classes, and the workload is piling right up, stressing me out. I've quit my local sports team in order to focus, and I don't have time to hang out with my friends every weekend or even at school during lunchtime, so I've really drifted away from them.

All this is making me super stressed. I think I must have some sort of anger issue, because when things are getting tough, I start getting mad. Normally I'm alone at home, and I just get up and start pacing around the house. If I'm at school, I get this burning desire to yell, scream, smash something or hit someone. I've never acted on those more violent urges, but surely it's only a matter of time!

When I get angry, I take it out on my best and only remaining friend, a girl who I'm pretty sure is only my friend because I share all her classes. This girl has her own issues with friends, a group of girls who are best friends to her face but so, so cruel to her when she's not around. I'm literally the only person she can confide in. She tells me all her personal struggles and secrets, from her mum's asshole partner to her fears about her dad's health. 

Normally I say something cutting and cruel; on Friday I called her out for talking about someone else behind their back. Instead of just telling her, I reamed her out for being 'childish, mean and cruel,' in front of everyone sitting with us in the class. 

I've done this so often, I can predict what is going to happen before it does. First, she retreats into her shell. Instantly, I can see that I've hurt her; without fail, I dismiss her as being upset for getting pulled into line. I'm usually still seeing red; apologising never even occurs to me. Then, for the next few days at least, whenever I'm in the room she is cold, curt and gives me the cold shoulder, making it impossible for me to even have a conversation with other people with us.

 Now, I start to realise what I've done and how I've made her feel. Regret and sadness fill me. I truly believe that I know how people suffering from depression must live their lives: under a constant crushing pressure from their emotions. All I want is to see her smile at me and tell me another joke, but she can't even stand to sit near me, let alone give me the time to apologise properly. After a few days of this, I'm usually pushed to the breaking point. All I can think about is how I could possibly fix the damage I've done, and whether or not she'll finally realise I'm a terrible friend.

Last night, after we were both leaving the school production we were in, I went over to her car and confronted her. I told her I knew what I'd done was wrong, and I felt terrible about it. There were so many things I wanted to say, but I couldn't because I didn't know how or what exactly to tell her. It ended in a screaming match, with both of us nearly in tears. I said I was sorry, she said 'I am too.' But it felt like she was only saying that because she felt she had to. 

When I got home, I sent her a massive text message detailing all the ways in which I'd made a mistake, all the reasons why I thought I'd done it, how terrible I'd felt when I'd spent three days of our production sitting in a classroom trying to hide from everyone else, and how I wished I was a better friend. She told me that apologies meant nothing if I couldn't change the way I behaved.

12618,Non-Romantic,21m5fv,"I have placed abuser in quotes in the title because it is still somewhat questionable to me. I don’t think his actions were intended to be abusive, and perhaps they do not qualify. 

The closest descriptor I can think of for this person is that, at the time, he was essentially my brother. We went on study abroad together, and ended up being the only two people from our program attending. We are both in long term, long distance relationships with other people, and his girlfriend was living relatively close by (a few hours away. I had a 9 hr time difference).  He was incredibly integral to my support system when I was far from my SO, and I am a very shy person that doesn’t make friends easily. He ended up being my only friend on the continent. 

I am typically quite down for the first few weeks of a semester because of my LDR. While in the past he had been sympathetic, this time he started mocking or belittling my sadness at being away from my SO. Our interaction got to the point where every time I saw him I would end up crying from one insensitivity or another. Ultimately I asked him to leave me alone – I didn’t want the friendship to be irrevocably damaged, and I didn’t think he was being malicious. I intended to start talking again after we finished studying away, though I was having some problems letting my guard down around him.



That in and of itself does not necessarily qualify as abuse – perhaps I was in a fragile state of mind, as he puts it. Later, though, I sent him an email that was intended to serve as an olive branch.He responded after the semester was over by telling me that he was not taking credit for any of the things that had happened between us.  The two interpretations I can see for this line are that he either (a) is telling me that I deserved the treatment he gave me, or (b) is telling me that he did not cause me pain at any point, leaving only my choice to stop talking as something that “happened between us” that semester.  He is telling me that I was imagining the poor treatment early in the semester. 




At this point, I had a very hazy memory of the semester – I think I still have a great deal of it blocked, and I had more of it unavailable to me then. What I did remember clashed utterly with the idea that either I deserved his harsh treatment, or that I was imagining it.  As I’ve said, I don’t credit the first explanation. 




The second explanation, that I was imagining it, proves much more problematic. No one else was there, and all I had for proof of his behavior was my shit memory and a few lines on Google chat. It was his word against mine, and I couldn’t trust mine. It made me feel like my mind was falling apart. I do not know if this is gaslighting. I think it may be. I believe this clash is what has caused me to begin having panic attacks at the sight of him.




(Incidentally, when I was capable of looking back through my chat logs, I did find proof that he at one point acknowledged that he had at least once been responsible for hurting me. That has done a lot for my mental state, but also has me questioning what he meant by “not taking credit”.)





---

It has been some time, and I am now capable of being in the room with him. I would like to confront my fears head on, and to talk with him. I have taken a few steps towards reconnecting with him. I do not anticipate ever being as close as we were, but I would like to be able to think about this person who was once important to me as at least a neutral force.

 My problems are as follows:

*  I am not sure that this was emotional abuse or just my “fragility”. As I said before, I don’t think he was actually attempting to gaslight me or abuse me. 
* I also have some doubts about the validity of my interpretation of his refusal to take credit. I don’t know what else he could have meant, but I am unwilling to put words in his mouth if there are still other options.

* If this does qualify as abuse, how can I approach him in a way that does not scare him or make him angry? He likes to be the good guy, and I have learned from this experience that it is best not to suggest that he can be anything else. I would like to be as honest as I can be. However, I don’t want to ruin a reconnection by saying the words “emotional abuse” if I don’t have to. 


Has anyone ever had success in this sort of thing before? Are there things I should watch out for or prepare myself with? I still occasionally panic when he is too loud or standing in an exit. Is this even something I should be doing?

12664,Non-Romantic,3byvle,"My aunt Angela is losing her mind. Let's set back about 7 years ago when she started having issues; she had chronic back pain after giving birth to her 2nd child and the doctor prescribed her Tramadol for the pain. This ended up being downward spiral of her becoming addicted, to the point where she would be taking 30-40 a day! Whenever we confronted her, she would just deny all allegations and continue to get Tramadol on the side (actually buying them off people because she was abusing her prescription at the doctors so they cut her off).

Angela has two young children [11M &amp; 8F] and does not communicate with them very well, and I mean she will literally scream at them about anything. Because the kids have grown up this way, the kids now yell back, constantly swear and at times quite violent. She's very manipulative with her children and will brainwash them. For example, it was revealed a year ago that the oldest child had a different father (btw she's a single mother), so for 10 years, this guy who's been in my cousins life consistently has been looking after a kid who isn't his own. This guy reacted in a bad way and didn't want to look after my cousin anymore because he wasn't the dad which was a shitty thing to do, but then Angela would poison my cousins mind and tell him what a terrible dad he is and he never loved him etc. Now my cousin hates this guy.

She is also terrible with money and has been in an insane amount of debt for years, but continues to waste her money. She gets paid more than my own family due to all her benefits she is getting from the government but the money is gone the same day she is paid.

Fast forward to last November where the real trouble started. Angela has always been trying to look for a partner, looking for her own happiness instead of focusing on the kids. She's went with guys in the past who have been abusive to her and she would still go crawling back.

This time she fell in love with a guy who is in prison. She was completely head over heels with him and shot down anyone who said to her this was a bad idea. We done a bit of research on the guy and he's in for assault, knifing someone and messing their face up, however he was doing a longer sentence than what he should have and was in there for 8 years which only tells me that he's been misbehaving in prison.

I should probably bring my Nan up in this; she looked after the kids A LOT, basically every day and she done a fantastic job. My aunt would take advantage of this and give her the kids all the time to feed them (my Nan is on a very low paying job, can't afford to retire and feed herself never mind two young kids to feed too and my aunt won't help her financially). So her concern was with the kids.

This guy (Warren) was released from prison a few weeks after dating my aunt. He moved into hers straight away. My Nan was more open minded than the rest of us and allowed Angela to bring Warren to her house to meet him; my Nan said she couldn't sleep that night because his eyes gave her the chills, she said that he is the essence of evil.

As the weeks went on, we find more information about Warren; he's a herion user and steals from people's houses and stores in town to feed his habit. My Aunt would be the driver, and at this early stage is all she did. 
The kids were torn, some days they hated Warren, other days they would love him. 

Angela would post on Facebook 24/7 how much she loves her man and true love and all this. They got engaged pretty quickly (about 3 months in). She got his name tattooed on her arm with the date they met too.

We started to see worrying behaviours from Angela. When she was on Tramadol, she would be full of energy, but she started coming round (she would drive to my Nans) to my Nans and could barely keep her eyes open and was slurring words. Her pupils would be huge, and couldn't keep her head up. We immediately confronted her when she was in a better state and just said that she's tired.

Soon after this, her and Warren broke up. The reason why was because he stole her car, bank card and my cousins Xbox One games and planned on selling them and stealing money from her bank account so he could get bags of herion. He was already out of his face driving and someone reported him to the police and they arrested him straight away.
Angela was heartbroken, crying non stop about how he could do this to her etc. And this is when she would reveal everything about him.

He stole from people's houses, and has killed the owners dogs if they don't have the money, he's raped her, he would be passed out in the living room with the needle stuck in his arm, he stuck bags of herion up his arse to hide from the police which my Aunt had to fish them out, he supplies her with valiums, he's sexually abused animals (unsure if it was her own dog or not) and constantly stole off her.
Three days after being arrested she goes back with him.

She's in complete denial about everything she told us, or can't remember saying it, and says she loves him no matter what. At this point my poor Nan has had enough and has reported her to social services so she can keep the children at her place, away from this unsafe environment.

Now I'll cut this short to the latest as this is such a long post.

I work in a Game store in town, and I was just about the start my shift when I got told that we've had two controllers stolen from us but it was caught on CCTV, and reported to the police. I decided to look at the CCTV and low and behold, it's Warren. When the police came back, I confirmed to them who it was but he's well known in the area by the police. Might I add that he was arrested the previous day for shoplifting from another store which just so happens to be my deputy managers girlfriends workplace so he wasn't too popular around town.

I was absolutely livid and so embarrassed that I angrily messaged my aunt saying I was done with her and I wanted those controllers back. She messaged back straight away saying she's not with him anymore and that none of the family has been there for her etc and she's coming into my store to buy a phone for my cousin. I message back saying she'll get refused service. This riled her up and tried to guilt trip me by saying my cousin is heartbroken (I'm close with my cousin as we are very alike) and she's sick of everyone in the family and she was gonna report me to my boss (who would also have refused service). At this point my phone was taken off me at work. I told my parents when I got home and my Dad was very angry, he tried to phone her but she blocked all of our numbers. 

The next day my Dad had saw my aunt with Warren in the car (so she was actually still with him) and they were parked outside this house where Warren would get high on herion. The back seat of the car was pushed forward which suggested to my Dad that the kids were there too, so my Dad phoned the police and reported her. Just as he was driving away, my aunt came out of the house looking out of her face and my Dad stupidly waved at her to show he's saw her with that scum bag.
About an hour later, she comes to our house and my dad answers. She screams at him that she's getting him done for harassment. My dad just shuts the door in her face and walks away. As he's walking away, she's screaming through the letterbox that my mum has been cheating on my dad for years. There was an incident 4 years ago where my mum kissed another guy but no way did she sleep with someone else.

That night I get a phone call from my sister who is out of town for the night and says that Angela has posted something on Facebook about mum and dad. Since she's blocked us all, we couldn't see it however she hadn't blocked my boyfriend yet who happened to with me at the time. She had posted a status about how disgusting our family were and that my mum is a serial cheat who slags off with guys in toilets at bars, my dad is nothing but an evil vicious man who no one in the family likes. 

My mum messaged her through my boyfriends Facebook to say she was done with her and she can't believe she's publicly done that. We had loads of people message us and ask if we were okay and they know it's not true.

A couple of days ago, it was obviously eating my mum up what she did because she messaged her asking why she lied about her being a cheat and she replied with that she wanted to hurt my dad for waving at her(!) and she is never leaving Warren and our family are quick to judge because he was an ex-con and ex-herion user (?!) It sounds like she's believing her own lies and she's lost the plot.

Sorry for the long post, it's a lot of drama to deal with.
What do I do reddit? Do I try and sort this situation out so that I'm not missing out on being in my cousins lives or just completely cut ties with her?

We all moved together to a different city for university after we graduated from high school. Initially it was only going to be me, boyfriend and good friend, however, Sam joined us as well. 


I drove my car during the move with my boyfriend and Sam and I knew from the second I picked him up that we weren't going to get along. My boyfriend and good friend were excited to live with him though, so I decided I would ignore my feelings and try get along with him for their sake.


The drive was an absolute nightmare, we argued and didn't agree on anything, he would criticise my driving and my decision making. He didn't contribute any money towards the accomodation during the trip (the drive took 3 days) and complained about where we were staying the whole time. My boyfriend and I went out for food once and when we came back the hotel smelt and we discovered he forgot to flush the toilet after doing a number 2....


After a month of living together, he decided to cook some baked beans. After cooking them, he then decided that he didn't want them and stuck them in the fridge. We asked him after a week if he was going to eat them, and if not could he please clean them as we only have limited space and limited dishes and he responded saying he would. 3 or 4 days later he had still not cleaned it, so we asked again. 

We continued asking everyday for a week, he would laugh, say yes, and not do it. At this point boyfriend and I realised what was going on and decided we need to have a house meeting with him because it was really bothering us. 


He acted like he had no idea the baked beans was an issue and acted as though he was a victim. 

He has always tried to pick arguments with me and at times I have felt very uncomfortable hanging out with my boyfriend and good friend while he is around. 

He is half Asian half Australian. When we are all having a conversation in the living room, and boyfriend or I ask him something, very very unrelated to his race and cultural background, he ALWAYS responds with 'that is rascist'. However when good friend asks him something related to his race and we ask why he isn't called racist he responds by saying 'it's not actually rascist because it's racist if he isn't being racist to me'. 


He has no social skills, always talking about 'taking himself' (masterbating) in front of me. I have told him how uncomfortable this makes me but he still continues to talk about it.

This isn't even half of the things he has done, I could write a whole novel but basically: 
- he never does his allocated housework (WHICH HE PICKED!)

12673,Non-Romantic,3666ir,"I know this might come off as me being ungrateful or a little harsh but I am really at a loss for words when dealing with her.

A little backstory; I love my mom and dad and the rest of my family with all of my heart. They have provided me with a great education with minimal student loan debt on my part and have raised me to be (what I consider to be) a great man. I come from a very small town where every single member of my extended family ives within 5-10 minutes of each other, so there was a lot of togetherness. But anyway, enough backstory.

I graduated from college and have been working in a town two hours away from my hometown for the past year. I really enjoy finally being able to do things for myself and be independent and I am afraid that my mom is having a hard time dealing with that. In the past, she has used the financial assistance my parents gave me as a way to manipulate me to feel bad for not being able to visit as much or call every single day when I get busy, and that really bothers me. Other family members have berated me saying that they would be unable to get a nice retirement home due to the money they gave to me for school, money that I have always been extremely appreciative of and never asked for in the first place. It feels like it was all used as a way to manipulate me to make me feel like I have to go home more often when I have things going on and am growing up and an adult. I know I will always be her little boy but I'm not always going to be her idea of a little boy and don't need her in every aspect of my life like I did when I was younger.

The boiling point has been reached very recently as I will be going away to graduate school in a few months and moving far away from home. I have wanted all of the decisions from an apartment to student loans to be my personal decisions with little help as I need to learn how to do things for myself because I enjoy having control over the things that are going to effect me. All in all, it's just frustrating for me trying to explain that I still love and appreciate her all the same even though I don't get to visit as much or talk as much when on the phone. I am a very introverted, independent person and it's hard to convey that without sounding like an ungrateful kid. I am very different from my older sister who visits home every weekend and can talk on the phone with her for hours and that doesn't really help my situation when she and my mom bad mouth me and when every time I go home I get scolded for not visiting as much.

My sister has been dating this guy for 6 years. They haven't dated anyone else. Only themselves. They are constantly arguing and fighting for silly things. 

This wasn't an issue until we moved in within 100 feet of his place. That means that he's constantly around. Either at our place or we'll do things as a group together. 

He's the eldest child. And I mention this because I'm the eldest as well and I understand that he wants to always be in control. It's his way or the highway. We have always butt heads. And that was fine up until last Friday. In the past, I would bite my tongue because I didn't want to hurt my sister. I see that she's caught in the middle of us and that's not what I want for her. 

Last Friday, we went out to the bars with a big group of people (10+) without a certain bar in mind. We reached downtown and some people scattered to their desired bar. I didn't want to pay cover so my boyfriend and I said bye and left to go to our bar. After noticing that that bar was way too full, we returned to the group. They had still not decided on a bar. All of a sudden, sisters boyfriend explodes. My sister took him aside and tried to control the situation but he just kept screaming. Mind you, this was in front of all his friends and the crowds of people. 

She finally calmed him down. We walked over to them and his friends started talking to him. Her eyes were swollen from crying. His friend told him to go to the bar he wanted to go to and that my sister would probably go with him. I don't know if he said this to spite me but he replied with No she won't. She'll probably go with her sister! in such a tone. Like it was the worst thing that could happen. 

At this point, I just walked away to avoid conflict. I was so angry. So what if she wanted to go with her sister? He said it in such a way that made me so angry. I walked off without any worry from my sister. She didn't call to ask if I was alright or anything. She looked scared to leave her boyfriends side. 

And thats what it boils down to. I bugged her about it all weekend and they finally had a talk today and he told her that he doesn't want her to side with me on anything. He thinks that shes always on my side. And that he doesn't like me because I tell him what to do. I not once told him what to do on Friday. I did my own thing. He constructed this idea that I'm the wrong person and thats what hes trying to convince my sister and everyone else about. 

I feel really badly for my sister. I don't want her to be in a relationship where she is told what to do and is always controlled. But at this point I don't know what to do. He's slowly trying to put us against each other and I have a sense that it is working. Help me out please.

So I am in need of advice regarding my mother. To begin, my family is very very close. I consider my mother my best friend, and its always been her, myself, and my sister [11 F] against the world. 

So my mother and my step-father got a divorce around two years ago after being married 15 years. It came completely out of the blue and stunned everyone. He had pretty much been my dad growing up as my actual father passed away when I was young. Turns out my step-father was cheating on my mom so they went their separate ways, unfortunately I don't really communicate with him anymore.

Flash forward to now... My mother has been dating a new man for about a year. He's okay, but not really anything special. I like him for the most part, except a couple exceptions....

This man, we will call him Dan, has cheated on my mother twice now with his ex wife and even had a pregnancy scare with her. My mother knows all this but after he begged took him back. She truly believes he is a changed man. 

My sister and I see him much differently as you can imagine. 

Anyway, he frequently comes to my house and spends a lot of time with my mother. I try and be civil with him to make her happy even if he is on my shit list. 

The problem is my mother acts like a completely different person around him. She treats me and my sister much more strict and goes off on us for the smallest things. All the while acting like a 16 year old who has got her first boyfriend. 

I have tried to confront my mother about this but she denies it and gets very angry and defensive. How do I go about making her see the way she treats my sister and I while he is around? And how can I make this stop? I want her to be happy but I honestly wish she had never met him sometimes...

For example, today my old neighbors [Brothers, M 13 and 16] came over to my house to hang out. My brother is the cooler kid and doesn't give an honest shit about me. He takes my stuff, hits me, etc. Every time I do something I annoy him and he has said, that would be funny if you died haha. Anyways, they came over and played Xbox, used my controller (customized $250 controller from my old days) and took my chargers for their phones. I had to deal with it. I feel really sad about how they treat me. 

Also, I was at tennis practice and I kid I was playing with beat me, so I said to myself that was a bad loss and my coach  (nothing to do with a teenager, grown adult) barked Shut up. You lost. He kept rubbing the loss in and at the end he called me unhealthy (I tried my best, no joke.) 

I'm told I have a bad taste in music. I'm told I'm a loser for trying to quit PMO ( /r/nofap ). Whenever I make a comment, it's dumb or not smart (because it is a smart comment hehe). 

Nobody really likes me. The friends that I do have and that I can talk to don't judge me which is why I call them friends. They are not super supportive. I feel like just 'cause I'm smart people just beat up on me. You'll never do well in life. and  I'll be surprised if you even can rake up a Million dollars over your lifetime.

So some things have been going down since my initial post, and I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with it. My manager, after I spoke to him, put in a very official final warning type thing where they sat him down and told him straight off the bat that was he was doing was illegal, it's harrassment in the workplace etc. They gave him strict instructions to not bring any of this up again. 

Since then, things had been working okay. I really only worked with my co-worker (James) in big groups and he stayed well-behaved. However, after a while my manager assigned us to work just the two of us (as we do on some venues on weekdays) after checking with me if it was okay, which I thought it would be. Here things started to get a bit tricky. The thing is, that James recently got a car, and offered me rides to and from work, in a very weird way. He started doing this even when he was not working. To my knowledge, it was mostly me he was doing this too. When he was not working, he would also drive around between the venues and stand with us at the door. His behaviour towards me was also very strange. It was a continuous joke that James had that I was being unpleasant, hostile, unfriendly. These were comments he'd make *constantly*. If I was not feeling very talkative for some reason he'd be very confrontational and asking me why I was upset with him.

James was also upset if I was being affectionate with someone, like one member of staff (Philip) that I have known for years and that I hugged once in front of James, and another regular that hugged me when he came into the venue. Both incidents sparked a few remarks from his side. Another time (I was not there) he had found out that a co-worker of ours had helped me move house, and was apparently asking incessant questions regarding this. These things made me uncomfortable.

There were a few other things, but I had it about a week ago when I was working alone with James. I was already in a bit of a mood I guess so I wasn't at my best (I had a tough week) and I needed to speak to my manager about rota changes, so I texted him and he replied with that he'd come down to speak to me (unclear if he meant the same night or if he wanted to meet up in the week), which upset James. He kept saying that if I requested my manager to come down my manager would take it as James doing something wrong, and after repeating this a few times I snapped and said something like this isn't about you, fucking drop it. I was angry at the end of the night so I wanted to walk the 20 minutes home, and James asked me 2 or 3 times repeatedly if I wanted a lift when I was saying no. He then stopped his car when I was halfway down the street and asked 2 more times and I told him no repeatedly. 

Bar staff told me that when James had been working the next night, they'd asked him why he wasn't driving me home and he replied something like she didn't want to. As the conversation went on, bar staff mentioned something of us hanging out at Philip's house which was a few weeks ago - and James immediately took it as that's where I'd gone the night before and went is that where she was going - to his house??. He told me about this and it made me very uncomfortable to say the very least. My whereabouts should really not be of his concern!

After hearing about this I went for coffee with my manager and brought this up. He was very angry and concerned to say the least. I told him that I might be overreacting slightly, and he disagreed. He apologised for not having fired James straight off the bat, and told me that I'd never have to work with him again - in fact he was fired immediately. He would also be banned from any venue we have a contract with so if he was to come around to the bars like he had before my manager would have a personal issue with him. My manager was also concerned as to if James would show up at my house etc., luckily I made sure that he does not know my new address. I was told that I can call anyone in management any time of the night if James contacts me in any way and they can help me. Otherwise he suggested I call the police. I told him that it would not likely escalate to stalking, so it was nothing to worry about most likely.

I am still wondering if he is just being slightly socially obnoxious and I am overreacting here, and the reason I don't want him coming around to work etc. is because I feel slightly guilty which I am not sure I am justified in. I am glad this whole ordeal is over though.

12776,Non-Romantic,2tk3en,"Hi r/relationships. I am in a bit of a shock right now after coming home for the weekend from school. My mom told me  that while I was away at school, my sister had an outburst and called her a demon monster tyrant. I was shocked to find this out. My family has always had their fair share of issues, but these words used are the worst my sister Ann has ever said.

When I asked Ann about what happened, she told me that she is not sorry for what she says and believes these words to be true. She said she thinks our mom emotionally abused both of us and that I cannot see this. I think that Ann is paranoid. She is spending a year taking classes back at school and doesn't have a lot of friends in our hometown. She just sits at home all day on her computer and has lost about 3 good friends recently. Ann said she realized these 3 friends were bad friends to her and she has started to distance herself from them. Ann also quite  a bit of time at home reading psychology papers, which is how she came to the conclusion that our mom is a demon and abuser. She said her want to read these psychology papers is normal because she is interested in psychology (her undergrad major) and wants to be a doctor. 

I'm unsure of what to think. While my mom can be a bit harsh at times, I think it is because of the way my mom grew up. My mom grew up in East Asia and was one out of 7 children. Her Asian culture and upbringing is very different from the American culture Ann and I grew up in. I do not think we were abused in any way. My mom is not the most supportive person, but she is honest and caring. She is taking $10,000 to pay for my sister to go back to school and take classes. She is trying to help Ann get into medical school or find other career options.

Now onto my sister's background. She's has anxiety and has been seeing a therapist for it. But she's also always been a little weird in the sense that she's always thought something was wrong with her. For example, at some points in time she thought she had glaucoma and now she thinks she has a thyroid disease. Even when Ann's doctor tested her for thyroid disease, the report came back normal. But Ann said the range which they used to test was too broad, so it was not enough evidence that she doesn't have a thyroid disease. She then went to an endrocrynlogist thinking her general practitioner was wrong.

Reddit, I really need help here. I'm unsure of what to do. Part of me thinks that my sister is sitting at home without a lot of social interactions so she is getting a bit paranoid. She also is not independent at all and my parents pay for everything for her.

Not sure what the best place to post this is. So for the past 10 ish years I've historically had one or two close friends with a few acquaintances. In the last few years my social circle dwindled to one close friend and my SO. I wasn't super happy about it but I've struggled with social anxiety so I've found it really hard to push myself to be more social. 

That friendship ended and I decided I was going to make an effort to be more proactive. I was finishing up a school program and I found that classmates were really friendly. While I was there I felt like I had finally found a group of friends that I liked and would make an effort to hang on to.

But since graduating it's been much harder to get together. People are really noncommittal and i've often found that people will say they're interested in doing something or meeting up only to say they're busy on the day of.

12791,Non-Romantic,3csl9l,"27(F) here writing about the actions of my little brother 24(M). My brother has managed to cause a huge explosion in my family over the course of the past week, and frankly I can't deal with it anymore. Get ready because this is kinda long.

Some back story: my brother has always been self-absorbed and he has no trouble lying to get what he wants. This was amplified when he was a child, but seemed to do it less as he got older, at least where I was concerned. He is also gay. (I've never had a problem with this at all, but it plays into what's going on.) About my parents, they are divorced, Mom has always been pretty distant, but opened up to me after getting treatment for depression, very bad at giving emotional support even after this however. Dad is an alcoholic and I've never been able to have an adult relationship with him. After the divorce (I was 13) his personality totally changed and the alcoholism got way worse. He loves me and my brother, but he made that his entire life. Now that I'm an adult he often lays the guilt on hard during phone conversations about how much he misses me and my brother and the way we were when we were little. These conversations get worse when he calls me at night and he's drunk. Could do an entire post about this, but since this one is about my brother I'll stop here. The bits about my Dad are significant for what comes later.

Anyway, as the older sibling I've always felt it was my responsibility to protect my little brother, especially after the divorce when I realized my Dad was no longer a reliable parent, and my Mom was incapable of giving emotional support. So as we get older, I'm the one he turns to when things go wrong. (I realize I kind of dug my own hole on this one…) Problem being with this is that I was never equipped to fill a parent role when things go wrong, things like calling me in the middle of the night when I'm at college when he had a house party and Dad comes over drunk and starts punching his friends in the face. I told him to call the police, and then I panicked and cried. So, I've been the go-to phone call, even when other phone calls should be made first.

Now onto what happened. This past Christmas we were all at my Mom's house on Xmas eve, we were having some drinks, and my brother and my Mom got into a heated discussion. I didn't think it was anything but a lively discussion, I even thought it was funny, so I was live tweeting it. Suddenly it turns ugly, and my brother starts yelling at my Mom about how she always calls his boyfriends just his friends. My Mom is clearly surprised and I could tell she was hurt. She goes upstairs, I can tell she's crying. Brother is fuming. Now I'm upset too. I'm very sensitive about Christmas (it SUCKED after parents got divorced) and it had just been in the last couple of years that I started to enjoy it again as an adult. So I confront him, told him it was not the right time to blow up at Mom and he absolutely loses it at me and ends up mocking me to my face when I tell him he's upsetting me. Doors are slammed. Next morning is very awkward, but there is some talking. I go home. Brother stays, my Mom tries to have a conversation with him about  what happened and he loses it on her too. He doesn't talk to me or my Mom for 6 months. I could have reached out and tried to mend things, but this has always been my role, and I'm sick of it, and frankly I think he was out of line.

So a few weeks ago, brother and I get together and have lunch and talk some things over. We seem to patch things up, I don't bring up how upset he made me at Christmas, he doesn't offer an apology. Whatever, as long as things are fine again. He does dress me down a little bit about the live-tweeting, saying it was wrong to do that over something so charged. I told him I had no idea at the time what was actually going on, but I apologize anyway. 

During the course of these 6 months brother has not had a job. Dad has been completely financially supporting him, which bothers me because I feel like my brother is unfairly using my Dad.

Cut to last Friday. He calls me 3 times over the course of several hours. I was hosting a party, but I call him back because 3 calls is scary to me and we agree to talk about it the next day. The next day I start panicking because brother has been suicidal before. Since he doesn't have a job, he tends to sleep into the afternoon, so I sweat by the phone until 1 PM when I finally get in touch with him. He explains that he contacted Mom saying he wanted to discuss his issues with her, and then found out from my Dad that she had told my Dad that he should stop financially supporting him. He's super pissed off and says that he tried to call her back and that she 'laughed at him and hung up the phone'. This makes me sort of suspicious because my Mom may be distant, but she's not an asshole. He tells me he's going to cut off all communication with her forever. This obviously upsets me, but I tell him I respect his decision if that's what he needs to do. He then tries to get me to tell him what Mom is thinking. I want to do this if it will help fix things, but it will also drag me further into the middle, so I tell him no, and explain to him that it's not healthy for me to take that stance. I advise him to talk to a therapist, because I am not a therapist. He has one (we both do, yay therapy!) and he tells me he can't see him until August. This is bullshit. If you're in crisis, any therapist worth their salt will find time for you. He keeps trying to get me to tell him what Mom is thinking and the conversation ends with us both upset.

Later in the day, I get a bunch of texts from him saying that Mom shut off his phone and he doesn't feel safe without a phone, and this is the last straw. Mom has been paying for his phone, even through the 6 months of zero contact. At this point I'm pretty frazzled, as I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that my brother and my Mom may never mend things. The, 'I don't feel safe' bit feels like a cry for attention. He has a car, he can go get a phone. I tell him this. He gets his phone sorted and I get a call later in the day. He's seething with anger at this point and starts listing off all of the evil he sees in Mom, how he thinks she's malicious and deliberately trying to ruin his life, and that he's never talking to her again. I tell him again that he can make that decision if he wants, but I don't start agreeing with him about our Mom. He hangs up on me. I'm totally fed up at this point so I shut my phone off for the rest of the day, and overnight. I'm pretty pissed off and upset that he thinks he can dump all this on me after not giving a shit about what was happening to me for 6 months, and after we had so recently started even just TALKING again.

Anger dissipates next morning and turns to worry when I see I had a completely monotone voice mail from him from that night telling me to call him ASAP. So I do the panic and wait by the phone for 1 PM to roll around, give him a call. Not suicidal, good. Brother gets mad at me because he feels like I'm not supporting him. I tell him again. I support you, but I'm not going to take sides against our Mom.

I finally talk to my Mom, and she's really upset, and really angry (we both are now) and suspicions from earlier are confirmed that little brother has been lying to me. She shut off his phone because he was texting and emailing her non-stop and threatening her. So much for 'never contacting her again'. So now I'm super pissed. Mom tends to try and find explanations for things, and she's decided that he's gone off the rails and he's paranoid schizophrenic. I don't think that's what's going on, but I haven't ruled out that he's having a manic episode. Probably should have mentioned this earlier but brother and I have both been 'unofficially' diagnosed as bipolar. I take meds for it and I've FINALLY gotten to a happy, stable place. He takes meds too, but I don't think they're the right ones.

Brother sends me this article that his friends wrote that he wants me to read that he thinks addresses all of Mom's evils. I read it. It just tells me that my brother drinks a lot and that Mom is not always as supportive as she could be. Brother has also decided Mom is a homophobe because of the fight rolling all the way back to Christmas. Through all this insanity however, brother never once told Mom after his initial Xmas eve outburst why he was mad. Mom is not a homophobe, they should totally have a conversation with a family therapist about my brother's sexuality, but she doesn't hate gay people.

I'm angry, and I don't want to talk to brother. He keeps calling and texting asking if I've read the article. I'm not ready to talk to him so I keep delaying. Finally brother and Dad call me 5 times in the span of an hour. I give in and call him. He proceeds to yell at me for not calling him back for 2 days while he's in crisis and he needs my support. I'm angry enough at this point to try and point out to him a few things that don't add up. Like demonizing Mom for shutting off the phone she was paying for when you start threatening her with it. He keeps rolling it back to 'so you're not supporting me'. I really want to tell him to just fuck off at this point, but there's always that little piece inside me that worries that he'll be suicidal again and then it will be my fault. So I don't.

After the call he calls my Dad and complains about how I'm not supporting him, and Dad starts calling me until I finally pick up the phone. Hooray! It's super drunk crying Dad! Thanks little brother! So I talk to my Dad until he calms down. He begs me to talk to my Mom and change her mind, and I'm so worn down at this point I placate him by telling him that everything will be fine, I will fix things.

And that's where things stand. I told my brother via text I would call him yesterday, but I couldn't do it. So I texted him and told him I would call him today. I don't know what to do. I don't support the way my brother is acting. I understand he's in pain, but I don't think there's anything healthy I can do to help him besides encourage him to talk to a professional. I don't want to act as a mediator anymore. Fuck I'm almost 30. I want to be able to live my own adult life, and I want my brother to start acting like an  adult and take responsibility for his own life, and what happens in it, instead of making these giant shit storms where he is the eye and he then sucks my whole family into them.

I moved in with this girl a few months ago. We'll call her Danielle I have an email stating how much I could pay and her stating she has a room available. I saw the room have text messages on what day I was moving in. We are in a state that recognizes verbal contacts for rentals. 

When I moved in Danielle said I could use the washer and dryer, dishwasher, and her Wi-Fi. Also her kitchen items eg. bowls, plates, pots and pans. She stated I could put my food in any of the cupboards. 

This past weekend Danielle asked if I had a dish in my room. She noticed they go missing and then come back. I told her I don't think so but I'll check. When I get to my room I notice the Wi-Fi no longer works. I asked her if she'd changed the password.  She stated she didn't know how to. At this point I know something is up so I tell her I didn't see a dish in my room to see if she decides to go in my room. I know it sounds childish. 

The next morning I'm leaving and she starts screaming about how I stole this dish from her she went into my room and found a gun. Took pictures and now she has PTSD and cannot live in a property with guns. She's in the military and started to threaten me that she'd call essentially her security officer to come search my room and she wasn't in the wrong since it's her place and her item in my room.  That I needed to leave that day but refused to give me back any amount of my rent. She also threatened to call the police. 

Anytime I'd try and say something she'd just scream at me. The gun I have doesn't even work. The gun was also removed immediately. I called my sister Brittany. She comes over and also tried telling her it's not legal to kick me out and if she wants me to leave she'd have to give me back half the rent. Finally Danielle agrees.

Brittany and I go back to my room to figure out a place for me to go and start packing my things. I texted Danielle and told her I will only except cash. No response.  Fast forward several hours. Brittany and me start to move furniture out. When we come back in Danielle starts yelling about how we need to remove our shoes, she's asked me to do this before. Usually I do however we are currently going back and forth. This sparked a yelling match between my sister and her. The entire evening Danielle was being emotionally abusive towards myself and Brittany. Finally we have enough go outside and call the police.

They come and advise I don't have to leave she is required to give me thirty days notice. I told him both sides of the story there isn't a point in hiding anything. Brittany, the police officer Tom and myself go into my apartment and Danielle is in the shower. I asked Tom to please wait outside because I know when she leaves the bathroom is usually in just a towel. 

I knock on the door for Danielle 3 times and no answer. Danielle is blasting hey music like normal. So Brittany pounds on the door. Danielle finally says that she doesn't want to talk to us. Brittany tells her several times that a police officer is hear. She couldn't hear us but also didn't turn the music down. 

Danielle comes out of the shower with her towel ready to talk to Tom. I told her that I asked him to wait outside so she could get dressed. She didn't like that and stormed off to her room. He basically told her that she cannot kick me out. She said since I only pay for the room then I am only allowed in there. Tom told her that I am allowed in common spaces. Also that she should have been up front about no guns in the home. Oh and what she did was trespassing

She tells me that she's actually moving out before the first she contacted the landlord and they said it would be fine. I told her if I leave before the first she'll be reimbursing me for the rest of the month. She agreed. 

The next day she said that I wasn't allowed to use her trash inside or outside and that I had to find another way to throw my things away. Then she took the bags I put on there and put it in the rain next to the trash can. 

The next morning I wake up to a text saying that she has moved all of my cupboard food and spices into plastic bags and I need to keep it in my room. 

Today I bought some cheap frozen food since I'm completely broke Danielle saw me put it in the freezer. Later that night I went to heat up some of it and her microwave was unplugged the one that came with the apartment is broken. So I turn the oven on and she then states that she's deep cleaning the oven. So I open and the wracks are gone. There is no cleaning solution in the oven nor is it turned on to be self cleaned.    I've attempted to record her conversions from my room but the microphone didn't pick up the conversion.  She also keeps threatening me with an mpo (military protective order).

12800,Non-Romantic,34vsi2,"My dad has the worst eating habits of anyone I know and I want him to get healthy.  What is concerning is how much coca-cola he drinks per day. When I say a lot I mean between 72-100 ounces a day.  He starts drinking them for breakfast then all throughout the day.  Imagine, having a soda with breakfast...

It is all he drinks to. We recently went on a roadtrip through the southwest where its pretty hot.  I would frequently offer him some of my water, and he would always refuse.  He would just stop at a gas station to get a large fountain coke.  Again, it wasn't just because we were on a vacation, he does this all the time.  

He also has horrible eating habits in general.  Fast food is 70% of what he eats.  If we were to eat at  home he makes food so unhealthily it might as well just be fast food. Currently I drove up to visit him for the night and as I sit here he is eating a whopper with cheese...

As you can imagine his health is in a horrible state.  He had one heart attack, probably about 70-80ibs over weight, and isnt confirmed, but I am pretty sure he is a type 2 diabetic.  His obesity causes many other problems.  

Like I said I want him to eat healthy and I would love to hear some advice or stories on how others have helped family members get fit.  I am a very active person, I exercise often and I wouldnt say I am the picture child of healthy eating, but I do make an effort for it. I always make it a point to eat healthy and get him out to do something active when I am around him just to try and set an example.  

What really breaks my heart is that I recently became a helicopter pilot and I cant take my dad out for a flight because he weighs too much for the helicopter to pick him up... I think obesity is going to kill my dad to be honest, he has a long line of people in his family who have lived past 90.  I hate to see him in such pain all the time.

12806,Non-Romantic,3541wj,"So things came to an end. I'm still upset about it, because I finally excepted that they weren't treating me like a true friend, and I do miss parts of our friendship, but I was being treated pretty poorly. I wish I could have tried to remain friends with one of them specifically, but I know better than to try to make them pick sides when I'M the third wheel. And either of them weren't really listening to my reasons why I ended things, anyway. I was too tired to make myself heard.

Right when we started hanging out in HS, one of their best friends had just dumped them, so I feel like I was just filling a hole, and still am right now. They always complained to me about her, and I never even got the chance to know her. They would talk about how she just Gave up on their friendship like it was nothing to her, and now they are saying similar things about me --But I really was being treated poorly and they just dismissed everything I wanted to say. (I didn't really care that I wasn't being heard at the time. I was just tired and done.)

One of the big reasons why they finally confronted their old friend about dumping them was because she didn't even say happy birthday to them on their birthdays. And it pissed them off something awful. (they were more pissed off at her, not giving them a happy birthday, than they were thankful of me, a newer friend, baking them both brownies, as I recall)

Now I'm in a similar situation. One of the girls lives with me and the other is coming up for the weekend to celebrate together, along with my OTHER (chill dude) roommate, because they are all living together next year, and *it is all three of their birthdays this weekend*. Fun times for me.

So, I already got their birthday presents MONTHS in advance, because I usually go overboard on gift-giving, and got them perfect gifts. All three of them are aware of this.

I was hoping to at least give my OTHER roommate his gift, because he's a little less involved in this and has been nice to my face at least. I take what I can get.

My two ex-friends have posted these quotes on their blogs about this ordeal:

When relationships fail it is usually because someone chooses not to show up for the battle.

(Which I disagree with, because I have had talks with them, and I feel like I've been battling this whole time, whereas they've been thinking no battle has been going on until now)

and

There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. 

So they are pretty much just done with me. Honestly I've overheard them saying some pretty cruel things about me in the past weeks and I don't think I'd want them back if they ever did apologize. I can't change that they fundamentally don't like who I am as a person.

But, I AM still roommates with one of them (for a few more months), and I've been super diplomatic to kill them with kindness and still let them use my things and been fine with getting kicked out of our shared grocery shopping because it makes them uncomfortable. (You can't change people's feelings) and more or less just tried to let everything roll off my shoulders and show them kindness. We've established an I'll be nice-ish to your face strictly roommates relationship.

So what do I do with these three gifts I've gotten each of them?

I'd feel bad if I gave our other roommate his and not everyone else's.

Also; I am going home for mother's day weekend, so I don't have to worry about my physical presence, just these damn gifts that they know I have. I feel like there is no winning.

However, she has a lot of struggles, all of which have just become more apparent and worrisome to me as I have gotten older. 


A little bit on me -I am 26, married and with a child, looking to buy a house and change careers, graduating school... basically - my life is changing a lot right now.


My mother is awesome. She currently lives in a house that was my father's (he passed several years ago) with my 24 yr old sister (who is very preoccupied with school and two jobs). I hate to say things that can be construed negatively about my mom...but there are some sad truths. She is very much like the main character on Strangers with Candy if anyone can get that reference. She is extremely socially awkward, has hygiene issues, is very secluded, and has some very slight brain damage/mental retardation (I believe, honestly, from drug use earlier in life.). She is extremely out of shape (cancer 5 years ago). She is very outgoing and very friendly, but most people are put off by her because she is that awkward type of outgoing. She has no filter, no concept of what is appropriate in any given situation, and just in general has issues. She can make friends but they usually only stick around for a short period of time. She also has a very deep understanding of this. She knows she is a social outcast. She tells me about how friendly she is with neighbors, but then has said she knowingly exaggerates her friendships because it makes her feel good like she has friends when she truly doesn't. It breaks my heart. I try to help her as much as I can. I have taken her clothes shopping and gotten her hair, makeup, and nails done for her multiple times so she can seem more presentable but every time I do, the clothes I buy sit in the closet and she lets her appearance go. I gently try to explain to her why things she says can be construed wrong and how to be socially appropriate, but it upsets her and it doesn't stick with her. She is upset that my in-laws do not want to be friendly towards her (they are cordial, but she is awkward to them, so I cant blame them). They are close in age, but my in-laws are active, healthy, and very socially adept... very much the opposite of my mother. Like most others, they find her strange and awkward.


It is making me incredibly sad. I am trying to help but I am at my wits end. She stays cooped up in her room all day and sleeps and watches TV an unhealthy amount. She has always been depressed and sees a therapist constantly and is on medication - so that is all covered.


I have encouraged her to go to senior classes and to do volunteer work, but because of her medical conditions, most volunteer organizations and opportunities do not want her anyways as she would be more of a burden than a help. She says she will try some seniors classes, but she is upset because at 57 she does not really view herself as a senior. She has slight mental retardation but would be extremely offended if I ever suggested groups with other people with similar conditions. 


I realize her case is very particular, but I am looking for any sort of ideas, suggestions, help for organizations or anything that can help socialize people who are not exactly seniors but also not exactly able to function as well as a young person in society. 

Any help or support is greatly appreciated. 



   
**tl;dr**: My mother has social awkwardness issues and is not able to make friends. I need to help her and keep her active, but it is hard to do with maintaining my own changing life at the moment.

12811,Non-Romantic,25nn35,"Okay. Where to begin. Probably going to be a wall of text because I'm in a venting mood. My husband and I (25/m, 24/f) have been experiencing a lot of problems with a woman (60's/f) who lives in the apartment directly below us. She gets upset with us over things that could be really small if she spoke to us directly or to the landlord if she wasn't comfortable speaking with us and was willing to compromise, but she does not. Instead, she takes it out on us passive aggressively and drags it out for months. 


After we first moved in (Aug 2012) she began banging on the ceiling whenever she felt we were being too loud. Mind you this was never when we were watching the tv or playing music (because we try to be cognizant of our neighbors and keep the volume low as well as putting blankets beneath the speakers to further block sound). She would bang when things happened liked I'm cooking and accidentally drop a metal can on the floor. Yes I realize that is probably a bit loud, but it was one quick noise and it was an accident. This would be a reason for her to start banging on the ceiling. After almost a year of this we got fed up and my husband went downstairs to speak with her and to ask her to please refrain from banging on the ceiling. She was extremely startled that we spoke to her, made some ridiculous claims about us stomping around, but mostly stopped banging on the ceiling after this. Yay.

Something that really concerns me is that she seems to be getting forgetful, or at least that is what I attribute this next behavior to. A few times when we are quietly sitting in our living room we have heard a weird scraping noise on the door. We've looked through the peephole to find her trying to use her keys in our door! When this happens we let her know that this is our apartment and to please stop trying to get in. She usually mumbles something and then walks away quickly.


She does a hundred other little passive aggressive things but I won't go into those details. But the straw that broke the camel's back for us is that for the last two months she has been banging on her windows and does so upwards of a dozen times a day. Whenever she bangs on her windows (which we can hear very clearly in our apartment) we look outside but all we can see are birds and squirrels doing bird and squirrel things. This seemed odd to us but we left it alone. But over time, it got incredibly annoying. Spend a quiet Saturday reading on the couch with a record playing and suddenly BANG BANG BANG on the windows. Last Friday, my husband was home in the afternoon and got fed up after an very extensive window pounding session. He went downstairs and asked her why she was banging on the windows all the time. Well, it turns out it is the squirrels and birds she is banging on the window at. Why? Because I have bird feeders on my balcony and she hates them. She hates birds, she doesn't understand why anyone would like them, and the squirrels are going to climb on her window screens and its our fault. She also said some other insulting, accusatory things (like why my spouse was home on a weekday afternoon, none of her business) and was extremely hostile but the thing that really upset me is that she demanded we get rid of our bird feeders and that we needed to listen to her because she is older then us. What a cop out excuse. My husband managed to keep his cool, but it was close.


So I guess my question is, what can we do to lessen the tension without just giving in to her demands? After this latest incident my husband called our landlord and left a message but he never returned our call and seems to be avoiding us, so it doesn't look like we will get much help from that direction. Also, our maintenance guy is in his 70's and is sweethearts with this woman. Generally he's very nice to us and polite but he's begun giving us dirty looks and nailed wood over her window to deter squirrels (wut?). He does whatever she says and it makes me nervous that he has a master key. I'm willing to come to compromises, if she really thinks squirrels will damage her screens I can switch to safflower seeds because I've heard squirrels don't care for them. But she seems pretty unwilling to compromise and just wants it her way.

12815,Non-Romantic,1w95la,"I [M/27] have a 6-year-old daughter with my ex-girlfriend, Tina [F/23]. Her and I have been pretty civil the entire time. She has another kid with another guy.

I also have a best friend, Chris [M/29]. We've known each other since we were little. He's kind of a thug type guy who makes his money selling weed, but he earns a decent income and takes care of his son. Him and I would take a bullet for each other. Anything one of us asks, the other one does without question. We've both risked a lot of prison time and a lot of personal safety for each other. If he won a million dollars, he'd probably give me half.

But! The guy is a sex addict. We both have said that the mothers of our kids are off limit to friends. You just don't do that. Ex-girlfriends, fine. Other girls we've slept with, fine. But not the mothers of our children.

Fast forward to six months ago, my daughter's mom Tina was being harassed by her other child's father. He went so far as to break into her house and physically assault her. I don't know the details of the assault, but he was arrested for assault. Tina called my mom and told her.

My mom and Tina didn't want me to find out about it. They know that I hate the guy and would go into a state of rage and physically beat him. They wanted to prevent that because I'm almost done with school and it could stop me from being an educator for the rest of my life, and also because I'm under contract as a professional MMA fighter and the promoter who throws the fights wouldn't have anything to do with me anymore if I attacked someone.

Now, six months later, my daughter's mom and I were arguing about something and Chris, my best friend, came up in conversation, and I defended how good of a friend he is. She said He isn't as good of a friend as you think he is and told me about the whole scenario. But, after my Mom talked to Chris, Chris contacted Tina on Facebook and said they should meet up and talk. There was no reason for them to meet up. They could have just communicated on Facebook. She told me that when they met up, Chris asked her to go drink beers with him and take her truck off-roading.

Again, we have both made it very clear that baby mamas are off limit. This whole time, Chris concealed that whole encounter from me. Months later, I'm not going to go in a fit of rage over the incident, so he could have told me at any time. And, the people not wanting me to know about it were just my mom and Tina --- Chris would have told me. He would never hide anything like that.

But, he hid it, and I know it's because of him inviting Tina out. He was thinking If I tell Tyler, he might get mad at Tina for meeting up with me, and she might blab about me asking her out.

Tina has no reason to lie to met about that. Chris is a sex addict and does that type of stuff to his other friends. I'm very certain that Tina was telling the truth.

Is that breach in trust worth ending a friendship over? I don't believe that they ever did anything (though it is possible), but he attempted it, so that's just as bad as doing it in my opinion. I now know that he would in fact sleep with her if he had the chance. We both know how important it is to each other that we DON'T do that.

I confronted him. He denied it. The guy is so loyal in every other way. I'm just not sure what to do. I don't really have many other friends, and certainly no other friends that would take a bullet for me. But he is a sex addict so I think that shuts down his loyalty part of his brain and the idea of sleeping with the forbidden girl kicks in.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I just don't know what to do.

12846,Non-Romantic,2i766r,"I live with some guys at college and various times now I have heard from my closest friend who is there for most conversations that a lot of the guys in the house think that I'm too serious, I can't take a joke, and that I get too sensitive. This all comes from the fact that when they crack some jokes that I sometimes don't like, I let them know. This then sometimes leads to some arguments starting with Dude, chill, it's just a joke and I let them know that I am chill but that I do not appreciate the joke.

I am pledging a fraternity at the moment so the jokes often involve calling me pledge and saying when are you going to go elephant walk, pledge and when does the house need to be cleaned, pledge. First few times it was funny, but after a while I got sick of it. I get enough shit from the pledge masters and so when I get home I don't want to hear anymore of it, but to them, it's all fun and jokes and I should lighten up. Maybe I should, but it still bothers me

Part of me thinks that maybe I could loosen up a bit, but the other part of me thinks that I shouldn't tolerate jokes from my friends that I don't like just so they think I'm not serious. If I should in fact loosen up, I am not too sure how to not let the jokes get to me, and on the other end, perhaps there is a better way to let them know that I don't appreciate said jokes.

I am a young boy who hails from Indonesia. I am currently 15 and about to turn 16 in about 4 days. 

Recently, I've discovered that my mother is possibly having an affair. I found out through two ways:
1) As I'm still within Senior High, I've not gotten my license and cannot go anywhere by myself. During these trips home sometimes I can hear my mother being in a call with someone whose voice I do not recognize. She also speaks to this person in a flirtatious nature that's never used with my father. Her word choices also differ. After the calls she would sometimes also call my father and the difference is rather noticeable. One time I've also taken the calls to my home and this one man after I inquire the origin of the call states a name that is not my father seeking my mother. I hand the phone over to her and out comes the flirtatious and soft, different nature that i recognize from the calls in the journey from school to home (it's about 30 km).

2) Being the only member of my family that is adept on tech I also sometimes troubleshoot the troubles my parents have with their gadgets. Several times I've been asked to help my mother with her phone and I took the liberty of violating her privacy and checking some of her private messages after incidents from point 1). I checked the one name that i recognize as being the caller origin and the name she frequently text to usually in long lines and there I have it. Remarks said back and forth such as 'you're my number one' or 'honey' or 'love' that was mutual but in Indonesia, our mother tongue. 

I am certain of my findings but uncertain of what I should do. Honestly I plan on not saying a word to anyone but you internet citizens to get advice. Within 2 years when I graduate from Senior High, I will possibly go to Uni in the land of guns yet no kinder eggs, the US, where I will be free to concentrate on my studies and not loyalty issues. I want to keep everything to myself and let things happen as they should, naturally. It's less burden for me and the rest of my family. I'm not ready to confront her about it and i may never will if it leaves a disastrous impact.

He is an okay friend on his own, but whenever we're in company he will basically try to one-up everything anyone says and insult and bad mouth anyone near him, attempting to cause drama. He will constantly talk bad about me behind my back to my other friends who will tell me straight away. 


It was funny to put up with during my teens, but now I just feel sick and tired of his company, he refuses to grow up and constantly needs attention. He even followed me on dates, I'm close to being sure he is obsessed with me.

12879,Non-Romantic,2i70fr,"**My sister is financially irresponsible.**  Any time she gets money, she spends it foolishly. For example, a couple of months ago she got several thousand dollars. We tried to convince her to save the money for a rainy day, but instead she spent it on a vacation, video game system and new cell phone.  

**Now her car has broken down, and she has no money to fix it. She asked me to lend her the money, but I don't want to keep enabling her.** We have been down this road before and she has never paid me back. I know that every time I lend her money, I enable her and she doesn't learn any kind of lesson about her finances. 

**She tried to guilt me into it by saying she has no way to get her daughter to school.  In response, I bought her daughter a school bus pass. It cost about $400.**  If her daughter needs to go to school early / leave late she can call me and I will drive her. If I am not available I will send a car service.  If my niece needs to go to a doctor's appointment or anything like that, I'll gladly take her.

As for my sister, her job is within a mile of their apartment. A grocery store is only 3 blocks away.  She is overweight but has no health issues that would prevent her from walking a mile.  I know it's not fun, but that's life.

**My sister is angry because I spent more on a bus pass (around $400) than it would cost to fix her car (around $300).**  She feels she has a right to decide how money is spent on her and her daughter, and if she wants that money to go toward her car instead of the bus pass, I'm being unreasonable to say no. I tried to explain that I am tired of bailing her out of constant financial problems and want her to start learning how to prioritize. She says that her finances are none of my business - although I think they are when she expects me to contribute to them, but I digress.

**Meanwhile, our mom also wants me to just give my sister the money.** Mom knows I want to break this cycle, and she agrees that it's needed, BUT she is tired of hearing my sister complain about this. My sister is also constantly asking to use Mom's car to get to work/stores because my sister says she shouldn't have to walk to work, and walking to the grocery store is just plain embarrassing.

**I can easily afford to fix her car.** In the full scope of my finances, $300 to fix a car is nothing, which is why my sister/mom think I should just do it.  My husband and I make six figures and ample savings, so they know I can afford it easily.  BUT it's the principle of the issue - I don't want to bail her out.

**Am I being unfair?  Should I just give her the money, or should I stick to my guns?**

12885,Non-Romantic,2i0wf1,"About two years ago I started seeing a concierge doctor who I ended up getting along really well with. I have an unusual disease that's hard to find doctors who will be knowledgable about the condition--and even though this doctor wasn't, he was very open to researching and reaching out to other experts. 


I pay a retainer plus co-pays each time I visit. It's somewhat expensive, but worth it seeing as I feel no other doctor will do the grunt work that he does for me and my condition. I can't stress how incredibly difficult it has been to find doctors like this--who work the hours he does and make themselves so available to me.


Several months after being a patient, the doctor started requesting me to work with him on marketing his practice. This is what I do for a living and I mostly work in healthcare, so it seemed an obvious choice. BUT, I actually declined 2-3 times for fear that it might complicate the relationship. In the end, I gave in an decided to begin a working relationship.


From the get-go, his wife (F60's) and office manager disagreed with almost every marketing decision I made. She didn't like change and the doctor didn't want to put up a fight on anything, so the only thing to do was to move on to the next project.


This pattern has been continuing for over a year now. It's frustrating, but at  the same time we managed to get a few things done, and I added MANY patients to his practice through my work. He seemed satisfied and I was being paid well for my time.


During this time there were a lot of staffing changes. It's a small office but they switched out their two employees a lot. I realized that this was because the office manager/wife was constantly berating employees, belittling them--I witnessed many employees cry and eventually get run out of the office. Although she never approved of my work choices, she had yet to treat me in the same way.


Fast forward to about two months ago--she decided that she no longer wanted me to submit invoices by email. She just wanted me to ask for my check. Which was strange--but I went along with it. Everytime I asked for my check though she'd be like Well, it's not like I have it on me.


So I started asking for my check earlier, and let her know when she needed to have it. Then last week I asked for my check and she's like Well, I need an invoice! You can't just ask for a check!


I actually just laughed at her and was like, alright, I'll print you out an invoice from now on.


During this time she was heavily berating the secretary who looked like she was about to crack all the time.


Then the shit absolutely hit the fan. I came in this morning AS A PATIENT for a weekly treatment I get in the office.  There was another patient (one who I had referred to the practice) waiting in the waiting room, a nurse took her back just as I was going back to my exam room.


We exchanged hellos and strange looks as we overheard a conversation behind the counter. The wife and the secretary where in a heated argument. The wife was saying how the secretary couldn't do anything right and she didn't understand why such simple tasks were so hard for her. The secretary was crying, hysterically. The nurse quickly ushered us into our separate exam rooms but we could overhear the entire fight what with the office's paper-thin walls.


They argued at the top of their voices for a half an hour. I was so disgusted. As a patient it made me feel incredibly awkward! As their marketing director, and someone who had referred the other patient in the office--I was humiliated! How unprofessional.


The fight was escalating so I actually left my exam room and interrupted them saying, What are you thinking? There are patients here. We can hear every word you're saying! Do you know how awkward that makes someone feel? And how unprofessional this is? This is insane. You can't fight like this at the office. It's too public.


I didn't even know you were here, said the wife.


Well, if you hadn't been screaming, you would have heard me come in. I said. Then I marched back to my exam room.


They continued to fight. Finally the doctor walked into the office for the morning and I pulled him aside. You need to take care of this. This is ridiculous. There are other patients here and this is so awkward and humiliating!


He pulled the two of them back into his back office and then the THREE of them started screaming (and of course, we could hear again every word.)


I grabbed my things and told the nurse I was leaving and going to an urgent clinic, to let them know I was disgusted by their behavior and that they should give me a call when they can get it together. I then texted the patient I had referred and apologized for how unprofessional the rest of the office had been.


But now what? I'm on the verge of quitting. I don't want to be the next victim of her boredom/insanity/whatever. And I don't think the doctor will stick up for me. Should I stay as a patient and avoid the wife? Or avoid this office and relationships altogether? Remember, this doctor is truly ONE OF A KIND when it comes to my condition. It would be very hard to replace him!

There, we figured out some ways to help her, being the first step to take her with a full-time psychologist so we can have a diagnosis.

The thing here is: I moved out my father's last october and had gone from Low Contact to No Contact at all, but she still lives with him and, although I wouldn't care about paying this terapy, somehow I think is his responsability to take care of it.

Also, I found out that most of the things that troubles my sister have to do with issues within her home, so I think that no terapy will be good enough if she keeps coming back to an unhealthy environment, that's why I think all of us (my other 2 siblings as well) should get involved.

While I'm not saying he was always the perfect dad to us, he none-the-less managed to raise a bunch of little hellions on his own and make us into decent, hardworking men. I always knew I could call on him and he'd do anything to help me, no matter what the problem was. He did massive amounts of charity work, was a pillar in the community, and everyone is taking the loss very hard.

My siblings and I are all adopted, with the exception of my youngest brother Danny [7], who is my father's biological son. His mother is not in the picture. All of us deal with abandonment issues and similar problems. My grandmother is very old, frail, and is in a care facility for dementia. My dad was an only child.

As the oldest and the responsible one, I took over planning the funeral, dealing with the lawyers, organizing his affairs, and managing the business (my dad was wealthy, so his estate is extra complicated.) My brother Jackson [22] helps as best he can, but he's got a lot of anger issues and always had a rather explosive relationship with Dad so he's in a really bad headspace right now. Tom [18] graduated from high school three weeks ago. Danny is obviously way too young to be dealing with any of this.

I'm also Tom and Danny's guardian. Danny has been more or less sleeping in my bed since the funeral, and Tom ends up there more often than not as well. They're terrified something's going to happen to me next. They're receiving counseling, but this paranoia has not died down. Jackson has been spending a lot of time on my couch. They've always looked up to me, and I've been their emotional anchor. I'm terrified of letting them down.

I rarely have a moment to myself. If I'm not at work, I'm at my father's house and my brothers are never far away, even when I'm working out or trying to zone out on the computer. I tried to sort through my dad's room, but I'll see a stupid ugly sweater we gave him for Christmas or smell his cologne and I just break down. I'm full of rage – at the drunk driver for living, at Dad for leaving us, at myself for feeling this way – and despair at the fact that my dad, the man I looked up to and aspired to be, will never see his sons get married or have kids or become as successful as him. People keep calling me about setting up foundations and funds in his honor, or about some tiny little asset, or they're some obscure relative looking for some cash.

I feel like I haven't slept since the night of the crash. I'm on call 24/7. I just want to crawl into my bed and scream until my vocal chords are shot, but I can't. My friends dragged me out of the house once, and I spent the whole time worrying if Danny was going to have a meltdown or Tom was going to have a panic attack, even though Jackson was there.

Just to be clear, I don't personally make non-PC jokes that could offend, as I know these things can get out of hand at a workplace, and I'd hate for a flippant joke to risk my career. I can't say my colleagues all think this way.

There's one man on the team who was the butt of all jokes for a while, again nothing nasty or out-of-line, he's now left for another job, but I said to him before he left I bet you won't miss the guys ripping into you, he then used a completely inappropriate and offensive metaphor to desribe how they treated him I treat it like rape, you know what they say, if you're getting raped don't fight it just enjoy it. Basically be meant he doesn't let the teasing bother him, he allows it to happen and enjoys the banter however that was such a horrible way of saying it we were all shocked and appalled at what he'd said and he apologised, and that was fine, it was just poor phrasing, not nice, but he didn't mean anything by it.

I have never met any of her bridesmaids, or the maid of honor since I was out of town the weekend they went dress shopping for the bride, and bridesmaid dresses. Tho, we have been talking over group text. There are apparently a total of 3 bridesmaids, and  maid of honor. Everyone wanted to keep the expenses low, so opted to stay in the city for the bachelorette party. The MOH asked $200 from everyone to cover the costs, and said that any leftover money would be sent back.


Before the bachelorette party, she sent out a timeline of the event for the night over text. I have no idea what my $200 went towards, so I sent her a personal text asking about it. 

She sent me a picture of two sticky notes with these notes:

* Hotel: $250


* Decoration: $45+snacks

* Breakfast: ? $


* Taxi/Uber: $60


* TOTAL: $865 (reminder ALL extra cash will be given back)


Cue to the day of the event. MOH was not present for the massage because of an emergency. Another girl was there who had not pitched in any money (18 y/o sister to Bridesmaid A). After the massage, MOH met up with us, and we all chilled in the hotel room. It was decorated, and she had bought drinks/snacks. Bride, and Bridesmaid B do not drink, so there was a lot of extra booze. We went for dinner which was $20-25 tops with tip for the bride. Since 18 y/o was too young to go out to bars/strip club, she stayed at the hotel after that. MOH, and I drove my car to the first bar. The bride had lost her ID, so we had to stay in that one bar. There was no cover charge. We enjoyed ourselves a lot. I wasn't able to stay with them overnight because of some legal work the next day.


I assume they went out for breakfast the next day.

Our gang told her that she's welcome to have the guy hangout with us - he never does. In fact, he goes out of his way to avoid us, which was weird because he usually had lunch with us when they were just friends. This is super obvious because we all work in the same office. 

Then the stories start. I won't post everything here as there's enough material for a daytime soap opera, but, god, if they weren't the most vexing things to hear. 

Guy visits his baby mommy (BM from now on) in jail weekly to bring groceries. My friend gets jealous and confronts him about his feelings for the girl and their relationship status. Friend tells me that the guy loves her but he wants a family for his baby which is why he intends to stay with the girl when she gets out. BUT, he assures her that he and BM would separate eventually because they're not compatible anyway.

So, my friend, in an episode of brain farts, stays with him. She would complain to me that they rarely go on dates because he's always broke (despite his salary being double ours) as, apparently, he is trying to scrunge up money to pay for what BM stole. Okay, fine, he's being a helpful chap. He refuses to let her pay for anything when they're together, so that then limits the dates.

Friend also tells me that he would always give him a hard time whenever she goes out drinking or even just dinner/movies with me or other friends. He also tells her off when she requests anything after asking her what she wants because his budget is depleted. He keeps throwing the fact that she grew up privileged in her face. My friend also tells me that he thinks she wouldnt be a good mother because of how she is and that she has the crazies in her genes (her mom is schizophrenic). He's also the company IT and thus he would hold her requests and not work on them whenever they have a fight.

All that and more while he continues to bang her. So, here we are. Apparently, she's pregnant. This is the third time, that i know of, mind you. She's afraid to lose the baby again as she lost the first two. It's part her state of mind and her being a workaholic, i suppose. She told me that he blamed her and accussed her of killing the second baby. A few months after he would tell her that all his love and all his time is only for his baby and he doesnt have room for anyone else. She then works even harder and intends to raise this one on her own.

Now, caveat, everything you've read are all secondhand info from my friend. She has the tendency to be a bit of a drama queen and overthinking people's actions. She's also told me she broke up with him and hid the fact that they're back together til either i find out about it or she cant hold it in anymore. She also won't use birth control. She says hormones are affecting her moods - fsir enough. How about condoms? No, he doesnt like how they feel.

I've tried it the nice way, i tried it the asshole way and had a huge fight with her, and still she stays with him. It's an awful thought to have about a friend, but I have the sinking feeling that she is intentionally trying to get pregnant to get him to commit with her.

Reddit, i have no idea how to help her anymore. Should i confront the guy? I dont work there anymore, but my girlfriend does so i have an excuse to be in the office. Things are getting way out of whack. Ugh. She just messaged me that she's falling in to depression too.

Shes been in a more mentally abusive relationship with my dad and younger brother (more so younger brother than my dad...its pretty disgusting and complicated to explain). She recently had both her parents die this year and the family dog she was closest to. Her and I have been buddy buddy, I'm really close to my mom, but I'm only here 1/4 of the year the rest I'm in college or interning in D.C (leave next weekend). My older brother is here as well, but hes not very helpful and is moving to California this summer. I actually had a really good internship offer out in Seattle but turned it down so I could stay close to home in D.C instead with a D.C company (family lives like an hour from D.C...and truth be told I'd love to see Seattle or the Bay Area but I'll probably end up living and staying in D.C) so I could still see her and spend time with her.   

Above all though, I am really scared for her mental health. I think she is definitely depressed, but I can't get her to see a counselor. I spend time with her while I am here, she goes on cheap weekend vacations a lot because she likes to travel. Though I'm not sure what to do to help her. I really worry for her. Shes also not very healthy physically as well, again I've tried to get her to do Yoga or walk with me when I jog but she won't. She is a great mom, has been around for my brothers and I our whole lives, and seems to only do for other people...but I'm really worried for her.

While it was happening I noticed her barely eating and working out for hours at a time and tweeted about it on my private account (only my very, very close friends follow me + my cousin whom I'm also incredibly close with).

Here's an exact transcription of what I said (posted on January 5th)

1. More than a little worried about my sister. She eats practically nothing and works out for hours every day.
2.every compliment she gets on how she looks just fuels her fucked up delusions that being thin = being healthy
3.for supper she had a quarter of an avocado and a 1.5 tablespoons of meat sauce. for lunch and breakfast she has scrambled egg whites
4.if you express concern for how little she's eating and how QUICKLY she lost weight she gets defensive and snaps at us to mind our business

She called me today telling me that she was very hurt by this and that I had no right and that she should post on her, non-private w/ over 300 friends, facebook that I'm dating a girl. When I told her it's not the same thing at all she didn't agree and we went back and forth until I hung up on her.

No one but my immediate family + very, very close friends know this. The rest of my family is very traditional and I live in a close-knit community where everyone knows each other. I'm kind of freaking out and don't know what to do or say

Even more difficult is that my two roommates whom I introduced to her are still really good friends with her.  One of them in particular still talks with her regularly and despite them saying they don't talk about me I don't really believe it (she always knows when i've been with my ex, she slips up and lets out little details that I had told my ex and no one else).  Then the other day they were invited to a dinner party at my exes house that i obviously was not invited to.  They knew I was upset about it but still went anyway leaving me home alone by myself, which personally I just thought was a shitty thing to do to a friend.  I'm really struggling with them remaining such close friends with her while I'm trying to move on.  I feel like they are providing my ex with this one-sided mirror view into my life that I don't have with her and I feel like I can't be myself in my own home.  I've brought it up that it makes me uncomfortable and they tend to get really defensive.  I even got into a yelling match with one of them the other night because she convinced me to go hang out at a bar with our friends and just didn't tell me all my exes friends were going to be there too.  Obviously I had a shitty night and left and when I told her how mad I was about it she came home screaming at me.  Obviously it's putting a huge strain on our friendship and my living situation.  I don't want to tell them not to be friends with her anymore because it just seems like a shitty thing to do, to tell people they can't be friends with someone, but it is making me really uncomfortable in my own home.

12959,Non-Romantic,20u2u8,"My father is divorced with 5 children from his first marriage ranging from me to my youngest brother who is 12. He started dating a woman he met while meeting a group for people who have left the Mormon church. They've been dating for about a year and have been living together for a few months now.

I haven't had a particular problem with the girlfriend (I'll refer to her as Anne) and generally really like her. She works with children with behavioral problems, is very intelligent, and has been easy to talk to. Most of my experiences with her have been around just her and my father up until a week ago when my father's parents came to visit from out of state. 

We were all invited over to dinner at my father and Anne's apartment and we having a pretty good time. The younger kids were mostly quiet, but my brother is a very chatty kid who loves history and is very interested in World War II. 

My grandfather starts talking about a special he saw about the war and my brother chimes in with some facts about a scientist that was involved that he had recently learned in school. Anne immediately chimed in, That is a lie! Don't you dare say that without proof! Where is your proof? This shocked me quite a bit because 
1) My brother is 12, he just wants to contribute to conversation
2) I've never seen Anne speak up like that before

She continued to do this for the rest of the night to just about everything that my brother said. My dad would reassure my brother that he just needed to make sure what he was saying was true. 

What I'm wondering is if this is a concern I should bring up to my father or not. I really don't like the way that Anne handled that at all and it really made me think very differently of her. Is this realistic to expect of a 12 year old? Should I say anything?

12968,Non-Romantic,2whmol,"So to preface, I've never posted here, so forgive me if I missed a piece of etiquette.

Background on me: I am more of a solitary guy. Not really forced unto me by fate or anything, but I just like to be alone most of the time. That doesn't mean that I have no friends, I have many a good friend. Have not had any success to talk about concerning girls. I guess that's because I don't really talk to girls other than for school related matters. I'd rather play a good videogame and talk to online friends over going outside and doing things with real-life friends. I almost never text/call people other than my mom or brothers. At least until I met this girl. 

There's this girl I met online two weeks ago, and have since texted and chatted on the phone frequently.  I started talking to her due to having a common interest (not relevant to this post)  and hit it off real quick. So we just chat about general things that high schoolers might talk about. Here is where the problem starts to emerge; she tells me that she takes drugs and self harms to escape from her abusive family and apathetic friends. She is suicidal a lot (I was frightened to hear this, to say the least. Don't worry, she has hotline numbers (at least I hope she will use them)). She calls me teary-sounding and tells me she's fine and to not worry about her. I can't help to not worry about this, because suicide is very serious. She falls asleep eventually, and I think I made her feel a bit better. 

Maybe a few days or so later, the to-be-expected-from-adolescents sex-related topics comes up. She is characteristically open about everything, so this was a cakewalk for her to talk about her preferences and experiences (or lack thereof, she is a virgin, other than being raped when she was younger (she has emotional problems and mental problems)). Due to her low self esteem, she thinks that no one will want to have sex with her until she is middle aged. She says that she cannot believe the fact that I am still a virgin, even though she thinks I'm pretty attractive, which does not help her self image. 

So the obligatory phone sex ensues, and she really likes how that worked out, but I'm regretful due to having lost an amount of self control. This happens two more times, with varying amounts of regret on my side (that's less important, but I just want to give more details, rather than less). 

At this point, it's pretty obvious that she's rather smitten by me (she even said so just yesterday). But I still do not feel anything towards her. This is even worse when I have to console her when she calls me, crying about how her only good friend (other than me) has started to ignore her for the second time, and has opened up some previously closed cuts she's made on her hips. I tell her that there are people that actually do care for her, and that if she committed suicide, they would be shocked beyond belief. She was more suicidal than ever, just last night. 

My problem is that I just don't really like her more than an acquaintance. I fear that I really screwed myself over by engaging in phone sex and by getting her closer to me. 

Now this brings me to my question. How do I tell her to back off, and cut the phone sex, without hurting her? Or how do I cut contact completely, and return to my solitary lifestyle? At this point I think there's going to be some tears no matter what I do.

Sorry for the book, but I think it would help you, kind redditors. 

Oh and I don't know if this should be flaired as non-romantic or dating but it's kinda something in the middle.

12971,Non-Romantic,2e5jmq,"This all happened less than 4 hours ago so sorry if it is all over the place, but I would like some opinions/advice...
My fiance and I are/were in the process of buying a house... 38 days till we were supposed to move in to be exact.
Here are the facts: -The house we are/were buying is new construction, in our price range, nice area, etc.... and connects to his parents property. -We were willing to not have everything on our list to live so close to his parents bc family is a big deal. -We didn't look at any other houses-even thought I strongly suggested that we should. -His parents gave us the downpayment.
My fiance has a sister (younger than both of us-22) who does not have a job, is still in school-becoming a teacher-graduates next may, and has never known what work is... She is the apple of their parent's eye and gets everything she wants. She drives a fucking camero for christ's sake.
The get a monthly allowance AKA about 1k a month from their parents each. She saved the money and he did not. She has enough for a downpayment on a house, but still no job.
For the past year or so, we have been trying to get a house saving all the money we could, making sacrifices, busting our asses ... you get the picture to be able to afford a house. As well as trying to pay for a wedding....but that's a different story.
So as stated above, we were willing to live without some of the must haves on our list to be so close to his parents- who are great 99% of the time. 1 being a back yard... the house we were looking at opens up onto their property which is a fuckton of yard with no upkeep.
We found out YESTERDAY that we officially got approved and all we had left to do was get an appraisal on the house.Woo. We were getting a house..
Today, his sister and parents tell him that they are in contract on a house for her that their dad had to cosign on and will be paying the note on. The house is TWO FUCKING DOORS AWAY from us... Not sure if you can tell, but I am quite a bit mad. They intentionally hid this from us.
Wait, there is more. On top of not letting us be happy and not being happy for their son, she is set to close 11 days after us. 11 DAYS!! For real, can't even let my fiance be happy for once. She has to take his shining moment to be all about her.
So he's really upset that I am no longer willing to sign papers on that house (going to look into the legal ramifications of that in the morning). On top of that, his parents are going to be upset. So the people he cares most about are all going to be upset and he/we still won't have a house.... or a place to live for that matter.
I want more than anything to be ok with it, but I'm not and I can't pretend to be nor can I sign on a loan for a house that I have no interest in owning anymore.
I am not sure what to do. Either way 2 people lose. It's a hard place to be. Any advice/Comments are welcome.

She often takes her baked goods to work and bakes a lot for friends/some family. Her cakes rival the ones you would see out of a baking magazine.

However, the problem is that my chain smoking grandmother [60F] lives with her and also smokes in the house. I know my mother isn't holding a cigarette in one hand and stirring cake batter with another but I (and my husband [25M]) can literally smell and taste the ash in her goodies. 

Her baked goods haven't always had this issue. It may have started when my grandmother started smoking in the house. I think my mother goes outside to smoke but I am unsure since I live in a different state and only see her every so often when she comes to visit and brings goodies.

I'm also the eldest and the only girl and still not married.  

I now live about 2 hours away from them. I'm working on my second college degree (with my parent's help), and I'm living in a big old house that I share with 5 other people who are my age. Half grad students, half young professionals. We're a pretty responsible group, keep the house clean, don't get into any major troubles etc. My boyfriend is a PhD student who lives about a mile north. We've been dating for about a year and a half.

This summer my boyfriend is planning on running a triathalon down in Virginia. It's about a 12 hour drive to get down there, but I'm really excited! I love road trips and I love watching him race. 

I told my mom about the trip this afternoon, and she just fell silent. He actual response after a minute was I don't know what to say. I asked her what was bothering her, and she couldn't really say even though I had a pretty good idea of what it was. After probing a little bit more (mom, I need you to be more explicit) she said she was worried about my emotional well being and that a sexual relationship is a part of an emotional relationship. .....okay mom. 

I told her that I have been very clear about my expectations for this relationship with my boyfriend, and that he has done nothing but be respectful of them, which I guess made her a bit happier. I also told her that we'd most likely be staying with his parents for one night, and a friend of his for another, which also seemed to help. 

I've been sexually active for the past 10 years. -.- 

Now I'm left with so many concerns. I don't want my parents to disapprove of me or my significant other. I've always wanted to be dating someone who they love like a son, the way they love my sisters-in-law.  I've always had a great relationship with my parents, but I'm also fundamentally different than they are. I feel like no matter who I date they won't approve of that person, because I won't be attracted to someone who is christian conservative, and they won't be able to approve of somebody who isn't.

In all honesty, my boyfriend is about as close as they're going to get with me. He's a wonderful man. He takes care of himself, dresses well, is brilliantly smart, and he's funny. He isn't christian conservative, but he comes from a christian background, so we have a lot in common there.  He's always respectful of me, and I love him very much. I can't imagine not being with him, and one day would like to get married. Just not right now. 

Also, what in the world do my parents think I'll do on a road trip that I wouldn't do in my own apartment 2 hours away from them??! In all honesty, it would be harder for us to have sex while traveling.

Growing up my stepfather and I did not get along very well. And I was the subject of emotional abuse. I was often made an example of in front of his other kids. I've repressed a lot of the bad things that happened while growing up, but one thing that does come to mind was that my stepfather gave me a spanking for using the family computer when told not to (I was 14 at the time if I remember correctly).  I always felt as though I was being treated differently, but whenever I would bring it to his or my mother's attention it would either be dismissed or an argument would arise and my stepfather and I would not speak for months on end (while living under the same roof). Given that there wasn't much I could do in the situation (my father and I aren't the closest so moving in with him wasn't an option), I just kept my head in the books and studied so I could get into a good college. This vicious cycle continued for about **10 years**, until I went away to school.

I didn't realize the psychological toll that such a tumultuous upbringing would cause until my later adolescence. As a result, I currently suffer from low self-esteem (sort of), anxiety episodes, and mild depression to name a few things. And now that I'm moving back in I feel as though problems may being to resurface  because there's always been an unspoken double standard in my house between myself and my step-siblings (they definitely are treated better in my mind, but I'm aware that there is some sort of bias there). 

If there's anything that I've learned from the past 12 years, it has been that in the event that I meet someone who has kids from a prior relationship I treat the kid as if he/she were my own.

My coworker was very nice and didn't really give any creepy vibes off at first (he was friends with everyone, and genuinely seemed like a nice person) and we became friends somewhat (only talking at work). About a month after I started I realized he was doing extra stuff for me that he didn't do with other people, like always coming to my station to help me with my work, offering to buy me food, etc. I didn't think to much about it until one day when he offered to buy me food in front of a customer ( I declined ) and she straight up asked him if he liked me. He said he did, but we had to big of an age difference but if he we 20 years younger he would have asked me out.

So anyway I realized he liked me but nothing really changed until the last month or so. He's always been a touchy person (he hugs and high fives everyone) but recently he began adjusting my clothes ( like flipping my collar down when it was up and picking lose hair off my back) and always commenting about how great I am. When I'm closing my station at night I notice that he follows me around when he could be doing something else. I try to avoid being anywhere alone with him now.

In the last month, I was leaving work (everyone leaves together that closes at night ) and I was making a joke and he slid in a comment about how big my boobs are. He texted me later and apologized, but he did the same thing later on in the week. I also noticed that he stares at me. And last week, I made a comment to a different coworker about craving pizza. He told me about a place that was good and that would be open after work and I said okay I'll check it out and see how much it is. It was up the street so I drove directly there. GUESS WHO PULLS UP NEXT TO ME! So I went inside ( I should've just left ) and went to look at the pizza. He had already gone in ahead of me and he was looking at it too.

He turns and asks me if I wanted something and he would buy it and we could split it, but I declined and left. He followed CLOSELY behind and I cut off the conversation and got in my car and he got in his and left. I talked to a couple of people about it and some say he's just socially awkward and some say he's creepy and has problems. What should I do? I've dealt with creeps before but it was much more blatant?

He also recently made a comment about how pure and virginal I am.

My dad wanted to resolve something on my computer today that I had already fixed. I had brought the issue to my dad's attention 3 months ago, but for some reason, today he decided that he wanted to look at it. I told him that it was fixed, I didn't need his help anymore, end story. A half hour later or so, he asks again. At this point, I just tell him no. Another while later, he asks again, I say no, and he moves to take my laptop from where it was sitting next to me.

This is where things start to get messy. I grab my computer before him and put it on my lap. He tries to grab it away from me, and then I tell him that I really don't need his help anymore. At this point, he totally escalates the whole thing, yelling at me that since he bought my f*cking computer, he can look at it whenever he wants. 

My mom, who was sitting in the room, gets involved when she tells my dad to calm down, and asserts that both my dad and I are in the wrong. My dad takes this as a personal attack and launches into a huge rant, talking about how I am a minor in his household so he can look at my computer whenever, and that clearly since I didn't want him using my computer, I am holding lucrative secrets.

My mom jumps to my defense and starts yelling that of course I want some sort of simple privacy. My dad says that since I am a child and a minor in his household (I swear he said that like 50 times), I have no rights to any sort of privacy whatsoever and then he can go through my room, any of my things, or my computer, whenever the f*ck he wants, and that if my not wanting him to see my laptop doesn't put up red flags in my mom's mind, she's terribly mistaken.

My mom believes that I do not have any of these secrets that my dad talks about and I can personally say that I am not hiding anything. 

It is also worth noting that my dad is the most secretive person in the house. He has access to everyone's email accounts (including my mom's), can touch any of our electronics at any time (we had to demand that he ask before he do this), but throws a total fit if we touch his laptop, which is password protected (mine's not allowed to be) or his phone, which is also password protected (so is mine, but he knows it). He took away my phone, which worries me a bit (he's probably gonna dig through everything now) but I still have my laptop right now. He also thinks that me having 3 emails accounts (one for personal, one for school, one for an extra curricular that I'm in) is really suspicious.

I know that since I am living in my parent's house, I can't do whatever I want, but I feel like this is a little extreme. Is he being reasonable? What can I do?

**TL;DR** Dad is telling me that I have no right to even simple privacy in his household and is convinced that I keep secrets from them, has all of our passwords and can do whatever on our devices; mom doesn't think so at all, I don't think this is fair, what do I do/is he being a little crazy?

I chose to do so because my family isn't exactly rich. my parents saved up about $6000 from the time I was born for me to go to school, so I chose that path thinking more of them and their money problems than myself and my future. 

Fast forward to moving my boyfriend into his dorm: I realize everything I'm missing because I chose to think more of my parents, and decide that I want to go to a university.

background: My parents divorced when I was a baby. My mom went to three days of school to be a dental assistant and dropped out because she said it was too hard for her. My dad is a certified personnel expert and is almost as excited as I am about me going to college (he understands the loans and aid and everything money-wise more than mom because he has gone to college.) 

I told my parents and they told me to go for it, but the next day they talked and decided that I shouldn't start at a university until I finish my nail school. I explained to them that I graduate in December and Winter term at the university starts in January, so I will be done and if i want to get in, I need to apply now. 

They agreed to that, but my mother seems....resentful? of me because of all the fees that you have to pay that come along with applications and I had to pay to take the ACT and a late fee because I wanted to get into the soonest one so that the school would get my scores before term started. 

Every time I try to ask my mom for help, like for tax info for FAFSA or for info about her schooling or anything else related to my going to college, she freezes me out and will hang up on me or say she's too busy. The only real response I have gotten out of her was It's always money, money, money with you! how do you expect to pay for this school? I tried to explain to her that I would get student loans and that I will have some pretty substantial financial aid. She still froze me out. 

I need to know how to get her to loosen up and see that this is what's best for myself and my future, but I have no idea. Any help at all would be GREATLY appreciated.

13002,Non-Romantic,2osr0m,"My father Carl and I have not been close. Growing up he had no interest in me unless I brought something useful to the house. My mom was in charge of everything, so when I got scholarship money or won prizes for XYZ, she put it into an account in my grandpa's name so he couldn't touch it. 

I don't know why Carl and my mom stuck together for so long, but eventually I got sick of it and told my mom she could visit me, but I wanted nothing to do with Carl. 

Carl ended up getting shit from everyone about how he abandoned me and treated me like shit. My mom laid the guilt on thick and eventually he apologized, helped me out with some rent (I never asked, he offered), and started to be interested in my life. 

I thought I might have a better parent-adultchild relationship with Carl. I thought maybe he just wasn't a kid person. Which is fine, some people aren't meant to be parents. My mom was, and is, wonderful. She is so happy Carl and I are becoming close. 

I have been talking to him weekly for about two years now. It *was* nice that we could have some bonding. We usually watch the Walking Dead or some other show and then talk about it. He writes on my wall about how proud he is of me. I usually hide them so no one else sees, because I don't feel like I want people seeing Carl trying and then asking me about it. Most of my friends know how awkward it is with Carl. 

My friends have actually started labelling situations From Carl to [other awkward but lovable friend] how bad is the situation. We have a Carl scale, which might sound horrible, but it helps cope. I feel the situation is so weird it needs to have some sort of presence in my life that I can laugh about. 

Now, the issue is, while I didn't think it was a huge deal that Carl and I were talking again, I guess I really trusted he had changed. 

He came down to visit me (Mom and Carl live 45 minutes away) with some friends. They were passing through to go golf and hike at someone's house. They took me out to dinner. While we were there, one of the guys kept hitting on me. I think Dave is about 31. He is a bit younger but is the brother/cousin of one of the other guys, Steve. 

Carl told me that Dave would like to give me his number. I told him I wasn't interested. I'm 23, I don't need to date someone that much older. No shame in people who do that, but I like being around people my own age. I don't like older men. I rarely date 2+ years older. 

Well, when they passed back through again, Dave and Carl showed up at my apartment with alcohol. It made me really uncomfortable. I told them I didn't want to drink, I had work, and am dating someone. Getting drunk with my dad is not the idea of a cool Monday night. 

Dave and Carl insisted on staying. I texted some friends to come and help me get them out. They came, Dave was so drunk they called a cab. He ended up telling me I was really pretty and he wanted to take me out. I told him no.

A week or so later, my dad comes down alone. This time he has some paperwork. He tells me that he borrowed money because he was let go from his job and has been working for half the salary as before. He borrowed money from Dave in hopes he could pay it back when he got inheritance from my grandpa (who is healthy and well). It didn't happen. 

So now Dave has sad if I go out with him a few times he will forgive the interest on the debt and that will be it. My dad can pay at his leisure. I told him to leave. 

He didn't ask to borrow money from me. Not that I have any to really give. I am paying back my student loans. 

But God, I feel so fucking dirty over this. I know what Dave meant. He wants to sleep with me. Like I am some fucking prostitute. 

Carl keeps texting me about thinking about it. My mom doesn't know. I guess my dad told her Dave and I hit it off. She called and asked about it. I told her no, Dave hit on me, I wanted nothing to do with him. I am not sure what else to do. I mean, it's not illegal to be interested in your friend's daughter. But I feel so fucking used.

13012,Non-Romantic,2jg965,"tl;dr: This shit is a long read. I feel like I did a lot for my cousin,and she completely screwed me out of a lot of money and was a passive aggressive child who did next to nothing to help out around the house the entire time we lived together.


A while ago my cousin was in a bad spot living with her dad and stepmom. She couldn't really afford to move out because she had so many bills as well. I decided to let her come stay with me at my house,provided she only pay utilities and do dishes;so she was never on the lease. At some point I got a second job at the place she works at.

When she moved in,she brought a dog that was a rescue. I have two dogs myself,so I didn't mind. The thing is that this dog ended up being a nightmare. He would destroy the trash and chew up things. At one point,he broke the window in her room by knocking a fan into it. Apparently he started chewing on said window,so she took one of my dogs out of her crate and put him in. As a result of being out of her crate,my dog chewed a hole in my floor.

She got her dog his own crate,which he promptly began to destroy and freak out over. He destroyed it in around 3 days,along with shredding a third of my living room rug. Finally we decided to hire my friend chris to come watch him at 5 bucks an hour. It wasn't fair for him to be watching all of the dogs and only she had to pay,so I contributed to paying EVEN THOUGH my dogs didn't need to be watched.

My friend was unable to watch them anymore,and soon her dog began escaping the house through the STILL NOT FIXED window in her room. We blocked it well enough,then he started breaking out through a tiiiny space beside my a/c unit in the other window. Now it's not surprise he had so many issues. He was a rescue already,huskies need lots of daily exercise and stimulation and she wasn't giving him any of that. So she found him a home in the city 30 minutes away.She took in her friends dog after that,who was very well behaved.

She would do the dishes maybe once every three weeks to a month. I mean,they would pile up and sit there forever and it caused a serious roach problem. She took out the trash maybe twice the whole time she lived there. She never cleaned the bathroom,rarely dusted or swept. When asked about it she got extremely defensive and said she swept every day(uh,no. too much dog fur,every day,same spots). She once had a friend stay with us for a month or so because he was in a bad spot with an abusive relationship. I'm all for helping people so that's fine. But he never did anything to help out around the house or give us any money. Maybe he gave her money,but I never saw anything,and I'm the one paying rent.

The guy's crazy ex slashed my cousin's tire. My friend had begun staying with us as well,just to visit. He paid for a used tire to put on her car,we went and picked it up,and he put it on her car. The tire ended up blowing anyways,so she had her mom get her a new one. But still,the thought that counts. She barely thanked him for it.

We'll fast forward a little bit to the present. She is extremely passive aggressive and is constantly making snide remarks then going to her room and ignoring me. Last month,I had been stressed out about not making enough money. This month,I got better hours at my second job so I made more money. I bought her food 3 times in 2 weeks,and I got myself a new bed (it was a used futon,but I needed it because the dogs had pissed ON my old mattress so it was disgusting) and I got myself a few pairs of pants from goodwill that fit me because I've lost 30 pounds in the last 5 months,so none of mine fit anymore.

The moment I brought home those clothes,she made a remark about how I'm just ballin out lately and then walked away. The next day she came home and asked me if I had been smoking weed. I said no,she said well I can smell it all the way down the street. I gave her a funny look because it was weird that weed smell was floating around the neighborhood and said,nope,not meee in a funny accent and she whipped her head around and said,What is your problem,why do you have such an attitude?! and walked to her room. My friend and I just looked at each other confused because there was not a single hint of attitude in that at all. Why would I have even been mad?

So the next day,she texts me,and it goes like this: your dog has been digging in the trash ok thanks wtf ? you've been having an attitude or something the past few days like wtf. like last night and not even speaking today. She had come into work earlier as I was leaving and I didn't say anything to her because I was in a rush to get home,get changed,and go to my second job.

At this point,I was fed up. It doesn't sound all that bad in what I described,but seriously guys,she had been making these hostile remarks for weeks. I went off. I told her I thought that she was the one having an attitude. I told her that if she has any kind of problem that she needs to be a fucking adult and talk to me/ask me about it instead of making assumptions and being hostile towards me for no reason. She responded back saying that being in the house was bad for her health (i understand how anxiety can be,I have it too,but seriously she uses it as an excuse anytime something goes wrong and I don't even do anything to cause her anxiety. I come home,read,watch movies,and sleep. That's my life.) And said that she was moving in with her mom,my aunt. She said the utilities would be paid,and that she'd come get her furniture in a few days. Ok,whatever.

So yesterday was the day she came to get her furniture. I came home to find her room covered in dog fur from where she obviously hadn't swept because she never cleaned. Ok,that's cool I can just clean it. Whatever. Also found out that,she had told me her mom,my aunt,had fixed the window her dog broke. She fixed it alright;she screwed plexiglass onto the frame. My landlord will take that out of my deposit if that's not actually fixed by the time I move out,great. 

But it gets better. I opened the refrigerator and there's a note. Written on the power bill. It read I'm worse than karma,and I hear/see everything. Oh look,the power bill was due today. Too bad I'm too busy eating cupcakes to add to my cupcake top  

As an aside,the cupcake top thing is a reference to a snapchat I sent a mutual friend about a week before of her getting ready and I wrote cupcake top on it. I thought it was funny,it was in no way meant to be hurtful,but I do see how it could be and apparently it hurt her feelings. That was definitely my bad. But really the girl is super petite,way smaller than me,I wasn't intending it to be mean at all.

Anyways,she left me 80 dollars with the power bill. The bill was 156. When I texted her about it,she refused to pay me any more money and,long story short,told me to go fuck myself.

So,there you have it. If you've come this far in reading,great job!

Here is the situation. Two men in my friends group are in a fight. It has divided my friend group pretty much in half as people have chosen sides. One of the men (Todd) threw a brick through the other's (Alan's) window. Alan stole some property out of Todd's storage unit. Todd has been putting up ads saying Alan's business is now closed when it is still open. etc. etc. They are both playing dirty. 


What disturbs me now is that they are getting other people involved. Todd came across naked pictures of Alan's sister. Todd is now threatening to print the pictures and post them all over the front of Alan's shop for his whole family and all the customers to see. The thing is, Todd is keeping the pictures a secret to use as his secret weapon if Alan does anything else.


I am not involved in this fight. I have stayed out of it from the beginning. But I think it is crossing a line by getting other people involved in their pettiness. And ultimately I feel like Alan's sister's reputation will suffer more as a consequence for these guys' actions and that's not really fair. I am a friendly-acquaintance of Alan's sister and have her as a friend on Facebook. Should I alert Alan's sister and let her know about the pictures?

Alright, I know this would be really hard to believe, I went to the station this afternoon. There were a few people around, I went to make my report etc, I had to speak to one of the officers in charge, now I'm a tall guy, a bit beefy and when I informed him of what happened at my place of work. He literally burst out laughing, now bare in mind the officers here are pretty much a bunch of rednecks and called over a partner and told him about what happened. Something along the lines of this guy got touched up by his fag boss etc it took every ounce of willpower not to punch this guy in the face. The report was made though.




After this I took the advice of a couple of pms and got in touch with a lawyer, it was late, there was some trouble, but I got in touch with one through a friend I had to call really last minute, we went into my work HR around 5 this evening, work closes up around half 6, HR and administration specifically, everyone else heads home at 4.30/5ish. I filed a complaint with HR along with friends lawyer buddy there, HR basically took my complaint but let me plus lawyer know that unless there was concrete proof of harassment nothing would likely happen, the lady there was somewhat sympathetic or maybe she was just tired and wanted to go home, I'm not sure. Lawyer knows boss whatsapp'd me a few times, but I deleted him from my contacts as well as on whatsapp so those are most likely lost. However he has told me if anything comes up to call him as soon as possible and has let me know that without concrete proof it's possible that nothing will come out of this.


So there it is everyone. That was basically my evening, I went home after grabbing a pizza, I had dinner with my gf just now where I told her about the situation and she was pissed about it, I managed to get her not to call her uncle and bitch him out.

I have a friend who is pretty flaky and indecisive about weekends out. Normally I do not mind this because I don't have a set plan, but sometimes it's incredibly frustrating and I feel manipulated. 

This has happened twice now and I feel like I have a reason to be pissed. The only person who I've talked to about this says she just expects this from our friend, but I think we're too old for this behavior and it's very rude considering people may spend money and time getting to whatever we have planned and then things suddenly change. Anyway...

**Instance 1:** Two weeks ago I was hanging out with a few friends at a friend's apartment 4 blocks from a bar we were all supposed to meet at at 9:30pm. Around 9 I texted to ask when all of our other friends were leaving Flaky's apartment. Flaky said he wasn't sure yet, but that the band he wanted to see was playing at 10:30 so definitely before that. I said ok, then asked them to tell me when they were leaving. They were about 2-3 miles away whereas we could walk so I didn't want to go early. 

As well, we had originally planned to go to a different bar but Flaky wanted to see this band so this was essentially a change done at his request. So, it hits about 10pm and Flaky won't answer his phone. I call my other friend and she basically gives non-answers and says she doesn't want to push them to leave. Finally I call my fiancé who is there with his car since he promised to DD for the night. He can't get an answer out of them either. Meanwhile, the girl whose apartment we are at is getting tired and wants to go to bed so she has to kick us out.

At this point I'm annoyed because we have no answer, the band Flaky wants to see just finished playing, and I don't want to have 5 people pay for cover for this bar if he's going to change his mind last minute, especially since I need my fiancé to DD at the end of the night. 

Luckily fiancé calls me at 11:15 and says they're heading out. So this instance works out, but I still find it shitty that we ended up changing our plans for Flaky and he can't even bother to tell us when he's going to show up. Either way, I had a good time so I didn't say anything.

**Instance 2:** Last weekend we were hanging out at another friend's apartment with the plan to go to a bar for our mutual friend's (we'll call her Bday) birthday. We decide to go to the bar across the street from our friend's apartment because they're having a special dance party and we all like that bar. 

No one tells me Flaky is showing up with like 10 people. He shows up about a half hour before we were going to go to the bar and we end up staying at our friend's apartment until 11pm. This bar is ALWAYS crowded after 10, and everyone knows that. Bday and I finally force everyone outside and there's a line. So we all agree to go to another bar instead and plan to take cabs. 

Bday and I and 2 others run back to the apartment to grab our coats, as we get back (literally gone for 5 minutes), Flaky and the other half of the group are already in a cab and just about to leave before telling us they're going to a different bar much further away. Okay, fine. Bday is ok with it so that's all that matters. 

We get into a cab literally right after them. We get about halfway to the bar, a 30 dollar cab ride among 3 people, excluding Bday, (so not completely terrible) when Flaky texts and says there is a line outside the bar and they're at a different bar, which we are luckily close to. I 100% believe that he did not even get to the bar we were heading to. They left right before us and there's no alternate route to get to this bar that would be any faster, and fast enough to get to that other bar right after. 

Basically I think Flaky didn't want to go to the other bar and didn't want to give anyone a choice. He loves the bar we ended up at and it's 4 blocks from his apartment. When our friend tells us this Bday literally goes what the fuck because Flaky knows she doesn't like this bar (and I don't either, though that's not really significant). The bar is loud, overcrowded, overpriced, and always has a huge line.

So, we go. Spending another 5 bucks on the cab. And we get there and there's, of course, a huge line. So we end up waiting 20 minutes to get in and of course it's packed and loud. Bday and I stayed for about an hour and then left. 

I told Flaky the next day that I was kind of frustrated that we changed plans because it was Bday's birthday so we should have at least tried to accommodate her. He basically just made an excuse about how he figured it would be fine because of the line at the second bar we never got to.

I've already resolved that I'm probably not gonna hang out with Flaky for a while, at least not in situations where I'm depending on his direction or waiting for him. He is a mutual friend though and avoiding him is hard because he manages to get our friends over to his apartment almost every weekend. I know other people have been frustrated by him acting this way as well and haven't said anything.

Do I address this again or just let it go? I consider it relatively petty but also I'm tired of being in situations where I'm spending a ton of money and getting shafted, or where I end up somewhere I hate because everyone else is there.

13047,Non-Romantic,2u8oft,"I know it's a cliche - roommates fighting over doing the dirty dishes, but I have had plenty of messy roommates in the past and it's never been this bad or dirty. 5 of us moved in this August [22F, 23M, 22F, 22F], and I've had 0 problems with anyone but one roommate. She leaves her stuff everywhere, kitchen, living room, etc, and has to be told repeatedly to put it away (at least 5 times before she'll actually do it). This is also a big issue for me but I've tried to talk to her about it repeatedly and nothing gets through. 

The dishes are by far the worst part though, when we first moved in she would NEVER do them - and my other roommate [23 M] who's the nicest guy in the world, would just end up doing them when the sink got full, just because he's a good guy. Then, I had to talk to her and tell her that wasn't okay and she can't take advantage of our roommate, and that she needs to put on her big girl pants and clean and do them herself. She seemed to be leaving less dirty dishes in the sink (the rest of my roommates and I just wash them immediately after eating). Mysteriously, we've gone from ~30 dishes and ~30 pieces of silverware to barely any of either. 

Today, I had to go into her room to put back a card she lent me, and I found a box on the ground with a metric shit ton of dirty dishes in it. I am so furious, I don't want to ruin our friendship, and I don't want to be demeaning, but the closest thing I have to a game plan right now is when she gets home, walking beside her, making her pick up and put away every single thing she has, and making her wash the dishes in front of me until she is done. 

I refuse to baby her any longer, she is an absolute princess and has no idea how to an adult, but I also don't want to explode on her and get into a big fight or have her hate me, I JUST WANT HER TO FUCKING CLEAN UP AFTER HERSELF!! Is that too much to ask for?!

I'm not a passive person, I don't like to hold hate or resentment, but I'm at the point where just talking to her about it isn't working. I just need some advice

**tl;dr: My princess roommate refuses to act like an adult, leaves her shit everywhere, and lots of dirty dishes, until I talked with her. Thought the problem was solved, then found box of dirty dishes in her room. Now I don't know how to approach this and need advice.** 

edit: the other issue is that it's really hard to confront her about it because she'll just deny it/put the blame on others about the dishes. i.e. well the ones in the sink are maggie's, or i do all my dishes, which are just blatant lies. even if there's a dish with a meal she ate 3 hours ago, and we say, there are remnants of your food in here, she'll go, that's not mine. it's very hard to argue with someone like that

edit2: had some requests to post the box, here it is. it was a pretty deep box, around 2 feet, with a 6 cup stack right next to it and a baking sheet that also had dishes stacked on top of it next to it.

13057,Non-Romantic,2wm48t,"I just started a new part-time job and a coworker, we'll call her Sarah, has been friendly to me since orientation. She started at the same time as I did, for the same position. I started to feel comfortable around her when she talked to me a bit about her personal life and I thought she might end up being a friend. 

Sarah has been complaining a lot about not getting weekends off. She's been complaining a lot in general. She really doesn't want to be there but accepted the position out of desperation. Typically, people working in this position have to work one day during the weekend. Due to other circumstances, I'm only able to work two days. My manager has no issue with it and ended up permanently assigning me to two days during the week. So Sarah has to work one day each weekend (big fucking whoop) and I get weekends off. 

So as we were leaving work yesterday, Sarah was complaining again about working weekends and brought up my schedule. She jokingly acted jealous and I laughed about it too. I expressed that I was surprised but really happy about it. Then she said something like, Of course, we could always switch shifts once in a while. I stupidly said, Oh yeah, if anything ever comes up and she replied, I mean like I would do it just to have my freaking Saturday off. Because I can be such a clueless people-pleaser, I was all, Oh yeah, sure, it's still just one day. She assured me that it would only be sometimes. Whatever. 

I didn't realize until discussing this with my boyfriend that she didn't ask nicely. She didn't ask at all. She stated that she could switch days off with me, take MY days off, on occasion and I agreed. I know it doesn't matter that I agreed, I can still say no to her. And I will. I've already decided that I won't ever do it for her because of the way she tried to manipulate me. (I would also like to throw in here that she once said, in so many words, that I came off as someone who could be easily manipulated but she framed it like it was out of concern for me.)

I'm really upset with myself for letting someone treat me that way and not seeing any issue with it. It took my boyfriend pointing it out for me to realize that she wasn't treating me with respect.

13069,Non-Romantic,1vx3u6,"So. Where to start.

First of all, my mom has a history of problems with money. She also drinks quite a bit and has a tendency to repeat herself or forget conversations all together. Normally it's not a huge problem and I've talked to her about her drinking before, nothing has changed. She lost her parents at a young age and has been depressed a long time.

My fiancé and I are getting married this year. Her daughter getting married is a big deal. My parents have contributed a significant amount of the cost and his parents have contributed the same amount.

I also want to say that I am in no means ungrateful for the money they have spent, the wedding is going to be an awesome day and it's not exactly what we wanted, but I am my mom's only daughter and they are paying the majority of it.

My mom has been spending all along and has told us several times she would cover something only to come back and say oh will you pay for that? I haven't minded but tonight I just about lost my shit. 

I had budgeted 5000 dollars for the rest of the wedding, that included 2500 I thought I owed her, plus 2000 for deposits we have to make the day of and gifts for our parents and the wedding party, and the cake and 1000 for our honeymoon. So all in all a pretty tight budget. I would have been FINE if she had been straight up and told me we should pay for this or we can pay her back so we could have budgeted for it.

She had told me that she would pay for the limo that would cost 200 dollars. She told me she would cover the DJ and them came back and told us we owe 500 for that, fine. Whatever. She told me she would cover the flowers. Not anymore.

Tonight she informed me that we owe not 2000 but 2500 for the venue, 500 for the DJ, 400 for flowers, 500 for decorations, AND 1000 EFFING DOLLARS FOR A LIMO!

I honestly am baffled. I said 800 is ridiculous for a car, we're cancelling that. But no. She's paid a 300 dollar deposit on this limo that we'll have for less than an hour total time in the vehicle (spread out) and it's non-refundable. She not only didn't mention the deposit to me but She also didn't mention that the price had increased by 800 dollars AND we were paying for it! She also wants us to pay for the rehearsal dinner, which I wanted to do a BBQ for and she changed it to expensive Thai food and she said she would pay for it. She asked me if we were covering that today AND the cost of brunch on Sunday which I had told her up and down a thousand times that under no conditions were we paying for a brunch after the wedding for whoever and their second cousin wants to attend. Everyone can cover their own breakfast at the hotel and we won't even be there!

So I called my dad (they are together) and talked to him and explained the situation. He was under the impression that she was telling us we owed anything over the money they paid for the venue, when in reality she told us we owe nothing. Now with less than two months to go we need to come up with an extra 3000 dollars, which as a couple who is just starting out is ludicrous!

I don't know what to do. Anytime I express any anger or frustration my mom cries and gets upset. I feel bad, say sorry and fix things. I seriously can't fix this one!

The hardest part is this wasn't what my fiancé and I wanted for our wedding. We wanted a small wedding, under 5000 with just family and close friends. Nothing big. This wedding is going to cost us alone almost 8000 dollars and god knows what else she has spent plus the money they and my MIL has given us. God knows what else she has spent too! I am happy about this wedding, it'll be great, lots of people attending and it'll be awesome to remember instead of a backyard wedding with no traditional wedding stuff. I am so grateful for what they originally gave us and what my fiancés parents have given.

I'm sick of the surprises with her when she says she'll cover something and them comes back and tells us we owe her. She also seems to think that with a wedding of 120 people we'd walk away with 15,000 in gifts. I would be shocked if we got 5000. Half the guest list is from far away and will travel for the wedding, the other half I don't think is going to give upwards of 200 dollars per person for a gift! This has happened my whole life with my mom and I don't know how to put a stop to it. To me, when you say you'll cover something, you cover it, and there's no backsies on that.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to ruin my relationship with my mother and I don't want to damage my parents relationship. I honestly want to just give them the 5000 but that would literally put us in so much debt for this wedding when we already have a mortgage, a vehicle and a student loan to pay off. Right now we're sitting at almost double what we originally planned to spend and I feel disgusted that it's all on one day, there is also no way to cancel right now and not take a massive loss.

I have tried talking to her about not spending money without talking to me and she didn't listen, obviously, because she spent 800 dollars of our money without telling us. I have tried telling her no more planning. She didn't listen. I tried telling her no, she didn't listen.

I can't handle this. Does anyone have any advice? Help!

TL;DR my mom says my fiancé and I owe 2500 dollars above what we agreed upon she could spend for our wedding. She originally told us she would cover all of it and we didn't have to worry.",My mom spent 5000 dollars that we now owe her on our wedding and didn't tell us,0.0,False,109.0,73.0,1390453577.0,/r/relationships/comments/1vx3u6/my_mom_spent_5000_dollars_that_we_now_owe_her_on/,NonRomantic
13073,Non-Romantic,2c4l22,"As the title says I'm beginning to hold a lot of resentment towards my mum and our relationship appears to be getting progressively worse. It's pretty much just a load of small things that have been piling up and I feel more and more annoyed/angry at her everyday. I appreciate all she's done for me and for raising me and all that stuff but there's a lot I'm happy about.


Some examples:
She quit her job and took a long (2 month) overseas trip to Europe leaving my dad as the sole provider for the family and the one left to run our day to day lives. Since she's gotten back she's always complaining to me about how there's no money left and I'm just wasting money (I personally disagree with her statement that I waste money which makes this worse) and all that stuff when I can't help but sit here and think that she was the one who quit her job and spent thousands of dollars on an overseas trip which put us in this slightly worse off financial position.


Another thing that's been annoying is that recently I've had quite a serious knee injury which has disrupted my life significantly. She's been the one taking me to all of my appointments as my dad has been unable to but she always insists on coming into the room with whoever I'm seeing for some reason. She seems to take it upon herself to do all the talking for me and won't ever give me a chance to get a word in. Also after I got the initial news of how serious my knee injury was I was quite upset as it means that I won't be able to play rugby again until 2016 (this is a big deal to me because it's a massive part of my life) and I need to have surgery. The first thing she said to me was well you really have to study hard for school now and that just kind of made matters worse because all it done was stressed me out more.


Other than that stuff there's other things which really get on my nerve such as her refusing to knock upon entering my room (she says its her house so she shouldn't need to knock) and also if my door is closed when she comes in she will leave it open when she leaves even if I ask her to close it.


Anyway to avoid turning this into a huge rant I'll leave it there but I really want advice as to how I can feel all around better about my relationship with her as I really want to have a good relationship with her but all this pent up resentment isn't going to help with that at all.

Since getting her pregnant wasn't bad enough, she and her family strong-armed him into marrying her no less than 3 months later. Yes, I realize he is partly to blame for marrying her.

Strike freaking 3. (It's also been said that she's afraid her husband wants to have sexual relations with me, so that's a possible explanation for her behavior... but totally unjustified. I can't go by simply hearsay.)



I have no idea what to do. I've blocked her from everything I possibly can, and she's somehow getting information about me. I'm getting nervous that this isn't just a phase. I'm concerned that she's taking it too far, and that she'll do something stupid. I can understand looking up to someone, but in my entire life, I have never encountered someone like this. Even when we're in person, she'll just stare at me. She won't speak to me, she'll just stare and take pictures of me. What can I do to put this all behind me? A restraining order has been considered, but I'd like advice on this, please. I don't want to do that, because I'd like to have a relationship with my nephew, so I don't think that would work. If there's a nonlegal way to either fix this relationship, or at least figure how not to have a mess from telling her I just don't want to be friends with her, that would be great.

I have always extended a standing invite for anybody in this group to visit my family with me, but over the past few years the opportunity never really came up or people were broke or whatever. I had planned to go home for a visit when I was forced to take medical leave from my job and had recently found a great deal on plane fare and two of my friends had just been laid off from work and so I invited them to come with me since they weren't doing anything. They said yes. I posted about it on facebook and another person contacted me and said they wanted to go, and a few people expressed interest but the others didn't follow through. 3 people and I bought our tickets together and nobody else contacted me about it so I figured that was that. 

Hanging out with the greater group of friends, some of them who hadn't seen my post, my friend who this post is about (We'll call her Dana) said Oh, I would love to go, too bad I didn't see your post. She had deleted her facebook and I didn't think to text her about it because it was a general facebook invite; plus she's always broke, she had plans to visit her family in another state that month and has a hard time getting time off work. She mentioned all of this during that conversation. I took this as an overall rejection and we didn't talk about it after that at all. 

Then some other friends got free tickets from somebody's frequent flier miles and the group ended up with 4 more people who I originally did not plan on going with me. They bought their tickets without really telling me first or anything. It ended up fine, but I was very stressed trying to coordinate the plans with my friends and my family, and it was more than I planned for. Anyway, we get home and my friend Dana is acting sort of strange towards me, but I didn't think anything of it because she is sort of stand-offish and we're not all that close, we hang out but don't really talk on the phone or text or anything.

So  we are hanging out with a group that included a bunch of  people that went and we were talking about the trip, and she basically told me that she was mad at me because she wasn't invited and everyone else was. So I explained that I had not specifically invited anybody but the two people I knew for sure had nothing to do, and that everyone else kind of invited themselves after I had already made the plans  and got their tickets on their own without really consulting me about it. She was upset but we talked it out and she seemed ok with it in the end and said she wasn't mad. 

However, since then we have rarely talked, she's invited other people to things and not invited me when she usually would have, cancelled regular plans that we have together, and today she made a comment on one of the pictures from the trip which I  uploaded when we got back (2 months ago.) I commented haha wow late without thinking about the fact that it might be a sore subject (because I thought we were cool!) and she responded  Maybe I wouldve been on time IF I WAS INVITED and I don't even know how to respond. So clearly she's still mad. I don't know what else I can do, I know I hurt her feelings and I tried to apologize and invited her to go with me in the spring when I go visit again, but clearly that didn't make it okay. I just want to know if y'all think she's overreacting, my other friends say she's not mad but I can tell she is. I don't know if there's any way I can fix it or even if I should try.

13094,Non-Romantic,3eoo6k,"Bear with me reddit but I need to be very specific.

I am currently living with my parents [40s] and my sibling [14M]. 
When I was 18, I moved to the US on a student visa to get my degree in Business, but a situation arose that forced me to go back to living with my parents in South America. However, it's becoming harder for me to stand living at home.

Now, to give you some background my brother as the youngest has always had the most attention and benefits in some areas, which is fine because since I was five I understood that. I am my parents' academic pride and joy. He is less motivated in school and often cheats and has others do his work for him. He's incredibly rude and disrespects his friends and the family. He embarrasses his friends and makes sure to establish that everyone is inferior to him. 

My parents just can't bring themselves to tell him that he did something is wrong or that he's being bad, partly because he has a very aggressive behavior and he's very very emotional (think punching the walls when he's upset and kicking stuff and punching some more stuff). As a result my parents have avoided nagging him altogether because they fear his possible reaction. You can probably see where I'm going already.

I am a very laid back and non-hostile kind of person, I have never liked arguments or drama so I try to avoid both of them actively in my daily life. My brother gets worked up over nothing, and he is very insulting and offending (words like motherfucker, bitch, and piece of shit are part of his daily lingo). I don't feel I deserve any of this since I don't do that and I am very respectful and generally don't like to insult people. I believe you should treat people the way you like to be treated. 

However, sometimes I lose my cool and my immature self does the same things he does, and I go off on him and respond to his insults with my insults. When this happens, my parents scold me seriously and take his side and tell me to stop being so rude and offensive and that it's uncalled for, but they will NEVER tell him he's being wrong by doing it either. This situation has gotten progressively worse, to a point where he once got physical with me because I told him to ask me for permission if he was gonna use my clothes (he thought I called him a liar and he hit me basically, all while insulting me). When this happened, I told my mother what happened, and all she could say was Well, that's what you get for talking to him about it when he eats.

I do have options and no, my parents won't cut me off from college expenses if I go live with someone else because they know I'm probably gonna be their only child to get a degree and have a professional life (my brother wants to be a professional soccer player, but he's not that good and he does not seek to improve), but it gets more complicated because they also finance my trips abroad to go visit my long distance girlfriend. This is a big reason why I don't want to make any hasty decisions that may jeopardize my visits. 

But this situation just keeps getting worse and I feel myself resenting my entire family and constantly fantasizing of my future once I'm done with school. I grin when I think I won't have a reason to stay in contact with my family or even see them anymore. Just yesterday we had dinner, and as I sat across them I realized I didn't recognize who these people were. I look at my family and I only see strangers now, a bad memory of how we used to be. What can I do?

TL;DR I can't take my abusive, spoiled brat of a brother's behavior anymore or my parents' neglect. It's affecting me negatively and I can't escape because they finance a good portion of my life. I resent them profoundly.

5 years ago, my good friend Kristi was sexually assaulted by a mutual friend, Anton. Being best friends with Kristi at the time, I did my best to support her throughout the aftermath while still keeping my own life on track (mainly with school, which I tend to struggle with anyway)

At first, Kristi's reaction seemed as normal one might expect from an experience like this; her self-esteem issues were exacerbated, she developed trust issues, degrees of paranoia, anxiety and depression. The only part of the aftermath that I did not expect was her decision to not contact any authorities- she hasn't offered to explain to me why, and I'm generally hesitant to approach the subject.

Ever since she recovered to the point where she was able to function, Kristi has obsessed over Anton and making his life miserable. The first sign of this was about a year after the incident, when she sent a message to all of the members in a mutual FB group explaining (without detail) what Anton did to her, and stating that anyone who did not immediately cease contact with him would be cut completely out of her life. I know that in several instances, she made good on that threat.

Since then, she's gotten progressively worse. She follows his and his family's blogs, often checking them several time a day. She has barred herself from attending any social event that he *might* show up at, even though he lives several hundred miles away. She refuses to seek professional help, because she doesn't want to forgive Anton and feels that a therapist might make her do that.

In the meantime, her life is falling to shambles. She is afraid to let her boyfriend touch her, her friends have either left her or have been forced out of her life for either talking to Anton or questioning her methods of recovery. Her grades are low enough that she risks being dropped from her college.

I have tried on several separate occasions to point out what she is doing to herself, but generally have been forced onto the defensive (I can't believe you would say that! Do you *understand* what he did to me?) About a year ago, I was able to get to her admit that maybe checking his blog daily wasn't good for her mental state, but I haven't seen any sign of her letting up.

A few days ago, I was reading *Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption,* by Laura Hillenbrand (fantastic book, by the way) the other day, and came across this passage:

&gt;The paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain will come only when their tormentors suffer.

This highlights Kristi's problem better than I ever could. I think that she feels her ability to be happy is contingent on Anton's suffering, and Anton, to his credit, appears extremely resilient.

How can I, as her friend, help her realize that she can be happy again without making Anton miserable? Can I?

13100,Non-Romantic,310krq,"So lets start at the beginning. Close to a year ago, I joined a startup company with 15 employees, with my immediate team of two others (boss and coworker). I'm relunctant to give more info as everyone in the office glances at reddit. Anyways I love the people and environment here but my work (QA) is pretty routine but it pays the bills and then some. I feel loyal to this company and the its CEO as they were amazing when I took a month off after losing my dad. I very much want the company to succeed. At the same time, any action I take will rock the boat.

Anyways the company expanded a few months into my stay, doubling the engineering team size for quicker agile sprints to better meet customer needs. My boss attempted hiring more QA during this time but after a couple failed tries with new blood, gave up and eventually the funding was given to another department. I moved on and figured we'd try again later.

Now a thing I should mention is that my boss and coworker are the definiton of workaholics. These people will work 60+ hour weeks without a second thought and think it's not an issue. In fact a large majority of my company works over 50 hours and is proud of it.

Second series of events occurs when instead of a two week agile project, the company decides to do one major project with a three month turnaround. Qa gets three weeks to do their thing. We do. My hours shot up to 60 hours a week, with my coworkers doing full 80 hour weeks. I feel for sure that this means we should hire more QA resources and bring collective hours of our team down.

And now we get to my current dilemma. We expanded again. Sales is expanding due to some key deals made. Engineering is expanding to help with scaling up the operation for more users. And QA just refused a hire and gave the funding to engineering...

Now I've tried hinting that I'm not ok with this. Ever since the large project I've been vocal that we needed more QA as the workload is just getting more larger and complex as we add larger features. I've stuck my neck out and gotten resumes from acquaintances who come with great references from ex coworkers, and they're never brought in to interview. My boss stonewalled me for weeks on the status of hiring until this afternoon, when he informed me the job wasn't available anymore. I wasn't given a reason.

So I guess what I'm asking for is advice on how to converse with my boss on this. He and I don't talk much and he usually just gives me assignments and asks for progress every day. Meanwhile he has a great relationship with my co-worker who happens to sit next to him while I'm stuck fifteen feet away and only corresponding through our office IM. I guess I would just feel kind of awkward blurting out This seems stupid, why are we being stupid?

 So I guess I'm looking for ways to open a conversation on multiple fronts. Of how I'm having issues with the work hours. Why we're not expanding to better help the company?  Why are you not talking with me about these decisions like I don't exist?

TL;DR My boss and coworker are workaholics who won't hire more help and the work is beginning to spill over and affect my hours.

13110,Non-Romantic,32bydo,"Edit: Sorry title is a bit misworded. It is my mom getting married not me.

My mother and I have never been particularly close, I'm socially awkward [diagnosed, not sure if this impairs my judgement of situation] and haven't been close to any of my family really but we get along.

I'm unsure how to explain how I feel or how to word this but the short version is; my mother was a single parent all of my life. Now she is due to be married and I feel like I'm not part of her new life.I talk to my mother maybe once a week  but that isn't my issue. I could call more but I'm unsure what to say- again I'm just socially retarded I struggle with small talk.

I guess the things bothering me are that I see her and husband-to-be always talking about their great weekends, discussing the wedding, talking about hen/stag parties, photos of them and her fiance's family's kids on Facebook etc. I'm never part of any of this, never invited or included. I also never get to do anything alone with my mom anymore, we don't hang out -ever because she is too busy.

I don't know if I am just being ridiculous or if there is something I should do. I don't know what to say to her. Is he going to be my step-dad? Am I meant to ask about this? He never talks to me and if I reach out to my mother it's very short responses and often no response at all.

Other than my mother I am alone. Most of my family is passed away or not close to me. I feel like I am losing the only parent I have. I know, her getting married and having her own life is great but can't I be part of it? I'm never invited or included in anything they do anymore.

I miss my mom. I have never wished for my father to be around [he's an a-hole] but I wish he was here now just so I didn't feel so abandoned.

It sounds dumb and ridiculous for me at 22 to need this help but my main question I need advice with is how do I deal with this? How do I deal with the 'is he my step-dad now?' thing too? I'm just not used to all of this or having to talk about feelings and could use some guidance on how to do it.

13129,Non-Romantic,1v5wmk,"Ok so there is a lot more to this than just the title.  I will keep it as brief as I can but there is a lot of backstory to this and I am looking for advice on how to help him, walking away and turning my back is NOT an option so if that is your advice just move on tot he next link.  

I was, at a young age, addicted to coke, weed and an extreme alcoholic.  I was caught on Christmas Eve when my dad found a bag of coke in my car door. Shit hit the fan, my immediate family (parents and siblings) were told and I was forced to get some help.  My dad had my back and took me to meetings because he too had struggled with alcohol and that was how he had stopped. He took me to a meeting everyday for 30 days and I was able to quit cocaine, weed and drinking cold turkey. 

Now a bit about him.  He was a HEAVY alcoholic when I was younger.  SO bad that he had an aortic embolism and started drinking again shortly thereafter.  It was hard on my family, constant fighting and arguing for him to get better but it didn't sink in for quite sometime.  Finally he got the help that he needed and was clean for 15 years, or so we thought.

So fast forward a bit, I no longer do any drugs but still drank.  I now know that I have a problem that I ignored for a long time, I binge drink to the point of blacking out  but never admitted that it was a problem because I wasn't drinking everyday.  I have accepted that and have stopped drinking ANY alcohol since about October.  I just decided that it wasn't worth it, especially since I only drank that much 3-4 times a year. I was running from something and I needed to grow up and just face my demons head on.  

So while out running some errands today I received a text from my sister saying that she would like to talk.  I brushed it off and kept going about my day until her nagging wouldn't stop and I went over.  She told me that our dad has been drinking again and it has been going on for a long time and that he drank so much last night he was sick and missed work today. (SIDE NOTE: MY MOM IS OUT OF TOWN FOR HTE WEEK) No one knows why he decided to start again and that according to different sources this has been going on for quite some time (somewhere between 1-3 years).  My mom never said anything to anyone and his partner at work didn't either even though she had noticed that something was different.  

Now last week I was at my parents house for a visit and noticed that his breath smelled of liquor, not beer or alcohol in general but whiskey.  I brushed it off as a NO WAY! HE HASN'T HAD A DRINK IN 15 YEARS. and asked my husband when in the car if he noticed anything, he said no and that my dad doesn't drink so why would he stink.  I agreed with him and said You're right.  Then, I heard all of this today and all I could do was cry because I felt like I had let him down.  

So After talking with my sister I decided that I should go see him and find out what is going on and why.  He didn't have much to say and couldn't give me a reason as to why he started drinking again.  He was remorseful but clearly hungover.  I sat and cried and told him that I was there to help and he didn't let me do it on my own so I wouldn't have him do it on his own either.  I took him to an AA meeting tonight and we went together and got some numbers of people for him to call and took a step in the right direction.  

Here is my biggest concern; how do I know he is ready to stop for good again and not just in a bad place in this bender.  We have all been there too hungover and say I swear to God I will never drink again if I can just feel better.  How do I know he is ready to take this step and go through recovery again?  I cried after that meeting in front of a few people saying he was there for me when I hit rock bottom and it's only fair I am here for him.  The other issues are my sister that told me wants nothing to do with this (she is the oldest) has seen him go through it before and has washed her hands of this, she doesn't understand why my mom didn't just kick him out.  My mom doesn't think he needs therapy, she said this is just like weight loss (NOTHING LIKE IT) and that he will lose his job for getting help (AGAIN COMPLETELY WRONG).  What I am I to do? I feel so alone and I don't think I can battle his demons for him, even though I want to!

Sorry if this was all over the place, my head is all over the place and I just don't know what to do right now.

13130,Non-Romantic,2otr4q,"So my roommates and I have been friends close to 3 years and consider them both my best friends. We've been rooming together since July and it hasn't been the easiest thing to do.

Friday I came home to a cleaned kitchen. No surprise because my roommate (who'll be known as Golf) said he'd clean it because he was off Friday because he had to work the weekend. So I thought, cool.
 
I wake up Saturday morning and go into the kitchen and wonder where some of my dishes were. After a few seconds of looking I find that 4-5 dirty dishes(crock pot, brownie pan, mixing bowls) were put away in the cabinets as if they were clean. I chuckle a bit to myself, and check the time, 10:45. So Golf is at work.

I text him, Did you really put dirty dishes in the cabinets? Lol trying to keep it light because I'm not mad, just want to know why he did it.

He's confused, What?

I explain, My crock pot, that bowl of (other roommate, Echo) the waffle maker. Everything that was next to the sink before you cleaned the kitchen was dirty. That pan that was in the dishes stacked in the corner.

He replies with, Yeah my bad...kitchen looks nasty with all that shit everywhere
I thought the george foreman was clean cause you usually wash it that's why i didn't put it there.

I thought I was being reasonable by saying, Yeah I mean I agree that it looks nasty but you could have washed it lol (talking about the dirty dishes that were stacked up by the sink)

He says, Most of that belongs to you and Echo...literally everything I cleaned from the kitchen was either yours of Echo's. He's been known to never do dishes, not do anything Echo or I ask of him. 

I don't mean to sound like a jerk but I say, Don't even start that. If you're going to clean the entire kitchen that's fine. But don't put dirty dishes in the cabinets like they're clean. You could leave them there. Or wash them. We live in an apartment together. No the dorms. It's a group effort. This is one of the reasons I hate texting. That sounds like a super dick statement but it would have come out so differently if I had said it in person. 

He got heated and went on the offensive, I didn't know they were fucking dirty because I grabbed them and pt them up. Next time clean that shit yourself you ungrateful fuck I don't put up with being talked to like that. 

I got super pissed and just let him have it because it's the truth.
You really want to start this? I was just bringing up something in a nice way to not sound like a dick and you go on the offensive and hostile you stupid shit. what have you contributed to this apartment? Not a goddamn thing. Echo and i bought the furniture. The toaster. All the dishes. The vacuum. Most of the cleaning supplies. The first three months we lived here you did dishes maybe twice. Never loaded them in the dishwasher or paid attention to anything Echo and i asked of you. You ungrateful fuck' 

Now I appreciate you cleaning the kitchen, but the next time if there are dishes of mine you don't clean just let me know that you didn't clean them and I'll clean them.

He responds with more insults, not just to me either
 That's your problem you think you don't sound like a dick but you actually do and that's not the first time you've done it. It's not my fault you and Echo are lazy and want to leave all your shit everywhere. Don't worry about me using any of your things I'll have my own. and your couches don't even worry about that either. I'll be moving out next year because it's obvious that we don't see eye to eye.

I try to mend the situation,
It's through text message that words are misinterpreted, which is probably why you think I sound like a dick. you're pretty much just as lazy as us. I don't mind you using my stuff just as long as you contribute too. I know I'm a little messy in the common areas but all you have to do is say something to me like i feel i try to do to you.

Shortly followed by, are we gonna get past this? or are you gonna hold a grudge and not talk to me for two months.

About two years ago, I did something unknowingly and Golf ignored me except for at work, where he hardly talked to me, for about two months. I had no idea what happened and he doesn't even remember what I did; just that I said something to piss him off about his now ex-girlfriend.

He hadn't responded so I figured I should just apologize because I thought about it. This is stupid. This is a very idiotic reason to fight. It had been about 30 minutes since my last text.

So I say, Alright man listen. You're one of my best friends. Sorry for sounding like a dick. I'll try to work on it and not keep my stuff lying around the living room.

I let that text sit for 15-20 minutes before sending it. I make sure it sounds right and it's good to go. I send it.

No response. Figured as much would happen. Maybe he just needed to cool off over night.



Monday afternoon I get Golf poked you on Facebook notification. I think, Oh cool. So I go to my pokes. The poke isn't there. I hit back and see it was indeed his name that poked me. So I go to his profile. Error loading profile. I got on my PC to look at his profile and I can't view it. He's blocked me. He poked me, and blocked me so I knew he blocked me.

I text him at 4:30PM 
Can we please talk when you get home?
I was tired of not talking and this stupid FB bullcrap and wanted to try face-to-face communication.

Nothing. Saw him walk in the door, walk by my room and go into his. Just like Saturday night. He comes home from work and I greet him, Hey man. Walks right by me.


So tonight I come home from my girlfriend's and I notice Golf has bought his own George Foreman grill, set of silverware, and drinking glasses. I'm fed up.

I go and knock on his door. No response.
Golf No response.
Are we really not going to talk? No response.
We're seriously not going to be friends over something so dumb? No response.

So I'm here. This guy is my best friend and this is a foolish reason to not be friends. I'm thinking he'll get over it with time, but he's also stubborn and proud enough not to. I'm just a little upset because I've apologized sincerely and made multiple attempts to talk.

Does anyone have any suggestions?

13133,Non-Romantic,1uzvfe,"SO, long story short my girlfriend has a child, age 2, from a past ex. The ex rarely visit her daughter, but majority of the time he is there to sort of flirt a bit with my girlfriend, he does not know she is seeing someone, mainly afraid he will do something crazy.

 So, pretty much my girlfriend is a little into debt with her college, she never finished it because she got pregnant. It really is not that much, but it will grow. Her ex is pretty much an ass. She stole her and her daughter's birth certificate and stolen my girlfriend's ID card. He also, used her SSN, we are trying to get social securities to change it, but they said they need concrete physical evidence. 

This is how it goes. My girlfriend currently lives with her parents. She does ALL the chores, cooking, cleaning, washing, etc and has to take care of her daughter. Everyone else pretty much works. There is one person who doesn't, but that isn't important right now. My girlfriend really does need a job. NOW a concern of mine is that I am afraid her pay check is going to all go straight to a baby sitter. The girl that doesn't work wants to be paid to watch her daughter and SHE lives in the same house. Personally, she is the type to want to get paid for doing nothing type of person. Don't get me wrong she is a sweet person, and trust worthy. Just wants to get paid for not doing much.

I am unsure what to do to help her out. She has tried making accessories here and there and does sell them, but it is not enough to really support her and her daughter as well as other expenses that will arise for her. There entire family is living paycheck-to-paycheck, my girlfriend also needs to use her WIC check to help feed the entire family as well, but most goes towards her daughter. 

Now me, I live 50 mins away. I help her out as much as possible. I pay a lot of attention to her daughter and she even loves the heck out of me, more than her biological father. She is always happy to see me and I am always happy to see them. I pay for everything we do and help her with some of the bills. I am a student, so I don't really mind for now. I got a part time job, which is simple and I get money for it. So, I help her out. The majority of the money is leftover money I have gotten from the government for school. I cannot keep doing this forever or else I will get into debt myself.

 I am unsure how to help her. She has no transportation herself, but I am sure she can ride the bus or walk, it is just if she does get a job I don't know who can watch the daughter. We were hoping when she does go to school, put her into some after school programs so her mother could work more and not pay anyone to watch her since most after school programs are free, but she is only 2. She won't be in school for a while. Being a college student myself, I am helping her daughter with the learning development her age demands and she is a bright little girl too. Talks, sings well and identifies a lot of objects for only being 2 and a half. 

Just, my girlfriend does need a job and quick. It really sucks her family makes her do all the chores, but she said she feels she doesn't contribute enough so she is willing to do them. At this pace she can't really get far with her life. She will be stuck there and I want to help her flourish into a better life. Any suggestions people. Many thanks.

My relationship with my mum is super close, I would say she is my best friend. The relationship with my dad is a little bit more complicated but thats not my issue at this moment. My issue is that my parents don't seem to take me seriously. 

For example: I tend to do Uniwork until 1,2am at night and then sleep until 8 or 9. When my dad calls me at that time to ask if I just woke up he will be like : Aaaw poor you have to get up so early in a sarcastic way. On the weekend he will usually wake me at 7:30 saying I should get up because its pretty late already. 

Another thing is that I like to take care of myself, meaning I like to have my nails done (my natural ones are horrible and break very easily). Ive had fake nails for 4 years now but here at home, there are no nail salons (small town). So now after 2 months they're almost grown out and it hurts because they start falling off/ripping off so Ive been complaining about wanting to get my nails done somewhere. My mom would comment: I wish I had your problems you poor girl. I told her that I don't appreciate the sarcasm and that I just simply like to keep up my appearance.  She doesn't understand why such comments make me upset. 

Another thing is that I run the household at the time of being at home because my parents don't have time/or nerve to do it. I don't mind, Im happy to help where I can as long as Im staying here. But as soon as I will forget to do something like for instance hovering, my mum or dad will say:  Is it really asked for too much to hoover?. Or You should help your mother more doing the garden (I do everything here, cook, wash, clean, tidy, walk the dog sooo..)

Another thing would be that both of them don't quite understand that I miss my independence which I had for so many years. They will still want to do family stuff A LOT and im cool with most of it. We have dinner together every night, and evenings are spent together in the living room unless I have other plans. Im fine with that. But they often want to do cinema nights, going to the beach all together and those kinds of things and if I politely refuse, my dad will get angry and disappointed. Im 23 years old turning 24 this year! I feel like a loser to be honest. I know this all will change in a few months when my dissertation is handed in and I will start looking for jobs or hopefully have found one by that time but still, I want to make things better at home for the time being without wanting to snap at tiny things.

**tl;dr**How can I tell them that I need more space without hurting their feelings? And how can I get over feeling like a joke to them? Or am I overreacting?

13141,Non-Romantic,1p4m64,"I live in a house of four other guys. I'm the only female, and am dating one of the guys in the household [20M]. This is long-term, and has been taking place for seven months prior to us moving in together. All of the guys are/were friends with me, albeit some more than others, and all of them are friends with my SO. 


I have problems with only one of my roommates, albeit two of them are dicks and like to use my pans to marinate dead squirrels in. I'm going to outline the problems I can without making this a wall o' text.


R is a heavy conservative, right-wing country-esque kind of guy. People jokingly (he hates it) call him a redneck. He has a hard time getting a job, and doesn't have money right now. He's heavily Christian, and has witnessed to people before. He's notably hot-headed, and I've seen him be indifferent to how people think of him (more power to him not to care). 


Now, me. I don't really debate politics, and I have a tendency to be louder when I'm debating with someone over other things. I do not realize it, and when people shh me, I notice my volume level and fix it. Most everyone who has been with me for awhile knows I just cannot gauge my volume level. I have a deep aversion to Christianity not because of the religion itself, but because of personal experiences that are abusive concerning it. So, I like to explore different Earth religions. I mostly just love reading about different mythologies. I do things like tarot, astrology, and such for fun. I have a very, very good cap on my anger and usually end up meditating to dissipate it, but if someone continues to build on it, I eventually have a tipping point.


The first occasion we had a problem, we were at a mutual friend's house. Everyone was stressed, including him over problems that I only heard afterward, and I was with my SO. One of the guys there who is newer to the friend group called my SO autistic while we were arguing about furries. (They were talking about sexual aspects, and I was trying to argue from the Redwall loving side.) I know my SO really dislikes that, and said that not to use that word, use something else. I know neither of us likes it. It was not in an angry manner, but I suddenly hear R, who I hadn't heard before, yell 'A woman can't tell a man what to say in his own fucking house.' 


Apparently, the entire time we were having this debate, he also thought I was talking over him. I didn't mean to, but I was in the kitchen cooking tacos for everyone while he was sitting, divided by a wall and a TV. At this point, I got really uncomfortable and slightly upset, so I left so the guys could enjoy the movie they were watching after I finished the tacos.


I went to a friend's, and went drinking. There was no more said on the subject from my part, but apparently my SO sent an angry text message to R. I had no idea this was going on, and was already several drinks in while at my friend's house. I already told her I was staying there tonight and hanging out with her. R texts me and states that I don't know how to handle my emotions and that I need to learn to control myself better or I won't survive in the real world or at my job.

My SO and R were really best friends their first semester, but I heard things broke apart when R started spending all of his time with his new girlfriend. So, I was drunk and upset, and basically tried to fix the situation. I told him not to be upset at my SO, and I told my SO I didn't want to get in between him and his friends, because that shouldn't happen. In my drunken state, trying to fix things, I broke up with my SO, and went to bed. Another one of R's text messages said that, if she didn't learn to let other people express an opinion, I'm going to slit her goddamn throat.


This almost culminated in me moving out, but things supposedly got fixed and went on. I do most of the cleaning in our kitchen, and when I cook, I always make sure to offer some to R and whoever else may be around because I know times are hard and I don't want them to be hungry.


Well, we come to last night. I have a terrible fear of fire, because my house burned down senior year and I had to basically take care of it and also pull things out of the ashes in the aftermath. It's a pretty emotionally scarring experience to lose everything you own. Two of my roommates, J and L, set up a fog machine that set off the smoke alarm. It terrified me, and I posted on facebook that I may be a killjoy, but no, I don't fucking find it funny when my roommates scare the shit out of me with smoke. I didn't say anything to them, and I was just upset and put it on FB then went to bed. Apparently a horrible idea in hindsight.


As a note, I made sure J and L knew I wasn't upset at them. In fact, in hindsight, it was HILARIOUS because my SO was the one who walked out. L posted something along the lines of 'chill out, toots'. My mother responded, explaining about the fire and such. J was already aware of this, and apologized to me the next morning.


Now, enter R. Who, first of all, isn't even at the house or in the same state, and has no idea what happened. He said, in context, One person can't expect a hole house of people to stop what they are doing, fun or other wise, for an evint they don't know about or understand. Its part of growing as a person. 


I got upset. My response was, in length, Okay, you know what, I didn't say SHIT last night. And fuck you, Rick. At least I defended you when those strangers made fun of your spelling. FUCK YOU. And Leif, no, I don't expect you to know about that, but John did. My feelings were hurt, sure, and it was more than terrifying for the smoke alarm to go off, but I don't expect anyone to understand. What I'm upset about is that the moment I get the LEAST UPSET about ANYTHING everyone tells me to lighten the fuck up. It's NO PROBLEM when everyone else is mad at me for something else. Fuck you guys. I'll just keep my mouth shut, like I have been doing. But don't you dare, dare even allude to the fact that I tried to stop you, because I didn't. I went to bed. I will not lighten up, because I didn't even say shit all.


I don't cuss at other people or get angry like this. In fact, most of the time, I handle my anger issues really well because I'm afraid of being like my mother. So the next message just killed me.  People tell u to lighten up cause you get supper pissed right off the bat, there is no anoid stage. Ur ok one second then pissed and storming off into another room and yelling. 


Note that this is taking place on my FB wall, not in a message or a text. He didn't even grace me with that. I don't actually ever yell. (I even stopped and asked the other guys who lived with me to make sure I don't, because I would be worried if I did.)

Yeah.. i got that from the description above.. i know how a smoke machine works so its not hard to figger out.. i've delt with panick atacks all my life so goodby to that part of ur argewment. If ur mad u need to say so and not go to face book or tell others insted of the people involved. Yeah I'm going to say ur wrong here cause I'm sick of watching u insult (SO) all the time then while ur walking threw the kitchen u both insult l and (his girlfriend's) ability to cut hair.. you've been makeing my home a hostle environment. There is a reason (she) and i nvr stay there any more.

I don't insult my SO. In fact, I love him to pieces. I'm upset, I'm questioning myself and how I handle things. I thought that I was joking, and no one will outright say if I'm being a bitch about it, but I don't see why he got involved when he wasn't even here.

13164,Non-Romantic,2xbsyy,"21/F college girl living off-campus, at home with my family.

Quick background: I was born &amp; raised overseas and moved here when I was 9. I quickly picked up English but was living in an abusive home til my mom divorced my dad when I was 13 and we moved out. I gained more freedom and tried to participate in more school activities and make friends, but always found it hard. Up until I was 13, I wasn't allowed to interact with boys and was scared to death because of my dad's threats. I also was rarely allowed to have friends over. My dad was also racist and my best friend was half-black so she could never come over...

Anyway when we moved out I thought things would get better, but I never really made any friends. I'm still relatively close to my best friend but she was really the only one I had throughout high school and during my first year of college. She moved to a different city so I never get to see her anymore. During my first year of university, I attended the orientation week events which are meant to bring people together, but all the people I met were a) also living off-campus and b) part of the faculty I got accepted to, but I switched faculties in 2nd year. For the first 2 years, I spent a lot of time with those friends I met in 1st year. We had our own little group and it was fun! 

Eventually, especially in 3rd year, we just stopped hanging out as much... Now, I haven't seen any of them since October. And when we do see each other, it's really awkward. I feel out of place, because each one of them has made OTHER friends throughout the years except for me and we never had much in common to begin with.

This year has been especially hard for me. I am 100% alone on campus. I run into people I know from class or work or that I briefly met sometime in my 4 years here, but that's about it. It's the most frustrating thing because I have become extremely self-conscious about my lack of friends and social life and very paranoid. I feel like people look at me as the weird girl with no friends or something. I know it sounds dumb, but it's truly how I feel walking around campus every day.

I know I'm not the only one, but it sure feels like it. And I have joined at least 3+ clubs every year and made sure to attend the events when I could, but even that was fruitless. I would go to the events, talk to some people, and then never see them again because they'd either never show up or the club would only hold like 2 events per year. 

I also started volunteering at the school radio station and met some people there. I really thought I would make friends there, but that has actually been my most disheartening experience. I absolutely LOVE working there because of my love of all things music and radio, but the people I'm with don't make me feel very comfortable. I've actually hung out with a few of them on many occasions, but each time it was either awkward or forced. Over the holidays, it was the most comfortable I felt but then I realized that the people I was becoming friends didn't want to be friends... Two of the guys there flirted with me every time we saw each other, knowing I am in a committed relationship.

It's just really depressing. There are so many events in my city and at school that I want to go to, but I have no one to go with. Not even my boyfriend, who lives an hour away, can really go to those things with me because I can only see him on the weekends and he doesn't feel comfortable going to those radio events with me knowing what I've told him about those two guys (who are always there!) 

Oh, and another thing is that it's almost like my loneliness has become a running joke between everyone. They always invite me to concerts and events and when I show up alone, it's really awkward. People have come to expect me to show up alone, but when I try to 'join in' it doesn't work... Those guys just hang out amongst themselves, trying to pick up chicks so it feels like the only way I could ever hang out with them is if I'm hooking up with one of them.

When I take a step back and think about my college experience, I realize that I have met no one I can call a true friend. The people who have approached me or wanted to hang out with me all ended up being guys interested in something more. I did meet a girl in 2nd year in class and we clicked so much, but then she moved away... I feel like now that I am 21, it's just hopeless and only downhill from here...

13167,Non-Romantic,3fme9d,"Let's start with some backstory. Also, this shouldn't be necessary to say, but names are changed and business is kept relatively vague. I think some of our customers are redditors and I genuinely don't need this to be brought up against me among everything else.

Sam - my fiance - has had this job for three years this August. He helped me get this job about a year and a half ago when I was at a really low point: unemployed and simply couldn't find work no matter how hard I tried. Giovanni - the owner of the business - was very kind and seemed like a genuinely fine person, though I always felt like I was walking on eggshells around him even from the start. Despite this, I was grateful for a job.

Giovanni runs this business with his right hand man, Fernando. Fernando is a very aggressive man and - when I point out that he speaks to us way too negatively/shouts at us - he says that is just the way he is. Giovanni generally relies more on passive-aggressive tactics - muttering under his breath about you while standing near you/walking past you... that sort of thing. Frequently, they will both (either together or of their own volition) rip you a new asshole right in front of customers.

They definitely didn't show this side until about 3 - 5 months into the job and Fernando even *told* me (!!!) that I had a 3 month grace period before he would start getting mean and that I needed to learn everything in the store to avoid that.. What does that even mean?

Now, I come from an abusive childhood. I know what it is like to be verbally and psychologically abused. It isn't fun and I am actually pretty vocal when I'm being treated poorly because I refuse to be in the victim position again. I'm pretty sure we've crossed abusive territory here with the stuff I'm about to describe, but I'm being told I'm absolutely nuts and I need to toughen up.

Here are a few things that happen:

* Fernando makes sexual comments towards me constantly. Even in the presence of Sam. Sexual jokes, telling me how nice I look, how he likes when I bend over, oh, bend backwards like that again, baby, *always* calling me pet names. I constantly tell him to stop. I once shouted at him not to touch me when he touched my thigh while I was eating lunch. Needless to say, at least he doesn't touch me...

* Giovanni will tell us to come into work very last minute. Just this morning, he texted **me** at 8am that **Sam** is working today. Work starts at 9am. I had asked him *last night* at 4pm whether we were working or not. He had so much time to tell us and he refuses to create a schedule. If he does make a schedule, he never sticks to it. This happens at least 3 times a week. Giovanni told me Saturday night at 11pm that I worked Sunday morning, for another recent example.

* Giovanni's father comes in and will also flirt with me relentlessly. I despise this old man. I generally am very good with children and the elderly, but this old man disrespects my boundaries and gets angry with me when I ignore him or tell him I don't want to speak with him. He also gropes me and I tense up whenever he walks by me, which is always way, *way* too close.

* Giovanni's sister's boyfriend (!?) also does the above to me.

* Giovanni got upset with me about a two-star Yelp review he got two months ago regarding a customer's first time in the store. She had said that the owner was rude by trying to shoo the her away and that the nice young lady helping her out pointed that out as well and she would not be returning to our store. *My boss* got upset with *me* for *someone else* pointing out that *he* was being rude to a customer.. I remember the scenario very clearly (which I can describe if it is really important, I guess), but he keeps telling me I'm wrong and that I should have let him help that customer.

* Giovanni and Fernando constantly push the short givings of other employees on to me. One particular example: Giovanni told me somebody else was cleaning my station that day, which include electric burners and soup warmer machine things (??). The person didn't shut either one of those off. I was blamed for that and the fact that they didn't do a very good job cleaning it. I don't see how this was fair.

* Giovanni put up a calendar at my request so we can record when we need days off. I put a doctor's appointment **a month in advance** on the calendar, tell Giovanni about it, and consider it done. The day approaches and I'm being literally ganged up on by Giovanni and Fernando telling me that I never told them and that I took somebody else's day off and how I am stupid and lazy.

* Oh, did I mention that they *constantly* tell Sam and I that we are stupid, lazy kids that never listen or like to be told what to do? We rarely ask for days off. We work 45+ (up to 60. Yes. **60**) hours a week. No benefits. Lifting 50+ lbs. every day. On our feet for at least 9.5 hours a day. No lunch breaks. And we don't complain. We simply ask that they speak to us like humans.

* God forbid if one of them comes into work hungover. Expect work to be hell for you because anything that happens to them, they push on you. You are their emotional punching bag for the day or even week.

* Any hours over 40 hours is under the table. This pisses me off. I don't know why, but it does. I would prefer that it is on my check and I would prefer to have my taxes taken out. I know it sounds crazy, but I would prefer it that way. I don't like that he pays us in cash for anything over 40 hours, but that is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things.

This is just a fraction of everything that they've done. Now that I've written it out, I'm not sure if this is even a problem or not... It sure seems like it.

And Sam and I are definitely *NOT* perfect angels, but we always come to work on time and we usually leave work a little later than closing because we always make sure everything is on the up and up before we leave. We genuinely care about this store and maintaining it, but I feel that neither Giovanni nor Fernando recognize this despite the fact that I have actually spoken to them about their actions (which they deny or fluff up) multiple times. 

Sam is much too timid and doesn't like to cause a scene, but I absolutely cannot stand to be mistreated, so I make sure to voice my opinion and tell them when they are being unfair. I always do this by asking to speak with them privately. If I ever call them out in defense of myself/of Sam in front of customers, they tell me that I am out of line... But I don't understand why they can't voice their issues with us privately? It is embarrassing when customers come up to you when the bosses are out of earshot and tell you Wow, you didn't deserve that or I am so sorry or Man, that was awkward or They must be in a bad mood today, don't take it personally. But it is almost every day. It is getting so hard not to take it personally.

Ugh. What do I do? I'm already looking for other jobs, but... I don't know who is going to pay us well enough/give us enough hours to afford our bills.

This isn't an update to my ongoing saga of telling a domestic abuse victim that I don't want to hear it anymore, but you can read those [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32n0gk/me_27f_with_my_brothers_40m_fiancee_44f_of_one/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/339nse/me_27f_with_my_brothers_40m_fiancee_44f_of_one/).

The people in this:

My brother, John [40 M]
His fiancee, Amanda [44 M]
His ex-wife, Marie [35 F]
My nephew, Gage [16 M]
My niece, Lisa [14 F]
My nephew, Damien [12 M]

So, Amanda, my brother's fiancee calls me and tells me that my brother John did something terrible. Now, as I posted about before, I told her I didn't want to hear it, but she insisted I wanted to hear this because it affects other things. And oh boy, does it ever!

So, one weekend, they decide to do Molly. Whatever, they can do what they please. They are adults. I don't care. Amanda tells me they decide to do it again next weekend, and he somehow slipped her cocaine instead of Molly. She knows nothing about drugs, and I honestly know even less so I have no idea how that could happen.

John used to be a giant coke fiend. I mean hardcore addict, also got into crack cocaine for awhile. It was a mess. Huge mess. She thinks he's been doing it for awhile.

Amanda also is proven to be a liar and somehow seems to thrive on my brother's abuse. I have no idea what to do, because she's already told me things that aren't true so I don't know if I can believe her.

So, Marie wants to send Gage to live with my brother on a long term basis since he is flunking out of school. She wants to send Damien for the summer, and Lisa when Lisa wants to come.

The kids already have mountains of issues already. Gage is failing out. Damien was expelled at 10 for sexually assaulting a classmate. Lisa is expected to help care for her younger half-siblings will maintaining a normal life.

Marie already knows my brother is abusive: she lived through it. 
My brother has never been abusive towards his children, so she is not worried about it, despite the history of abuse. She would mind the drugs, however.

I want to tell her about the drugs, but I've broken down all of my options and I feel screwed:

1. Do nothing, hoping for the best; nothing bad happens.
2. Do nothing, hoping for the best; John's on drugs and goes on one of his rages.
3. I tell Marie: She confronts my brother with the information (she wouldn't not say anything.) John attacks Amanda, and then probably me.
4. I tell John what Amanda said: John attacks Amanda

I have spent my entire life trying to protect these children as best as I can. I helped raise them, I've stepped into a maternal role when my brother was absent for most of their lives.

To make matters worse, I will not be home to run interference if shit hits the fan like I normally am. I have a lot of out of state trips planned.

13181,Non-Romantic,2y3ism,"Me and Jane have been friends since fifth grade. We were super close until high school and then we went our separate ways, she went on to college and I went on to do absolutely nothing.   
I dealt with depression, anxiety and all the crappy bullshit that comes with it (something I didn't had to deal with in high school, I was chatty, had a large group of friends, so in retrospective I think that when she probably talked to me, she felt like she was talking to an annoyingly draining person)    
I then moved to another state and we started talking less and less until we went almost six months without messaging or even texting one another. All of that changed within the last couple of years. I started getting better, moving on with my life and feeling good enough to actually talk about better things than Oh, woe is me.
We resumed our friendship as if nothing had ever happened and started planning ways to see one another. That opportunity arose earlier this year when she was given an internship in a city close to my town. I offered to pick her up at the airport (which is really, really far) and I was super excited to finally spend sometime with her.
I guess I should've mentioned this earlier in the post, but due to the issues I dealt with within the last years, even though I feel much better, I still struggle with making friends and meeting new people my age, so I basically only speak with friends I already know from years ago that don't live anywhere near me--I guess this is worth noting.     
Jane mentioned how amazing it would be for us to be so close to each other and to be able to hang out and do the things we used to do in high school.  
That week she spent at my house was just like I had envisioned. We joked, we went out everyday and I had fun for the first time in a long time with someone that's not part of my family. It was great.  
When it was time for her to leave, we spoke on the road about the next time we would see each other and how she couldn't wait to spend more time with me.  
Well, that's not how things have played out. 
We've barely talked ever since and yesterday, she did something that really hurt my feelings. She texted asking me to call her so I did.  
When she answered she said something along the lines of Thank you for calling me. I needed an excuse to leave the living room so I asked you to call me. Like, is not like she wanted to talk to me, is just that she needed me to get out of a situation and I was the only one that would call her so late.  
The few times we've talked since she came to live here have been because she needs something, or she needs to complain about her bosses and I let her because I feel guilty for all the times I've bullshited her with my own crap. I cut the conversation short by telling her I was going to bed and she apparently sensed I was upset and said she was sorry for not calling me that often or making any plans to see each other, that she was really busy but the truth is, I have her on Facebook and apparently she has made some new friends and am no longer needed, because all of these weekends she's hanging out somewhere new with them. I'm not saying I begrudge the fact that she made new friends, good for her, but I can't help feeling hurt and a little used when all she talked about before coming here was hanging out together. 
I haven't mentioned this to anyone else because it even sounds pathetic in my head.   
Should I cut the friendship or tell her how I feel? Or should I just accept this is the way things are and move on?

13196,Non-Romantic,2rrjdp,"My (26yo this month) brother has aspergers. He hates my partner. When he first met him he was ok, but over time he started to hate him because I guess I was changing since being with him. First he started just acting angry, then he started making up lies to justify his anger. The first lie he made up was that my partner bullied him in school - they went to different schools and my partner did not know him during school. Then he said my partner ran a hate club against him. He's said my partner will kill him, is a thief, and worse. He is a bad liar so none of the lies come off as convincing to anyone but it is deeply hurtful to my partner that he persists with these lies. My dad thinks he has convinced himself and genuinely believes them. Sometimes I catch him trying to find an out for his lies without admitting he lied (saying he saw a hypnotist and had memory regression and then as if to prompt you saying but I know you'll just say that they implanted a false memory) but no-one but me seems to pick up on it - and there's been too much anger between me and him to pursue those outs and get him to at least stop continuing with the lies even if he won't admit he lied.

This is a major source of tension and open hostility whenever I visit my family. I love my family, I even love my brother although it's years since I liked him and his behaviour. On top of this my fiance and my family have very different concepts of socially normative behaviour. My parents are more or less children of the 60s, they threw off all the rules because they thought they didn't need them and being shy and socially awkward the both of them they ended up with a weird and idiosyncratic set of ideas about politeness and how to interact with others mostly based around avoiding them.

My fiance is extremely sensitive, when my family just behave like themselves he thinks they are being neglectful of him as a guest, that they are snubbing him, that they don't punish my brother enough for his open hostility and other similar things. While in many cases that might be true, my family don't understand that, they don't believe in punishment or rules - and though they may well be wrong, it's not something that's going to change. Privately both my parents express fondness for my partner, but they don't know how to express that in a way he recognises.

So there is tension and anger and pain on all sides, attempts at reconciliation are misunderstood and rebuffed, attempts to communicate fail because they're speaking different languages and I find myself so often stood in the middle trying desperately to be an interpreter and often failing to be heard over the din.

Even though I am asking about a specific situation though, I want more general advice. When you love people who do not like each other, or are even openly hostile to each other - how do you cope? Does the pain of it ever go away? Should you give up all hope for reconciliation one day? When you can see both sides of the story but everyone is tugging at you to pick their side? When someone is genuinely in the wrong but is never going to admit it and you *still* can't help loving them? Do you just have to be resigned that you will always have this pain to carry around? That you can never get together with everyone you love because it would devolve into a fight at best and a passive aggressive hate-fest at much much worst?

13198,Non-Romantic,2whti3,"Found a room off craigslist and moved in last September.  My roommate has a ps3 hooked up in the living room on the main tv.  He is the original owner of this ps3 that is first generation.  I played on it while both brothers are out working during the weekdays.  I never heard any complaints from any of them about how much I played. I felt some kind of support from the owner when I played on his console. The PS3 did freeze few times ever since I started to play.  The roommate would also play on his own or even with me then the ps3 would freeze sometimes too.  It was like once every 4 hours and it was usually enough for either one of us to put down the controller and do something else. It was Black Ops 2 that we played.

Then a friend of mine (from out of state) encouraged me to buy Advanced Warfare when it came out.  I couldn't really afford it then this same friend sent me money for me to go to a store to pick up this game so I could play with her over online.  We played often together then my roommate also played AW on his own as well.

Then one morning after I flew out of state for a week (Christmas) then returned.  The PS3 has refused to come on at all.  We never got ps3 working so I moved on doing other things instead of gaming on the roommate's ps3.

Because I decided to move out of the first week during next month - I asked about the game during last month.  I tried different methods to get the PS3 to spit out the game without opening it up.  None of the methods worked.  Then I shared this with the roommate about what I tried. I offered to take it apart and put it back together but he doesn't want this to happen because his warranty would be voided.  It's a first generation PS3 - one of the fattie ones.  So then it stayed sitting around near the living room TV with my friend's Advanced Warfare game stuck in it.  Few days ago, roommate mentions that he will try using his g/f's hairdryer to heat up the ps3 and try to get it out.  He tried this yesterday and nope, it didn't work.

Today, I asked him about the plan of action.  He says that he don't know what to do.  Then I ask, take it apart? Or replace the game? Then he complains about how it is my fault about the ps3 dying on him and that I should split the cost of replacing the game. He threatened to put in the cost of the game (and vaguely the ps3) into my next month's rent which includes the 5 days of the month. Now he is barraging me about how helpful he has been around the house and claiming that I was not helpful in this house (which isn't true).  I see it as him treating me like I'm a scapegoat.

My perspective is that I am seeing the ps3 the same thing as if it was a TV if I watched it all day and then suddenly TV died.  I don't see him blaming me for the TV dying.

How do I solve this?  Or how should I approach this to get this resolved? 

**tl;dr**: Roommate is claiming that I should split the cost for his ps3 being replaced because it is dead because of too much gaming on the ps3 that he claims being my fault because I gamed too much on it. Also there is a game stuck in the ps3 that belongs to a friend of mine that I need to return or take with me when I move out in 2 weeks.

EDIT AND UPDATE: Roommate came around and apologized. He decided to try to take the PS3 apart and got the game out. Gave it to me and asked me to forget all about what he said earlier. He wants to sleep on it.  I said, Okay! and gave him a big HIGH FIVE.","Me [35m] with my roommates (both are brothers) [late 20s M] since Sept, dispute over ps3 and a game.",0.0,False,3.0,5.0,1424393275.0,/r/relationships/comments/2whti3/me_35m_with_my_roommates_both_are_brothers_late/,NonRomantic

Since I came home for the summer after my first year at college, my mother will NOT stop asking me about my weight. It's either that or What did you eat today?, or if she sees me making food she'll come up behind me asking what I'm making in a really uncomfortable manner. I can't for the life of me understand why she's so fixated on my dietary habits. I'm neither fat nor underweight. Just thin, so there shouldn't be any cause for concern.

13223,Non-Romantic,3czuic,"Hello, I've had to use a throwaway because my brother and I post to reddit on the regular. 

My brother and I are extremely close. He's been dating a girl for over a year now and she comes from a broken home. She does not like associating with her parents or siblings, I think they were verbally abusive towards her. My brother lived at home with my parents and without asking, she's been living with my brother in his room for a good 6 months. They used to sit around, drink excessively and watch TV all day. She even thought it was a good idea to bring home 4 guinea pigs, without asking the permission of my parents, and have been raising them in my brother's room. It smelled like a zoo in there. 

He decided to join the military, and left for bootcamp. I had realized while here, she was reclusive, quiet and never spoke up. While he was away, the girl has been extremely obsessive and clingy. She had asked my parents for his cell phone, his computer password and decided to mail letters on behalf of some family; she wanted to be included. She would write letters to my brother urging him to get married and become pregnant once he graduated from bootcamp while he was on his 14 day leave, something I KNOW my brother would think is ridiculous. I had a gut feeling in my stomach that something was up. Turns out he took a marriage class during his rest days in bootcamp. 

The 14 day leave came and went, and with 2 days left, he told me that he had proposed to her, and I flipped my shit. I cried and told him it was a terrible idea. I know this girl is nice, however, I do believe she's piggybacking off my brother for his benefits, and sees her future as a military wife, and nothing beyond that. She's beyond the co-dependent behavior and my brother doesn't see it because he's away. My brother was disappointed in my reaction to him telling me he proposed, and I felt bad that I ruined his moment, I had hoped that he would meet a girl that the family liked. My parents share the same feelings I do, they've brought it up to me. They didn't say anything to my brother while he was here so they wouldn't stress your brother out. I told the girl to get her stuff together and to figure out her own life path, to be independent, instead of waiting for the day that my brother comes home. She cries everyday for him, and writes letters, it's strange to me how she behaves. She believes that they can have a baby and everything would be fine; she's not thinking about the real world. I told her things would not bode well for her if she screwed over my brother; I'm just being a protective older sister.

I love my brother to death, and I know it's his decision. However, I need to warn him that this behavior isn't ok, and I don't want him to hate me. What can I do? They haven't decided on a date just yet, but she's pushing the marriage thing FAST. He contracted for 5 years. She's ready to do it as soon as he finishes the second part of training. I know that marriages like these don't last. Relationships like these are simply unhealthy and I don't want to see my brother suffer down the road. I don't want to be the unhappy person at their wedding, I just want to slap my brother straight and open his eyes. I just can't see this person as my sister in law, and I'm afraid that this will put the biggest strain on my relationship with my brother. Please help me!

13228,Non-Romantic,3d5md6,"This sounds pathetic, but I really have no idea what's going on. This is my first time ever living on my own (besides the dorms in college) and in an apartment in the city. 

I've been living here for four months now. My apartment is on the ground floor of a complex that seems mostly filled with college grads or students. On either side of me are apartment A, with four 20-21 year old guys who also go to my college, and apartment B, with two older guys who are maybe 27-28. 

For the most part we all get along very well and if I'm at home alone, the guys in apartment A will text me and ask me to come over to watch movies or have a beer. This happens maybe 2-3 times a month, so I'd say we're pretty good friends at this point. The guys in apartment B (the older ones) keep to themselves but they've always been very friendly and helped me get my cat into his carrier one time. All nice people.

It started three weeks ago when the apartment B guys came over to my place and said that when they were walking their dog, they saw a tall guy trying to look through my living room windows (which has blinds). They didn't say anything to him but didn't recognize him and made a note to tell me. I didn't recognize their description of him: tall, sandy-hair, wearing a dark hoodie. I was freaked out and asked a friend to come over for dinner and a sleepover that night, but nothing else happened. I also asked them to let me know if they ever saw him again because I definitely did not know anybody by that description.

Then the guys in apartment A asked me if I had a new boyfriend. One of them said they saw him (tall blonde guy) standing outside on my porch once and another said he passed him in the hallway and was pretty sure he heard him go *into* my apartment (I was at school at the time). I started freaking out and telling them that I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THAT PERSON WAS and asking if I should call the police. They hastily said no, maybe they were mistaken, and one of them offered to come over and check my apartment to make sure he wasn't hiding anywhere or anything. It was fine...

After that, I became very paranoid and decided to set up my camera and point it to my front door whenever I left my apartment. I thought it might be a maintenance worker or someone from the landlord's office using their master key to come into my place. But it's been two weeks of filming and there has been no evidence of anyone coming in.

BUT I didn't tell the guys in apartment A about the camera... and a few days ago one of them told me he saw a guy leaving my apartment, but it didn't look like the same guy so he wasn't sure if he should confront him or not. I am so confused?! Because the camera hasn't shown ANYBODY except me coming or leaving my apartment...

I honestly want to cry. I don't know who to trust. The guys in apartment A do prank each other and are known to mess around, like they will play the mosquito ringtone when somebody is talking and then pretend to have no idea what he's talking about when he asks about the noise. But they've never pranked me and they seem genuinely nice. At the same time, they don't talk about the guy with much concern and don't act scared on my behalf when I tell them I don't know him--like they're not reacting as seriously as the guys in apartment B did. So I really don't know what's going on. 

I almost want to test them by asking them to help me file a police report... but could they really be making it up, when their initial description of the guy exactly matched the description of Apartment B's guys? And can I file a police report with just witness statements, when there's been no evidence of breaking and entering and I don't have anything missing AND there's no evidence of it on tape?
   
**tl;dr**: Two different sets of neighbors have told me that they've seen a strange man either hanging around my apartment or entering it when I'm not there. I set up a camera secretly and have found no evidence of this, though one of the neighbors claimed to see a man leaving my apartment while the camera was running. Nothing. I don't know if there's something I'm missing here, if one set of neighbors are just trying to scare me, or if both are and there never was a man. I want to trust them because they really seem like they're telling the truth, but I haven't seen any proof myself. 

EDIT: I am going to the police station tomorrow to talk to them. I talked to the Apartment A guys a little while ago and ended up breaking down and crying and saying that I was honestly scared, couldn't sleep, and that I had set up a camera but it hadn't captured anything even when they claimed they saw a guy leaving my apartment. The one who witnessed it admitted that the guy wasn't leaving my apartment per se, but was walking away from my door, so he assumed he'd been inside, but he could have just been trying to knob instead of locking up after himself like he assumed. Two of the guys offered to go to the police with me to provide their witness statements after they get done with work tomorrow. One also offered to sleep on my couch and we could just carpool to school from now on so I could feel safer. They are really nice guys and I feel ashamed that I suspected them of tricking me.","My neighbors (20s M) are either elaborately pranking me (20F), or I'm being stalked by a stranger.

13231,Non-Romantic,31hziv,"Okay, so my friend and I were the closest of friends for years, all through elementary and all through highschool. We've got high together, drunk together etc. We hung out pretty much every day.
Until about 3 years ago I had issues with my parents and I moved out and moved way across the other side of my city so I didn't really have a way to see him all the time since it was a really long bus ride.
So we start only chilling on the weekend, drinking with our buddies and stuff.
I've been going through emotional issues with myself recently and I get really angry drunk when I drink a lot. Apparentley to the point where I get in full yelling matches with my other friend's Mom about religion... Been doing better with that recentley and figuring out ways to stop myself from getting into debates.
 I've tried explaining this to my friend but it is like he doesn't care about anyone but himself. Or perhaps it's just me. He constantly says how selfless he is, yet he's ditched me to go to the bar 2 times. The first time I let him get away with it because he says his friends dragged him there and he was too drunk to realize what was going on.
The second time, I didn't have ID and they all knew, all my friends knew I was going to come chill with them that day.
When I finally get to one of my friends house they were all happy to see me and I joined in drinking with them.
Not even an hour goes by and Joe gets up and says they are going to the bar now.
I get up and say, dude you know I don't have I.D, so what do you expect me to do?

Basically they just made up this thing that if I go with them and I can't get in, they will come back.

And also, they apparently didn't think I was coming even though I sent my friend a message on Facebook saying OK, when he is the one who invited me.

So we get to the bar, I don't even bother trying to get in. I look like I'm 15 years old to some people.

I wait outside the bar for 25 minutes, or what felt like that, none of my friends came back out.

Long story short, I got my friend to come outside and he gets in my face about how its my fault or something I don't really remember what he said because it was just a lot of emotions and what not but all I know it sounded like a pile of crap.

He goes back into the bar and I never see him again, refuses to come outside and talk with me.
He hasn't seen that he has done anything wrong, nor do I ever think he will since I'm pretty sure he thinks he is some kind of God.

My other friends came to earlier too and said they were trying to convince him to come out, and he was just shrugging it off.

I don't really know what to think, since I have mental health issues and relationship problems seem to be a popular thing for me.

He drinks them in the morning, during the workday, and at night (a bit of facebook sleuthing clued me in to this). I really don't like him drinking them. I worry about his teeth, and his heart, along with all his other organs. I'm really worried and scared. He's a healthy 21 year old, but those energy drinks, especially the way he just pounds them back all day, day in, day out...I feel like I'm at my wit's end, and the kicker of course is that we're too shy to even talk to each other.

I give him reproachful looks when I see him drinking them. I think he senses that I don't really like him drinking them, because a few days ago he drank one in front of me with a smug look, as if to say I had no right to question him drinking so many energy drinks.

He's complained of headaches. I fear that they may be caused by this.

I'm curious, if he suddenly stopped, would he get cranky, like people giving up cigarettes? I imagine his bloodstream must be 90 percent caffeine by now.

13245,Non-Romantic,2fu83b,"6 years ago my friends and I got together and threw a bachelor party for our good friend. The groom was sort of an outdoorsman, so instead of the typical gambling\stripper party we found and rented a property in upstate New York that has two rustic houses on a small lake. We stayed the weekend, Friday afternoon through Sunday, and just hung out, barbequed, drank, played board games, chopped wood, made a fire, and other typical manly things. We had so much fun that every year since we’ve returned to the property in September, only in subsequent years we’ve encouraged everyone to invite their wives, girlfriends, and any additional friends that might want to come. This year we had 19 people total. Everyone brings some food or alcohol, or both, and we all share in the bounty. The last two years I brought my laptop and a karaoke program, and I set it up on the Saturday night when we were driven inside because of rain. There’s never a set agenda on what to do, everyone just does their own thing. Some people spend hours playing board games, others go swimming or kayaking when the weather permits. You eat when you’re hungry, sleep when you’re tired. The weekend has become one of our most cherished traditions, and every year we look forward to it as the time approaches. It’s also one of the few opportunities we have to get together as a group.


Since it’s been 6 years, we’re all in our early thirties now and a few of our friends have gotten married and started having children. 2 years ago, one of our friend’s wives posted on the Facebook event page asking if anyone else was bringing their children. This started a debate\argument between the husband and wife, and some of the guys in our group (myself included) who did not want to include children in the event. The main argument that was initially made was that the environment was not safe for children, because of the lake, the fire pit, and because everyone is usually drunk the entire time. No one ever outright stated that anyone was forbidden from bringing their kids, but I think the couple interpreted it that way. The argument spiraled out of control, and the couple in question decided not to come that year, and haven’t been back since. The discussion was brought up again at the end of this year’s trip this past weekend, since the guy that organized the bachelor party 6 years ago just had a baby, and decided not to come this year (the baby is only a few months old, he wanted to stay home rather than spend an entire weekend away). We sat around in the living room of one of the houses and talked about it for about 20 minutes.


During the discussion one of my friends said that it is an inevitability that children are going to be part of our lives from this point forward (even though most of us don’t have kids and a bunch of us are still single), and though there are only a few couples right now with kids, as time goes on we’d have to include them eventually. I made the argument that including kids would basically change the entire tone of the weekend from a carefree end of summer excursion to the main focus being on the children. If you’ve ever been to a BBQ or party with small children, you know that the main focus is always on them regardless of what’s going on. You need to make sure they’re safe, make sure they’re fed, make sure they’re entertained, etc. And although that responsibility ultimately falls on the parents, I feel like that shift of focus would bleed into the rest of the weekend. I and a few others also consider the weekend to be a vacation, one of the few we actually take throughout the year, and we’ve said that we don’t want to be around children when we’re on vacation. The group is sort of torn on the matter. Some of us vehemently oppose it, others are strongly in favor of it, and some are indifferent.


I’m certain the issue will be brought up next year during the event planning, so what do you think Reddit? Am I being unreasonable in asking that we keep the weekend child free, or is this one of those eventualities that I’ll have to accept as we get older? Or should I and the other like-minded people scrap the whole argument and just start our own weekend trip, with blackjack, and hookers?

As some background on this, he eluded to progressing health problems but largely kept the full scope hidden from immediate family members. His relationship with his wife has been frequently volatile. While he was healthy I respected him as an adult to choose for himself the life he lived, leaving it at 'really dude?' and vocalizing my thoughts when things got weird. I drew the line when his health failed. Concern grew until local police were sent out to do a wellness check. Based on their findings he was removed from the home.

I was able to move fast enough when things started to secure half of his savings account, his spouse had withdrawn the other half of their joint account. He has retirement accounts with sufficient funds, however the first thing her lawyer did was put a freeze on these accounts pending completion of the divorce. 

His wife ran out of funds and is no longer represented; however, the freeze on accounts stands. It's become clear that she has taken a strategy of dragging on the divorce for as long as possible. She makes requests for documentation / information then will not respond to calls from my fathers lawyer, claims to not receive faxes or mail sent to her address, tries to avoid certified mail, then responds by stating requests have gone unmet. Perhaps she's simply trying to burn as much of his money as possible on legal fees as well as health care. Maybe she thinks he'll simply pass on and she'll receive a larger payout. Who knows. 

To the point -- my fathers surplus has been exhausted from assisted living, medical, and legal fees. 

His finances are at a place where I can make small payments on his behalf in good-faith but unable to stay current with mounting bills. His continued residence in assisted living is becoming difficult without larger payments made. 

On my end I am exploring alternative options, but the degree of mental incompetence, inability to walk, and need for help with basic care does not come much cheaper than the current situation. Really it's the medical costs that are the concern, these are less predictable and more likely to drive up costs. 

**Were he to be kicked out tomorrow, what happens?** 

Are there nursing homes or care facilities he would be moved to? How does that work when a disabled individual can't pay? We have no family members available able to take him in. Hell, I live up two flights of stairs often working 60 hour weeks which at times requires travel. 

My current strategy is just communicate openly, honestly, and often with every creditor involved. I'm working with my fathers legal representation to try and move things along but it just moves so slow. One thought is that while married his wife remains the guarantor on many of his bills, so when the whole house of cards tumbles that falls onto her as much as anyone, there should be some incentive to push things forward quickly. Just not seeing much progress in nearly a year now.

Any advice and pointers in the right direction to useful information would be greatly appreciated here. Between work, study, sleep, the fourth responsibility of caring for my father is a heavy burden.

I want to move to my mom's, since she happens to live in Annapolis, which is where my dream college, The Naval Academy, is. I currently live in a backwater town in central Florida, with no opportunities whatsoever, except for the International Baccalaureate Program at my high school (which I'm not in anyways, since none of the Service Academies look at anyways). Annapolis is a much better place, with more just *things* in general; in addition to a better education (I may go to a Military Boarding School) and social setting. Also, my mom is a better person in general, being open about her mistakes and leveling with me, while my dad is a shady car dealership manager that constantly smokes dope and is an avid bullshitter about his mistakes and what he's done.

So now that you have the backstory, it seems obvious that my mom's is a better place; so now onto the limiting factor. My Father. We've talked about the issue, and his entire reasoning is that *here* is a better place, with nothing to back it up. He doesn't even have custody of me, I was just forced to live here because my mom moved due to her losing her house. He has the illusion that I love it here, and that he has full custody of me. 

My main dilemma is this: I want to live with my mom for sure, but my father won't willingly let me go. My mom is willing to take it to court, but all the files and papers she needs are down here in Florida. The case itself might not take long, being that I'm of age to decide with whom I live with (and that there have been custody battle before, all of which my father has lost) but the arrangement of it will.

My brother has been hanging out with a few kids the last month or so who seem like they're a very bad influence on him. They are all around my brothers age, or a year younger or so. They are also my neighbours. One of them, Jake, is homeschooled as of this year because he kept skipping class to smoke weed when he actually attended a high school. (During his first year). He still smokes weed, and every time I am walking around the neighbourhood with my dog, he is high as a kite. The other one, Brian, lives in a foster home. I have never met this kid, I only know his name and that he lives around the corner. The other one, John, I've known for a while and also smokes a lot of weed. He is a very troublesome kid. I have heard from Jake that he gets into a lot of arguments at school and with his parents.

I have nothing against weed, I remember I tried it a few times when I was in high school, I am only worried because I know those boys tend to do crazy things when they are under the influence. As far as I know, my brother does not smoke weed and never has. He has always been such an innocent kid. My brother and Jake have known each other since they were 5-6 years old and my brother has always walked away whenever Jake suggested doing crazy idea that could cause trouble. I asked him recently why he is starting to hang out with these boys if he stays away from those certain things, and he said it's because he likes to go out with his friends.

However, something happened today that made me think my brother might be falling under their influence. My Brother left the house at 3pm to meet up with Jake. He was gone the entire afternoon and evening. Later at 10pm My boyfriend (also my neighbour) had just left my house to go home. My brother still hadn't returned home so my BF told me he would call me if he sees him outside.

Apparently, when my boyfriend was walking home he saw a man scolding my brother and Jake. He was accusing them of running around the neighbourhood trying to break into cars. My boyfriend went up to the man, and told him that my
Brother couldn't have been involved in this because he knows he is a good kid. My boyfriend told my brother to go home because we were worried about his whereabouts. 

What I find weird is that my brother told my BF that it was Brian and John who were breaking into the cars, not him and Jake. But Brian and John were not even there when the man was scolding my brother... unless they ran home or something. 

It doesn't make sense to me that the man claimed to see two people trying to break into cars and caught my brother and Jake, when my brother claims it was Brian and John.

My brother doesn't know that I know about this situation. I don't know if he told my boyfriend to keep it a secret. Later that night my mom came in and asked me to make sure the cars are locked because my brother told her two guys are running around trying to get into cars but did not tell her these two guys are his friends. I do not know what my brother has been up to with these boys, I do not want to accuse him, but I also don't feel he is really all that innocent. How can I protect my brother and talk to him about being safe and making good decisions without making him feel scared or upset that I know about what happened? We don't have a very good relationship but he is my little brother. 

TLDR: My brother hangs out with 3 bad influences. Him and 1 friend got caught by a neighbour for breaking into cars but my brother told me it was his other two friends who did it. How can I protect my brother from bad influences and teach him to make smart choices without making him feel.. accused or upset?

Anyway, it's pretty straightforward.  I really, really dislike my boyfriend's best friend's (we'll call him Todd) girlfriend (Amanda). They've been dating for about three months. She's annoying, vapid, and noisy. She also complains about everything all the time. It wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't stuck having to socialize with her a lot because everyone in my boyfriend's friend circle has been together since high school, and sometimes the female population can be sort of left out.  I don't really have a problem with this otherwise, as the girl Todd dated before was really cool--as are most of the other guys' girlfriends. I like and get along well with them, so I really think it's a, it's not me, it's you situation.

We all go to a bar trivia night sometimes, maybe a couple nights a month. Lately, I've not been going, because Amanda is going to be there. I've also started to avoid going to Todd's house, or functions where he and his girlfriend are going to attend.  

Basically, should I tell my boyfriend about this? I suspect that he's wise to it, as he hasn't really put up too much of a fuss about my sudden introversion (not that I'm super extroverted to begin with....). I also suspect that he may not like her too much. But I don't want to put him in an awkward situation. Also, what can I do about my dislike of her? Just continue to avoid situations where I'd be along with her and hope they break up? Any advice would be appreciated.

13307,Non-Romantic,2spnhj,"So I'm going to be turning 35 in over a month. Every year for the past many many years, I've had big birthday parties at my parents' home where 35-50 friends would come. I would kind of feel like it was my own popularity contest, wanted all my friends to come and if they didn't show up I'd be mad at them.


Over the last few years I've been working more and have become more introverted. The last few years, and even to a lesser extent all the years where I had parties, I would get very anxious beforehand and be super scattered during the parties, not knowing who to connect with because so many great people were there. It was never really a pleasant experience for me but I had these parties anyway.


I've had a great boyfriend for a year and a half and Ive become even more introverted during this time. Never have I socialized so little. So now it's about to be my birthday, and to me 35 is a big one. But I don't know how to celebrate it. I'm thinking something with like 10 people, but then I would feel bad discluding other people.


All of this is part of the bigger problem I'm having which is transitioning from a serious people person/extrovert to being more domesticating, working more and wanting to be alone or with my boyfriend in my spare time. I'm one of those people who collects friends from all periods of my life. And I'm likeable so a lot of people want to be and stay friends with me.

We are very close, we do everything together, see eachother nearly every day, and we have been discussing moving in together as roommates for some time now.  Our relationship is completely non-sexual.  I don't touch him, he doesn't touch me, no one flirts, in the 8 years I've known him I've never once seen him check me out or anything so it isn't like he likes me at all.  

So last night we were talking about how a lot of our other friends are unfaithful and he said that he doesn't see the point of getting into a relationship because of what he sees going on with all of the people we know.  Then he says well as long as niether of us has anyone we should just live together, I would be happy living with you for all my life.  Then it later moved on to about if he did get a girlfriend she'd have to like me and let us hang out or he'd tell her to fuck off.

i stayed at his house that night and the next day we have this conversation:
Friend: Thank you jess
Me: for what?
Friend: For the gift

I'd love to live with him and all but I'm kinda fearful that I have some how become a life preserver to him.  I'm someone he's comfortable with so wrather than seeking out other relationships he is content to have me be there for him emotionally and his right hand for the sex.  His plans for the future usually involve me being with him to support him/guide his descions and I guess I don't want to be responsible for him not living his life out fully because he sees me as always there and such a huge amount of his happiness seems to be dependent on me.    I'm not really sure what to do.  i 'm not going to quit being his friend, that isn't an option. but he can't just expect me to be there for him all the time and live with him for an indefinite amount of time, and be his source of happiness while being just his friend forever.

Initially, she texted my husband/her big brother that she needed $1,500 for an emergency, and couldn't tell him what it was for. She did not tell her own husband or their parents. She promised to pay it back. He sent it to her and then told me after the fact.

At the time, I was a bit annoyed that he didn't consult me first but shrugged it off; over the years I've had to lend money to my own family members (e.g. when my younger brother couldn't afford a car repair) and my experience is that it's probably not going to be paid back, but you should help out when someone is in a jam. It was weird, though, that she didn't say what it was for and my husband didn't push her on it. 

But then little requests from her started coming, a couple hundred bucks at a time. Most of the time my husband would just give it to her. I told him that we're not a damn bank, and he raised the issue with her, but her line is that she'll for sure pay it back, and that we can afford it.

Both she and my husband are not very good with money and can be impulse shoppers, since they were raised as the only two kids by relatively well-off parents; I was raised poor with a boatload of siblings so I tend to be tighter about money.

My mother[57f] and father[60m] are both extremely mentally ill and unstable. My brother[31M] and I[21F] grew up in an extremely abusive household because of this. I've been away for 4, nearly 5 years now, and mostly minimized contact with them.   I live 2000 miles away from them, roughly.  I'm happily married to a really wonderful and supportive person, and things are pretty good right now, aside from this issue with my parents. 



My dad had a struggle with cancer about 7 years ago, and had a large part of his lungs removed. After continuing to smoke for another five years after that, he had to have open heart and some vein stints and other procedures done. Things were fine again until early last year, where he got sick (some sort of soil bacteria got in his lungs?) and was hospitalized for four or five months, and had to re-learn to walk.  Recently, he's been sick again and after going to the hospital we got the news that his oxygen levels are dropping significantly in his sleep, and that he's probably going to die in his sleep in the next month or so.



Sob story aside, I don't feel any fondness for either of my parents because of the living hell that they put me through for most of my life. My mom was the major source of the abuse, but my dad also contributed his own share.  I won't really go into specifics with it, but it was physical, verbal and emotional. I've since been to a therapist but I still have strong trauma from it.

My mother kept mentioning vague regrets about raising me and so on and so forth when I talked to her the few times over the phone, and switched over to this somewhat saccharine doting mode when we had communication. A week or so ago, I called to tell her that I'm not comfortable being around them or coming home, and that I don't know if I'll visit my dad before he dies at all. She broke out into tears and told me that she was sorry for **whatever she had done**, and that she'd try to make it up to me.  **It's important to note that she was speaking extremely vaguely at this point, and trying to deflect the issues about what I was talking about.** 



 We got into a discussion that, for a moment, sounded like she was apologizing for whatever she had done but then when I started bringing up the specific abuse I went through, and the specific things they've done to my brother and I,  the conversation took a 180.



Suddenly all those “apologies” were thrown out, and she began screaming at me about how none of this had ever happened / I was making shit up, just like when I tried to talk to the social worker. *(I tried to get taken out of their custody when I was in middle school, but DHR is kind of a joke.)*



Once I told her that I wasn’t falling for it,  and that I could confirm with my brother every instance of abuse, she changed tactics and instead began screaming at me telling me I deserved it and it was for my own good.  It was “for my own good” that she hit me so much, because I’m the one that “started the fights”.

3 weeks ago I accidentally drank more than I was suppose to. Had gone through a recent break up. Ran into a buddy of mine that i was attracted to at a bar while wasted. My friends have previously fed me some information that him and his current gf were not actually together but she really wanted to be official. 

Story:
I am unsure what I said to him. I think we talked about sexual preferences I think? I don't know. I was really wasted. I am so embarrassed of that night because I shouldn't have said those things. I don't remember anything. I know for sure I did not touch him in a sexual manner. 

Two weeks later I run into them. He seems to greet me with the same friendliness but she tried to be rude to me every chance she gets. She will physically leave when I am just trying to make small talk. No one seems to hate me from that night except her. Most people seem to laugh about that night. 

Should I ask next time why she's being rude to me? Or should I let it slide? I feel bad if I offended her. Did I just offend everyone but she's the only honest one? She keeps bringing up how drunk I was but no one else does. I am too embarrassed to ask what I said...

This whole ordeal started in the summer when my Mother found that I had cough syrup (DXM) that I was going to experiment with and try to trip off. I had done lots of research and wanted to try it. My friend and I both agreed to try it but made a pact to never let the other get addicted, do too much and we have to do it together so we know we're safe. This was the first time she threaten to not let me go to college as this occurred about 2 weeks before I was scheduled to leave for college. But she did allow me to go in end. 


Shortly after I moved to college my Mom moved to Michigan which is about an 8 hour drive away from where we lived in New York while I was in high school. Her motive for moving was to go live with her sister who had moved there a couple years prior and needed her help to keep the house. While I on the other hand moved about 2 hours in the opposite direction for school.


Now flash forward to me coming home for the holidays on break between semesters. She buys me the cheapest transportation method as we are quite poor. This happens to be a train that makes the 10 hour drive into 20 hours of train riding. It was so long because the cheapest ticket involved a layover as well as having to back track as the first train went past where my mom moved to. Also note I hate traveling, its so boring and I get so fidgety, I cant stand it!

I voiced my opinion about my hate for traveling and zero desire to ever taking the train again to my mom and we discuss a quicker way back to college as we haven't made my plans for returning yet because we didnt have the money for a round trip. 

A couple of days later my mom says that my grandma just called her and told her that I messaged my cousin asking if he was still able to get LSD as he said he could get it once before.  My grandma saw these messages because my phone is broken so I was using her phone to check Facebook. We didnt get to discuss this in full because my siblings interrupted while we were talking about it.  


A few days after this we make plans to drive back to New York to pick up my aunts daughter who has been living with her boyfriend but didn't have a means of getting to see her mom for the holidays. This was another very long trip after I had already voiced to my mom how much I hate them, but she insisted on me going so I did with little fight as she says she might need me to drive as I'm the only other licensed driver in the house.

 I ended up only driving 3 hours of the trip, all after we had picked up my cousin, her boyfriend and my cousins dad. After picking them up though, we find out that my cousins boyfriend had been sleeping all day waiting for us to pick them up because he had planned on driving if needed, as he is also a licensed driver (My cousin and her dad are not). This makes me pretty angry as the main reason I went was to be a backup driver when I didn't even drive there and then we picked up a driver. But since neither of us even thought about it so I cant really blame her for that one.
 

About a week later she accuses me of smoking weed with my aunt who she knows smokes it. After she threatens to drug test me (she actually bought me a marijuana drug test and put it in my Christmas stocking) I admit that I would absolutely fail as I have smoking weed quite frequently without her knowing. 

In attempt to save my aunts ass I said I brought what I smoked from home and she instantly says if that's true then I am stupid and making terrible decisions because I took it with me on the train and transported it over state lines. The only thing I really did transport was my paraphernalia which I store in a container that is air tight and covers up the odor very well and the train security didnt check any luggage so it was no problem, although not the brightest move. 

We end up having a talk with my dad on the phone (parents were never married and no longer together) about both the LSD as well as weed. My moms argument is that weed is illegal and a terrible drug that leads to dependency, in the sense that some people feel like they need it just to feel normal. 

During the talk my dad asks what is the strike limit, is it like baseball where you get 3 strikes? My mom says that she doesn't know and that this might be the last strike because she doesn't know how she can trust me not to be stupid at college. My mom was skeptical the entire time about my story of bring the weed with me on the train and believed it was her sister who had supplied me (yep) and said that if it was in fact my aunt, that she would cease to have a sister.

Yesterday, starting a couple hours before its time to leave I inform my mom I will not be going on the trip with them to drop her off. I have done way too much traveling in the past 10 days and am not even required as a driver since my cousins boyfriend was able and willing to drive. 

She takes my first attempts at getting out of the trip very lightly as if I'm joking and laughs at me. This makes me more mad and more stubborn to the point were I end up hiding from her, in her room when she thinks that I'm in the room I normally sleep in. One of my cousins (not the one going home) tells where I am. 

She refused to leave without me still after an approximately 30 min stand off and then has everyone that is trying to go home persuade me to come although they all admit they are on my side about not having to come but say my mom is psycho and will not go with out me (My mom is so damn controlling of everything and everyone and rules like a dictator, her word being above all other, always. The household opinion of my mother is very negative as she is bitchy to everyone)

She tells me that I have to go or else she definitely wont let me go to school, this fight involves a lot of yelling at each other and arguing but I continue to refuse as it turns into me needing to take a stand again my mom who has been very controlling my entire life always forcing me to go with her places I hate going. She tells me that if I dont get into the car I will not be leaving Michigan any time soon. But I still see this as a battle I need to win to stand up for myself and refuse her a final time as she is pulling away.

Now I am here writing this waiting for her to get back from the trip and bite my head off. My cousin has already informed me via facebook that my mom has no plans of letting me go back to college and likely has plans of making me stay here and go to community college so that she can keep an eye on me, in addition to getting a job among other adult like things, as one of my arguments was that I am an adult now and she cannot force me to go on this car trip that I am going to absolutely despise and not needed for. My cousin also said that during the car ride my mom said this was my strike 3 and that I was done.

What do I do with this situation? I refuse to go to community college as I am at a very nice school in a very nice program and view her choice to use not letting me go to college as very detrimental to not only my education but to my future because this would very likely force my career path in a different direction.

TL;DR: I used all 3 of my 'strikes' and my mom now says that I can't go back away to college because she needs to watch me.

I met this guy at work, he's married has kids. I'm married and have a kid. We got to be friends and then things started to get weird. He started to give me gifts. My birthday, if he went away on vacation, Christmas. I asked my husband if he thought it was weird. He initially said it wasn't. They were small gifts, my colleague got them for his one other female friends as well that I know of. So I decided to not think anything of it.        
     
There was a time when I was having trouble with my husband and contemplated divorce. Since he was a friend, I went to him for male perspective as I didn't have many other male friends. I told him I was going to move back to my hometown with my son. He asked if he could visit. I said I didn't know if I had enough room for him and his whole family, but he said he wanted to come alone. That's when things got really weird. I didn't think that was appropriate. 
  
I confronted him and asked him if he had feelings for me. He said he didn't, that I was a close friend and that was it. So we tried to be friends but I tried to be less friendly with him and kind of disengage. He started writing these long emails to me. He was all over the place in them. He'd be mean, he'd say he missed me and our friendship, he get upset if I didn't pay him attention. Getting upset that I wasn't talking to him as much, wouldn't go out to lunch with him anymore, etc. The whole time I tried to be professional. I had to work with him, so I would say I wanted to be his colleague but no more than that. Everyone once in a while he'd say really hurtful things to me, and would say he hoped I'd leave the company, etc and that he didn't  want to talk to me anymore, etc. Eventually I just said I didn't want anything to do with him, that I'd say hello if I passed him in the hall, but didn't want to talk anymore or be his friend. It was too much drama for me, and was my husband was upset on my behalf. When my colleague learned I had told my husband about what he'd written in his emails, my colleague was upset and said that I didn't need to tell my husband every little thing especially since it was making my husband angry with him. I said that wasn't the kind of marriage I was in, that I had done nothing wrong, and that I didn't hide things from my husband, and he could from his wife, but I wasn't into that. He left the company I worked for, it was a huge relief. Finally the drama was out of my life.   

Sometimes he'd still email me or messaged me. Saying he wanted to be friends again. He emailed me at work, on facebook (none of which I replied to)  and eventually messaged me over my personal messenger service. At that time saying he wanted to be friends and that he was sorry for what happened. I said Thanks, but no thank you the time his messaged my personal account. I didn't want to be friends, it was too much drama for me, but wished him the best.
      
However now I've got a very good offer to go work at a new company, one that he happens to work for. One that when he was hired, he was given a promotion and he could potentially be my boss if I'm assigned to his project.  He's since found out that I accepted the offer and he has recently wrote me another email asking to call me that he thinks we should work things out between us because we will be working together. In it he also writes how he misses me and wishes we could say hello to each other instead of having ignored each other like I do when I see him around town.    
     
I don't want to be his friend, I think he may be emotionally unstable and is sort of clingy/ possessive but don't want it to impact my future job. My husband hates him and wants to talk to him about leaving me alone. It's put my in an awkward position. What should I say to him to keep things peaceable but let him know I don't want to be friends?

Edit: I just wanted to say that there was a huge finical incentive to take this job, which would really help our family out. I did think about not accepting it, but after speaking with my husband we both agree that I should let this former colleague dictate my life and which opportunities I accepted. Additionally it is a big company with many projects and there is a good chance that I wouldn't be working with him, but there is a chance I would be too. He would be in a leadership role, but not be my real manger. (As in he couldn't fire me, etc. but could express how I was doing on the project.) I personally don't think he would say something against me because we weren't getting on to management, but he might make things uncomfortable by trying to be friends with me and trying to get this back to us being friendlier.

13512,Non-Romantic,2kphyr,"Hello! This may be a bit lengthy, but I apologize, so here goes.

I met my Roommate in our college dorms, and he was usually a positive guy, where he did complain about things, but every so often. He then dated this girl for a week, and the she broke up with him, which utterly destroyed him. A buddy and I helped him through it, and It took him about 6 months since he saw her in the dorms almost every day, and he never had a real relationship. After summer and he went home, he couldn't afford housing, so him, the buddy that helped him with the break up, and myself got an apartment together so he could continue to go to college.

He seemed a bit happier, and at first everything was good. But as time went on he's become a constantly negative person and I'm starting to think he's depressed. My other Roomate is a psychology major, and I've been around psychologists in my life, and we can't seem to help him with any of his issues or understand him mentally. Currently he's doing school, a part time job (he didn't get much financial aid so he has to work to pay rent) , and volunteering. And as of lately he hasn't been paying us back for bills. He used to pay them normally, but now he gets all pissy and complains that he has to pay us back for bills. I tried to sit him down and talk about it, but he started crying, and then turned it into how he wants a girlfriend, rather than if he's having financial troubles.

Another thing is that he hurt his knee last year, and he walks around and plays basketball fine, but the doctor suggested surgery, and he feels like he's incapable of doing physical things. Even though he said he feels fine, he said he's going to get the surgery. Which will probably make him incapable of work for a month, so now my other Roomate and I have to cover his rent. Which sucks ALOT, but he's my buddy so I don't mind.

So, in conclusion, I think he may be stressed out? But he does rend to GREATLY exaggerate his problems. He even told me he feels like we can't afford food, when we've been cooking hearty dinners every night without a problem. And his mom had an affair on his dad when he was young, which he hates her for, but I've heard so many more horrible life changing stories, that I can't really comprehend why he's so destroyed by every little thing. And when he asks anyone for advice he tends to take it in for a day, and then circles exactly back to where he started. I'm trying my best to understand and help him, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it, and I'm afraid he's depressed even though everyday I try my best to cheer him up.

Thank you for reading this, and if you need any more info on this situation, please ask and I will gladly oblige.

EDIT: Do you think seeing a counselor might be good for him? We have a counseling service on campus, and I'm considering asking him to get professional help.

13525,Non-Romantic,28cn1l,"After struggling with depression my first semester away at college, I gained 30 lbs and promptly transferred to a commuter school. You could say I was a bit of a headcase. When I was home, with all my other friends away, I reached out to a girl that I was friends with all throughout highschool. We didn't go to highschool together, but we met while I was in 9th grade and maintained a friendship, but not a very close one all throughout till my graduation (we are the same age/grade fyi). I guess I reached out to her because I was lonely, and she wasn't going to college and was available. We began hanging out, and I quickly saw a lot of similarities. Well, one big one. We were both massively depressed and unhappy with our lives. I was more optimistic about the future (although my psych says I need to start living in the present more, and he is right), but she was pretty much resigned to a life of misery (probably stems from her social anxiety which is pretty bad).
Anyway I'll cut to the chase. This girl and I hungout very much through the months of January to Mid April. I'm talking 4-5 times a week. It started off once or twice on Friday and Saturday, but very quickly it progressed to a point where I could not stand to be with her all the time. A lot of the dependency I formed was no doubt due to my mental health, and I'm sure the reasons this neediness was so well received was because she might be attention-starved (dont read this as attention seeking; I mean no one ever gave her the attention she deserved and it feels good for once). When we hangout, nothing sexual has ever happened. We often just drive around, usually meeting up around 9pm and driving and talking until 2 or 3. The latest I've ever stayed out with her was from 8pm to 5am. We're really comfortable with one another, and I feel a lot of sexual tension between us.


I'm really confused about how to approach this relationship. On the one hand, we really have a fun and great friendship. But I would be lying if I said I thought of her just as a friend, and I think she feels the same way. I'm dealing with a few major obstacles however: first, I worry that a relationship based on treating eachother as emotional gratification is built on bad foundation. Second, I know due to her SA that making a move could make her very uncomfortable. Lastly, I still haven't gotten over my own demons. I still hate myself, both on a superficial level and a mental one.


I know this sounds like I'm ranting, and I'm sorry if I am a little bit. What I am asking you guys is maybe some insight or personal experience or even outsider advice on my situation? I plan to work on myself first (beat this depression, get into better shape, etc.). Maybe I'll cool down the time I spend with her during the summer and pick things up again later in the year around Winter? I don't think this is one of those creepy friendzone situations where a guy misinterprets friendship for sex. There is chemistry between us of that I have no doubt. I just don't know the best way to execute this, considering the obstacles of my own self-hatred and self esteem, her anxiety issues, and the whole turning a friendship into something more debacle.

The other day, my friend texted me to ask if I would like him to dog-sit over the weekend, as my boyfriend and I will be attending a program-wide event, and my friend doesn't want to go. On the one hand, I would love for my dog to have company that night, but on the other, this would mean allowing my friend into my apartment, and leaving him there alone. 

I tend to be fairly oblivious in situations like these, but I'm worried that this might cross some type of line of relationship propriety, as he would obviously have access to the entire apartment (including my bedroom). Would telling him okay be unfair to my boyfriend?

13544,Non-Romantic,3h9tgd,"Apologies in advance as I'm not good at this.
I've been close friends with the Bride since we were 16, we met at school, she is also my hairdresser. I am one of 3 other bridesmaids.
BM1 - childhood friends with the bride. 
BM2 - is also a close friend from school to both the bride and I.
I am going to leave BM2’s input of things out of this just incase this thread is discovered.

I'll start of explaining the kind of person we find the bride and what she also try's to portray herself if that helps. The bride seems to be a very controlling personality, everything in her is planned scheduled months in advance. She blames (self diagnosed) anxiety for it. A lot of things cause her stress, she has trouble sleeping and always is getting sick. She's always working over every detail for everything event wise. She can't be spontaneous and budgets for everything. I feel like this is why we don't suit being friends.  

I have so much to say about the past few years but I am going to try and only stick to addressing the hens night (baring in mind it was a full day starting from 11am till 12am) 
In saying that, the last few years I feel the bride showing her true colours, some are more negative than positive traits that I don't value in a person/friendship. Maybe it's the way she was raised or maybe no one has had the courage/been bothered to address her behavior before, I don't know. I didn't previously have the heart/energy/time to try and figure it all out so that's why I may have seemed distant/or quickly resolved/cooled things over with her in the past (I've been starting a family/working on my business/living life)..but now this has happened I feel it needs to be addressed right now before I unintentionally hurt her feelings even more. I have a large feeling of resentment against her that is coming to a head now. I don't go out of my way to upset people, but everyone makes mistakes and has poor judgment, especially while drinking. I am not going to deny you going to see another close friend on 'her' night would make her upset. Given that, I had thought how I would feel about it myself and came to the conclusion that I wouldn't mind because we're all adults who can do as we please within reason. 

On to what happened:  I had at some stage during the night had go home and feed my son and settle him. On my way to returning to the hens party, I briefly stopped into another one of my own close friends' birthday party that was literally just around the corner from where the hens night was being held. Once I returned to the hens party I was confronted by some of the other ladies saying the Bride was crying saying that everyone was leaving her to sneak off to other events. I went to see that she was fine and happily dancing but when I went to approach her (to ask why all of the girls were telling me she was crying because of me) but at the same time I was getting glared at by her cousin (making me feel unwelcome) so I turned around and went back to where the other bridesmaids were to get filled on on what actually happened.
 Then one of the guests felt the need to get right in our faces and start berating us saying something along the lines of “this isn’t your night, its (the brides name)’s, stop making it about you”  So after that I decided to leave.

I know she is lying in her messages to me as I and BM2 noticed only 2 people leave (only 16 out of the 40 she invited came), and then another leave to go to the same birthday party I visited only after the planned events for the hens had finished and we were all just celebrating. I was gone for no more than and hour and a half max to feed my child and visit my friend. When I told her earlier on in the night that another one of the guests (also my friend) had gone to the other party, the bride pouted and poked her tongue out. I found it to be a really immature reaction? I might be wrong though? So when she had found out had attended the other party she started making a scene crying to the other guests/bridesmaids about me/“everyone” leaving her. here are the said messages:


I'm just going to copy and the texts from the next day:

From the bride: (names deleted for privacy) 
&gt;Hey I just wanted to clear the air about last night... I'm not sure what was said to you but what happened is that I got upset that you left my hens night to go to (my other friend)'s party. I know you have a responsibility for your children and I had no issues with you leaving to feed (my child) and I appreciated you telling me where you were going coz so many people just bailed on me and didn't say good bye and then I found out went to other events and snuck off and then when someone mentioned you were at (the venue) for (other friend)'s party I burst into tears as I just didn't understand why my bridesmaid who had been gone for ages was not there with me on my one special night to be with you all. I feel like I missed a huge chunk of time with you as then you had to leave again to go home to feed and you didn't tell me or say goodbye and I felt like I hardly seen you and got to celebrate together. I know this may sound silly but I have so much respect for you girls and I just know that you would want me there with you and to share the beautiful night together. I also wanted to personally thank you for everything last night. I did have a really amazing night and I seen all the effort you guys put in for me and I truly appreciate it. I hope this hasn't caused our friendship to be ruined but I just needed to explain what happened as you know how stories get twisted. I hope you had a good night too xx

I used a lot of restraint and replied with:

&gt;So I am going to be frank here by saying we are adults (or so I thought), but I am a tad angry at what happened last night before I went. The way it played out and what I experienced  was akin to a group of high school girls' drama - which I enjoy hearing about (who doesn't) but definitely not being apart of. Please know I don't go out of my way to upset people, but everyone makes mistakes and has poor judgment, especially while drinking.  Given that, thinking rationally about how I would feel, I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't mind because we're all adults who can do as we please within reason. Even if it was a mistake to think that, I didn't expect or deserve the shit I received last night, being made to feel the way I did and I am so pissed off that I am having to justify myself now. Regardless of that, I'm glad you had a great night. I definitely did too. Sorry that you are feeling this way, but I needed time to calm down, process my thoughts and not say anything that I didn't mean and later regret saying.


Then the bride replied:

&gt;I'm sorry you feel that way. Long story short there was a lack in communication which lead to a miscommunication between a lot of people and others getting involved for no reason at all and which to my knowledge I didn't even know happened. As I said earlier I wanted to clear the air as I had been informed that you were upset and I am the type of person who resolves problems and wanted to make sure you were ok and everything will be fine. I honestly was fine with everything I was actually holding a lot of stresses inside at times and I get a bit of social anxiety at times so maybe that showed too and I'm sorry if that was noticed.

**Baring in mine these may be more of her fiances words than her's as she probably has trouble getting her thoughts into words, and BM2 was with here while discussing what happened and she heard him say these exact things.**


That was yesterday afternoon and I've just been to busy to reply or think about it since. I've been discussing it with BM2 a lot and she has really helped me but I want to leave out her side of things just in-case this thread gets discovered. The bride is too high maintenance for me bordering bridezilla , this is one incident of a few that have got me thinking about the kind of person she really is and I can't stand her anymore. I have been doing hours and hours worth of unpaid graphic design work for her and her wedding to save her money, she says thanks, but I really feel like I'm being taken for granted after last night. I don't want to cause her even more stress though.
Am I wrong here? This is one of so many problems that she has with me and other people. I get along fine with everyone but I, along with a few other close friends are constantly winging about how she can be, does she need to be told or am I just wasting my time? I just feel like it’s not that big of a deal but because this is one of many things in the past it’s all proving too much to be friends with her anymore.

I hope this all made sense.



TL:DR: I upset the bride by briefly leaving hens night by visiting another friends birthday party.

13555,Non-Romantic,1tzs00,"My sister and I had an abusive and disgruntled father for our early childhood years. She had a more serious reaction to his abuse, while I was more of a favourite child and found him to be supportive. While his behaviour had some bad effects on me, I believe they are mostly gone, and I am more than willing to spill my emotions out to others to combat any negative thoughts/feelings.

My sister, however, has a thick shell. She told me tonight that she has nervous breakdowns, and is taking medications to help cope. She has not shared this with our immediate family; her relationship with my mother is fragile and volatile so I understand why. However, I am deeply concerned for her. I feel that she will inherit the traits of my father and that she will continue the cycle of abuse. She is not working hard to better her mental and emotional situation.

For a little bit of context, here is a short story. When we were 15 and 17 respectively, we fought bloody verbal and physical battles. When she was cornered or wounded, she would say things like you have problems, and you need help. She used those accusations of mental ill-health very frequently! She's 21 now, and we got into a slight verbal scuffle, and she said those same words. I am convinced that she has not grown through her mental/emotional hardships and has simply repressed them further.

She will be moving to a big &amp; expensive city for school that she won't survive in. She has no friends and family there, and (I believe) she will deteriorate further into her own mind. I feel she will ruin her already bad financial situation, as well as her own sense of self-worth.

What is a brother to do? I see it happening, but I feel helpless. I am willing to let her life run it's course and stay out of it, but if there is a set of decisive and smart actions to steer her mental health in the right direction, I am all ears.

13564,Non-Romantic,2vpehk,"My husband and I eloped last year, but I've known his brother Bill for about four years. He's generally a nice guy, and because my husband and him are quite close, I find myself biting my tongue a lot.

Here are some examples that bother me:

First things first. I don't know what happened, but since his girlfriend has been saying my name wrong, Bill has been pronouncing my name wrong. He must hear my name at least three times a week, once in a blue moon it's pronounced correctly, but he keeps forgetting the last syllable. I'm used to being very upfront with my friends and family, I just don't want to offend him, but Jesus, it's truly not difficult.

Secondly it has become an annoyance with how he is treating our dogs when he comes over. We have repeatedly asked him to not give the dogs human food, as I have trained them to sit in their beds while we have our dinner. Bill will continually tease the dog by waving food from where he's sitting, even after I have told him twice to stop. Dogs can't be trained' is his retort. It happens every time he comes over. I offer him food, which he uses to tease and give to the dog. I hate it.

I find some of his basic mannerisms to be rude at times. He dumps off all his laundry at our house once a week to do, taking out our finished wet clothes and leaving them in the bin. If we offer him food, he will look at it and crinkle his nose, telling us it looks gross. If he has dinner with us and doesnt like it, he will say It was just okay, after we ask him how it was out of politeness. If we offer to buy pizza for dinner he will say yeah, give me money, without offering to pitch in. He eats his dinner with his mouth wide open, talking while eating and flicking crumbs out of his beard.

I think he's old enough to act like an adult. If not for me, for his own sake. How can I be upfront without being too rude?

13568,Non-Romantic,1se15v,"Hello, /r/relationships! I need advice on how to talk to my grandmother, or how my parents can talk to her about her driving situation.

My grandmother is 81 years old and still driving, although the whole family doesn't think she should be. Her vision is poor, even with her glasses, and she's beginning to forget basic driving skills.

She recently told me she wanted to get a new car because her car's steering wheel was too bulky. I could sort-of understand that logic as she's a very tiny frail woman. She told me it was too hard for her to see over the wheel to see which was her turn signal post and which was her windshield wipers, and often in the rain she would hit the wrong one. That was a huge red flag to me since it should be rote memory from driving.

Now onto her driving itself. My father went with her to get gas in her car(it's something they do every Sunday, tradition I guess?) today and when my dad got back he said he was lucky to make it home. To get to the gas station she uses, she has to make a U-turn, and apparently hit the curb on the other side of the road with her tire so hard it jostled my father in his seat. He said she didn't say anything about it and acted as if nothing happened. When they were leaving, my grandmother hardly looked for traffic, and pulled out of the gas station into the middle lane to eventually drift into the right hand lane. I've gone to get gas with her before and she always goes directly into the right lane. My father said she didn't even realize she made such a wide turn and was really aiming for the right lane.

I wash my grandmother's car from time to time. Every single rim has some sort of damage/scrape to it. On the passenger(right side here in America) side the rear rim has curb rash around the entire face and edge of the rim. The front passenger rim is about 1/2 scraped and a slice of tire is hanging off, about the size of my thumb nail. Nothing to drain air, just took a gash out of the tire. There's also evidence of her rubbing her front end over parking bumpers(happens to everyone at least once) and also what appears to be her backing into a trash can/shopping cart. No paint transfer, so I'm fairly certain, or at least hope, she didn't back up into any vehicles.

The only driving she does is to go to the grocery store 1/2 a mile away from her house, go to her prayer group at church about 2 miles from her house, and get gas down the street. She takes back roads to get to church but has to go on a populated highway(not interstate or anything) to get gas and groceries.

How should my family talk to her about this? She's a very stubborn woman and would be offended if we don't discuss it properly. We just fear that she will get into a fatal car accident, hit someone or their vehicle in a parking lot, or not see a child playing in the street. It's got us fairly concerned and we need a concise way to convince her she needs to stay off the road.

My mother(it's her mother) has offered to take her to get groceries but my grandmother declines saying it's fine and she can do it herself. Someone in my family could always take her to get groceries but her prayer meeting would be more difficult as it's around 6am on a Tuesday, IIRC. It's a group of other elderly ladies that get together to talk, pray, etc., so maybe we could suggest one of them drive her? 

Thanks in advance for any help/advice you guys and gals can provide!

However, we are very open with each other. We are good friends as well as siblings.

We were doing something recently and she commented about how the female character shouldn't have returned to the person who cheated on her, so I brought up her cheating incident. That is when she revealed to me that she would not have met her current boyfriend (who she is *very* happy with and I think is great as well) had she not cheated on her old one. This was her counter-argument.

Again, she did *not* cheat on her old boyfriend with the new one. I'm not sure how her actions led to them meeting.

My counter argument was that no matter what then, she had to come to peace with the fact that she did something that *she herself* hated to be happy now.

13613,Non-Romantic,2ystv3,"So here is the situation. My boyfriend and I live together and we have a roommate who is also our friend who moved in with us recently. The bf and I are pretty conscious about our eating habits and picky about our groceries. We like to know where our meat and produce come from, and we usually prefer to shop locally.  We buy our meat from a butcher that we’ve known for years, our bread from a local bakery, etc. You get the picture. We also love cooking and we don’t mind cooking every day for our roommate if he decides to split the groceries cost. We have done this with previous roommates and they loved it, and even said they felt healthier, lost weight, and saved money. When our friend  moved in, we told him that he has the option to shop/eat separately, or share with us. He decided that he will try it for a week and see if he likes it this way or not. Our weekly grocery bill is usually around $50 per person so it’s not that bad. So we tried it for a week, and he said that he really liked it this way and kept saying how much he is excited to live with people who could cook delicious food. The problem is, he went last night to a chain grocery store and spent $150 on food that we don’t usually buy and we won’t really eat, and this is the second time this happened. I really know that he means very well, and he probably thinks that we will take turns in buying groceries and splitting them, so he is trying to be helpful. But we don’t want it this way. We don’t mind doing the grocery shopping every week ourselves, and we usually ask him if he has any special requests or cravings. We are not sure how to express this to him without hurting his feelings, and without sounding like snobby asswholes!!
We plan to pay for the groceries he bought this time even though we don’t want them, but we don’t want this to keep happening again and again, because it’s also a waste of money, and it took us a while to figure out a good budget for our weekly groceries.

13621,Non-Romantic,2s74g8,"Little backstory: I've known my SO for 10 years. We went to college together and had the same friend group. He met his best friend at the same college and they lived together at school and well after school ended. They also lived together for a few years in Colorado until my SO moved back to our home state.

So here's the issue...I'd never formally met this guy, but I'd heard a ton about him and he seemed like a good guy to know. SO and I fly out to Colorado for my SO's friend's wedding about 2 months ago. SO is super happy and excited that I'm going to meet several of his best friends that he worked and lived with during his time in Colorado, especially this guy. 

No sooner than we landed SO gets a troubling text message from this guy. We're standing in 20 degree weather waiting on our shuttle outside of the airport and this dude texts him and says that he HAS colon cancer. SO is super fucking upset, like going into all these scenarios of losing his friends and getting really emotional. The ride to the hotel was terrible. The whole time his friend is telling SO through text message not to say anything to anyone because he doesn't want the weekend to be overshadowed by this. SO agrees.

The next day we meet this guy and a few other people for brunch. No one seems to know (and these are supposed to be his best friends) and he is acting like nothing at all is wrong. SO and I think he's just putting on a brave face and we're pretty proud of him for seemingly handling this so well. We invite him to hang out with us and get ready with us at our hotel for the wedding that is taking place that night. He declines saying he'd like to get some rest. Cool.

We get to the wedding reception and this dude is at the bar just slamming beers. SO is super concerned about his well-being and this dude is just all Let's get crazy, bro!. They only talk about Memory Lane stuff, try to include me because we all went to the same college, we generally have a pleasant time. About an hour before the reception ends this guy asks SO if he can speak with him privately. I'm cool hanging out alone so they head off outside in single-digit weather. This guy is telling SO that he will know the prognosis the following week. He tells SO that he'll just kill himself if it's stage 4 and all sorts of shit. Just really giving my SO the Full Monty of emotions. They are out there the entire last hour of the reception and only left because our cab was there waiting.

Fast forward to the next week. This guy tells SO that he cancels the appointment to find out about his cancer that he says he already has. He says it's rescheduled for the next week. My SO keeps calling him, worried fucking sick, and appointments just keep getting moved. He constantly changes the subject. He then says he hasn't been to his regular doctor, but he went straight to a Urologist because he wasn't feeling well...I didn't know you could do that... Anyway, nothing is adding up with this guy. It's been since the beginning of November and he just keeps telling SO that he's had to reschedule all these appointments. The last message, and the one that makes me really believe it's a lie, is his response of ? when SO asked him if he'd heard anything yet. It's like he forgot he's already told him that he HAS CANCER. 

Here's my question... How do I help my SO recover from this? He's pretty much resigned to the idea that this dude is lying. I mean, unless this guy has cancer, doesn't want to fight it and is just living his life without letting anyone in on it then he has given my SO a total fucking mindfuck. I'd really prefer not to have this guy as part of his/our life moving forward, but I'd really like to not have to make that call.

13630,Non-Romantic,2ck60i,"Hey r/relationships, this is my first post here because I could really use some outside advice. Here's the story

Me and my SO have been dating about 9 months, we were very close for about 6 months before dating and knew each other for about a year and a half before that. Things are good in our relationship, we're very happy together and just recently moved in together with another couple friend, and that's mainly where this all started. 

Up until a week ago we both lived with our parents, but I am starting law school in the fall and had been planning on moving for about a year. Six months ago I asked my SO to move with me and he agreed. As my graduation got closer I told him as soon as we are both out of school for the summer we need to start apartment searching because I only have until August before I start school. He finally told his mom that he was moving out and she took it badly and kicked him out. 

She has a variety of reasons for nbot liking it, at first it was the fact that we could not possibly find an apartment in our price range that would be suitable to live in or in a good area. Next it was that he shouldn't be moving out with me until he married me, more or less. Then it was that our relationship was not good, that he's just co dependent, we don't have a normal relationship because we like spending all of are time together. Honestly a lot more was said about me and our relationship but I can't recall in detail and I'm sure there is still plenty I don't know. Then she tells him he's a disgrace to her reputation (because an almost 23 year old man is moving out of his mothers house with his girlfriend, gasp!). She even went as far as saying he should essentially fake move in with me by just spending all his time there but actually living with her. 

The bottom line to me is about control. She has had to control every aspect of his life. There are many examples I could put but I'll just state a few to get the point across. She only allows him to have one person over once a week otherwise feels its too invasive, she wouldn't allow him to leave the house unless it was for some reason she wanted or if he was going to work, she constantly made him feel guilty for being gone three nights out of the week because he was at work, anytime he would do something she didn't approve of like be gone for work or hang out with me she would tell him how much of a burden he was, eating her food, using her electricity blah blah blah

So he's kicked out, goes to live with his dad and only a few days later is told he needs to get his stuff. We go to her house and found is room has been totally changed, his stuff thrown randomly into boxes, furniture in different places, basically just making things as difficult as possible for him. He's told he's not allowed to take his bed, which he had bought (not that we wanted it), that he couldn't take his night stand, his brother got his desk and he was given his brothers old crappy desk that fell apart, he was told he could his dresser but then on moving day changed her mind and said she didn't want to break up the set it was in, so he had no place to put his clothes and it was another expense for us. 

She also pulls other crap that is more of a slight to me. I've always been invvited to family gatherings and I get along with his family quite well. So it's hi nephews birthday and my SO is invited but no mention if I am, although it wouldn't have been a question in the past. He asks his aunt, gets no response until his mom calls and says that she does not want me there. I was pissed. Its one thing to not invite me to something involving just him and her but it is a family gathering that I have always been invited to in the past. After he hangs up with his mom his aunt texts him and says that he can choose whether to bring me or not, she doesn't have a problem with me and her mom may be mad at her for it but they can have their disagreements. I went to the party, his mom said hi to me, nothing else was said and it was very awkward for me but I'm glad he got to see everyone.

No we're moved in, my mom and brother have seen the apartment, my bestfriends mom and boyfriend has been, her fiancee's family has seen it, and also my SO's dad and brother, but not his mom. He invited her to come over tomorrow but she declined.

This is my bottom line: She is allowed to have her own opinion but she should still be supportive of her son. My family allowed me to take all of my things and helped in getting new thing or donating old stuff, and so did my bestfriend's family and her fiancee's family. They have all seen our house, they have all been involved and supportive but she has not. She refuse to come over tomorrow but invites him to her house instead so clearly she can spare the time. I think this is about control. She only speaks to him when he texts her and then makes him feel guilty for not talking to her or seeing her yet makes absolutely no effort to see or talk to him. She wants him to come to her tomorrow so she can exert what control she has left. I think she is just being selfish and controlling, she should be supportive and want to be involved and interested in her sons life. It's not like he moved to a crack house with someone he barely knows, and even if he was, he is an adult who should make his own decisions.

He wants to have a relationship with her, and I want that too. I feel awkward around her because she does not approve of me or our relationship and I'm quite angry at her for treating her son so poorly, but I have no problem putting that aside if she wants to have a good relationship with her son. 

So what do I do? She clearly only wants things on her terms, and doesn't approve or anything. I want him to have a relationship with her, but an actually healthy one where she is not in total control. He just says he doesn't want to say anything because he doesn't want to cause conflict, but I also no he feels bad that things aren't well between them. I realize this may not be a huge deal, but its something that is causing issues and I'd like some outside advice.

13633,Non-Romantic,25pbnx,"My best friend Mike and I live with our roommate, Kate, and have since August of last year. She is making both of us crazy to the point where we both hide in our bedrooms when we are home most of the time.

Neither of us knew Kate that well when we moved in with her but had been friends with her for 2-3 years. As we found out after moving in with her, she is kind of known at our school for being crazy and flying off the handle regularly -- which we now see at home regularly. She has never flipped out at either of us, really, but has gotten into insane obsessive fights that last months over absolutely nothing. She also lies a lot about those fights or will omit details to make herself look better. 

She had told me specifically when she moved in that she had a personality disorder and was in therapy for it and had been (and had been stable) for a long time. This made sense. She stopped going to therapy 3-4 months ago and has since denied having this mental health issue, which freaks me out. 

At home, she pretty much never leaves. Don't get me wrong, she has friends. But she goes out (without me/us) MAYBE once a month and spends the rest of the time in her room watching netflix (if Mike and I are busy) or follows me/us around the apartment talking non-stop until one of us either tells her to stop or we go in our rooms. It's overwhelming and makes both of us exhausted and uncomfortable at home. I can't tell you the last time I was home and had a moment to myself, let alone one outside my own bedroom while she was also home. 

She has also not cleaned in several months. She cleaned once over the winter holidays (without being asked, which is nice but wasn't necessary) and now brings it up whenever the topic of cleaning comes up. In the past two months, Kate has literally cleaned nothing. She leaves piles of dishes (stacked up from being left in her room for days) in the sink for days until someone else washes them. She hasn't cleaned any dishes otherwise, not even taken them out of the dishwasher. 

She leaves food til it rots in the fridge. She has been known to leave huge cooking messes on the countertops and has stained our cabinets with wine from just being messy and not cleaning. She will even leave trash on the floor (or make her own trash bag on the floor and just leave it there for a substantial period of time) and just never pick it up. 

We had agreed that everyone would clean yesterday and this morning (for months, we said this) because the three of us are graduating this weekend and everyone's parents are in town. She did nothing and apparently left an hour ago to go to the gym and drive to her parent's house (which she is staying at until Saturday night). Yesterday she actively hid in her room watching netflix literally all day while I cleaned my share of our apartment and only left the room when she heard my door close. 

We have talked to her repeatedly about cleaning and she will either promise to do it (and never does) or will start yelling about how Mike and I never clean the communal bathroom (not true) or something similar. 

Our landlord lives upstairs and has commented on the state of parts of our apartment when he has come in to fix things. On top of that, she smokes weed 2-5 times a day (sometimes more) and does so in the apartment at all hours of the day despite the fact he warned us he would call the cops if she keeps doing it. Yesterday I asked her to not smoke in the house because Mike's parents were stopping by. She started smoking in her bedroom (instead of her usual spot) which is right by the front door. You could smell it in the entire apartment and hallways of our building. It was embarrassing when Mike's folks got here and I'm getting worried about what our landlord might do if he smells it again. 

I can't move out until July at the earliest, and Mike is going to be gone most of the summer. Help?

13660,Non-Romantic,3267hp,"Hey guys, I need serious help with an issue that has been going on, on a serious level, for about 8 years. 



Friend (let's call her Lily for arguments sake) and I have been friends since were maybe 12 years old. We've gone through school and college together and share a best friend (let's name her Rosie). I have known Rosie since birth and she is my best friend in the whole wide world. We have had our issues too (and there was a period where she really wasn't nice to me at all) but have worked through them with space, time and patience. I would consider my friendship with Rosie now to be healthy. 



The three of us became really tight around the age of 14. We live in a really small town, which really doesn't help my situation at all, and my high school memories of our time together were Lily and Rosie using me as their DUFF (designated, ugly, fat friend). They were very petite girls with classic good looks. I grew into my curves a lot earlier than them, am naturally quite stocky, broad shouldered, hour-glass/pear shaped figure etc. I also think I emotionally matured a lot quicker than them too so was always labelled the sensible one or not fun. Going shopping with them was a nightmare and I have felt very anxious about shopping for clothes ever since. (I have recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and sometimes clothes shopping triggers me.) This would probably be due to around the age of 15/16/17 when we first started going on outings together, we would go to a clothes shop and Lily and Rosie would pick up large items of clothing and throw them at me and say things like here, this will fit you. Rosie also once laughed at me in a fitting room because of the way something looked on me. Being naturally stocky in figure, some things don't look right on me/I don't feel comfortable wearing and this sort of reaction from them both was not uncommon throughout our teenage years. In fact it was very common. I was always the butt of the jokes, always being put down to make themselves feel better, they never had to worry about me being competition because they knew I wasn't as (classically) pretty as them. 


We didn't really have anything in common. I was the dorky, quirky, nerd with the (put on) loud personality to make myself stand out next to these two poster girls. Even my Mum (who I love, and I know she didn't mean this maliciously) would gush over how pretty Lily and Rosie were and how smart they both were and were smarter than me and that just made me feel inadequate at home and at school. 



I know what I should have done was to walk away and I would have advised anyone else to do the same thing. But around the same time I suffered a personal tragedy. My Dad had been ill throughout his life and his health started to deteriorate rapidly when I was around 13. He passed away when I was 15 leaving my mother and I to pick up the pieces. I had a wonderful, idyllic childhood, very, very lucky, certainly a healthier home life than Lily and Rosie, and losing my father was not only a tragedy to me but to the community as well. He was very well loved. So I'm sure naturally clung onto what was stable. My 'friends'. So Lily and Rosie became those people who you just grow up with and are friends with but if you could have your time again you probably wouldn't pick them friends. 



We all had our first boyfriend's around the same time. Everything was a competition. Who was going to have sex first, and if you had been with your boyfriend the longest then it was the real deal. I was constantly looked down upon by Lily because her and her boyfriend had been together for a long time. My boyfriend at the time (my first serious boyfriend, let's call him Ben) was quite fun, cheeky, liked to have a laugh and they both hated him. With a passion. It seemed that the boyfriends I did have, all 2 of them whilst we were all living in the same area, were hated upon. I still to this day have no idea why. They weren't happy for me because I had found someone I loved. Ben and I had our difficulties and he wasn't perfect but neither was I. Ben and I are still really good friends to this day and both of us still can't understand what Lily (and Rosie's) problem was. 



So everything between the three of us and our boyfriends was competitive. Lily had lost her virginity before Rosie and I and so gloated at every given opportunity about how sexually experienced she was and how her and her boyfriend were SO in LOVE. She frequently gloated at social gatherings about how dirty she was in bed and exaggerated her anecdotes to the point of extremity. (I can recount every single version of a particular story I've heard it so many times and exaggerated to different points.) Whenever we had social gatherings it was always THE LILY SHOW, she was the ring leader saying jump and Rosie was saying 'how high?'. 



So I managed to escape this toxic friendship and go off to uni, I found my niche - creative writing (something I could finally call my own) - and unfortunately was sucked in once again into a toxic, manipulative, abusive friendship. (But that's a whole other story on a whole different level.)



When I came back from university, I had a mental breakdown. Finally all of the shit Rosie and Lily put me through, my father's death, my abusive friendship at university, my insecurities, everything just toppled over me. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and severe depression. I've been nine months in recovery and I've been making slow progress but progress none the less. I have a great doctor, a wonderfully supportive family and am lucky to be living at home where my mum is my main carer and is one of the most inspirational people on the planet, and so devoted to helping me recover. I think I was always going to have a breakdown because of losing my father, and I think I've had anxiety since I was a child (and genetic I think), but I feel as though my negative self talk was so much worse because of how I was treated. All I've ever done is be nice to people, and treat others as I wish to be treated, with kindness and empathy, and they threw it back in my face again and again. 



Rosie and Lily still see each other. I don't know how often over the past few years whilst I have been away but since all three of us have come back to the area in which we've grown up, I've been having to see Lily because Rosie invites her to our gatherings. Lily has no other friends beside Rosie. Whilst I've been away Rosie also went away to university and Lily spent her time working, then she broke up with her 'oh so special boyfriend' slept with his best friend just hours later who is now her baby daddy. He's financially well off and I just can't help thinking that this is all part of her game plan. She currently doesn't work. 



So I'm currently working through the issues I'm going through (not in therapy yet but will be, am on medication though) and Lily seems to show up at every corner with the same attitude, the same conversations that we used to have YEARS ago, telling the same stories and I just can't help but get catapulted back into being a teenager, feeling insecure etc. She hasn't emotionally matured in the time at all and she's due to be a mum like next month. She hasn't changed at all, and I can just feel all of the emotions, the frustration, the negative self talk, being the butt of the jokes, all of it just coming back again and it's not that I can't deal with it, I just don't want to anymore. 



As I say, she's not good for my mental health or my recovery as I'm not very strong at the moment. I really want to cut her out but she told me I was going to be her bridesmaid (which might never happen, who knows) and she keeps showing up at social gatherings because Rosie invites her. I don't want to cut ties with Rosie because we've actually become really strong friends and she has changed and emotionally matured so much since then. She has been aiding my recovery unlike Lily. How do I cut someone out that is so insistent on being around? I find it very awkward to say no, talk about negative feelings and I wouldn't be comfortable sitting down and talking it out with her which I know is probably the solution. She hasn't really done like one thing to me, she's just not a nice person that I don't want to be around but I feel powerless. I don't want to cause a fuss, I just want to back away quietly and fade into the background and hopefully just phase her out.

13661,Non-Romantic,3akwew,"I've been best friends with (lets call her) Abby ever since the beginning of elementary school. She's always been self-conscious and demeaning of her body, and has very low confidence in herself. I've done my best to tell her that it's not true, but there seems to be only so much I can do as she needs to realize it herself. 

Almost two years ago, she got into a relationship with her current boyfriend [20/m]. At first it was good. She became more confident in herself and she seemed very happy. I didn't know him very well, but he can be rude sometimes which I didn't like. He doesn't know how to filter his mouth, but because Abby was so happy and becoming more confident in herself, I told her as long as he wasn't mean to her, then I would support their relationship happily.

However, there have been signs of him being very controlling and downright rude. About a year ago, I went on a double date with her. She told me how she was wearing a certain outfit that he told her he wanted to wear. I felt uncomfortable that her bf would tell her what type of clothes to wear, but she reassured me saying that he was just helping her confidence and that she was happy he saw her attractive in those clothes. I brushed it off. Then on that date, he left in the middle of it to go visit his mother. I was flabbergasted. At least he should have taken her with him, but she was left behind with me and my bf at the time. I was furious, and told her that she shouldn't take that kind of shit from someone. She was angry too, and told me she was going to have a long talk with him. When he got back though, not even five minutes later, she forgave him. This was one of the many incidents that has happened that sent red flags to my mind.

However, now-a-days, when I tell her that she deserves better and that he's becoming too controlling, she gets really defensive and basically shuts me out, changing topics. Not too long ago, I had Abby and another friend spend the night with me for my birthday. It was going to be a chill girl's night, and we all went out to get food. When we came back to my place, my mom tells us that her bf had stopped by asking for her, but left since we weren't home. Apparently he just wanted to talk with her and hang out with her, BUT WHO GOES OVER TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE LIKE THAT?! He knew it was a girl's night, but decided to come over anyway. Another time she was out with me, and we were blasting music in my car and we were going to spend the night at a friend's house. Abby wasn't paying attention to her phone in her purse, and an hour later, she has 10 missed calls from her bf and 9 missed calls from her mom. Abby calls her bf to see what was going on, and he starts lecturing her about how she needs to answer her phone like he's her father and that he called her mother to check in where she was. Since her mom didn't know that she was going to spend the night at a friend's house with me, her mom became worried. It was an hour max that she didn't check her phone, and I understand her mother being worried (her brother knew where she was going but her parents were elsewhere), but I did not like the fact that her bf has called her mother JUST because she didn't text back right away. I even told him that it was uncalled for to lecture her about texting back, that people aren't always on their phones. He told me to shut the fuck up, which really pissed me off. Abby, of course, let him stomp over her like a rug.

I love her so much, and I don't want to see her be stuck with such a controlling and mean bf, but everything I say or do will not get through to her. She's so in love with him and thankful that he made her confident, but all he's really done was make her super dependent on him. And he's super dependent on her in a way as he has no life outside of their relationship. 

I don't know what to do to help her. Maybe I'm approaching it wrong? I'm not mad at her when she gets super defensive when I tell her he's not good for her and call out all the red flags, because I know she really is just afraid of never finding someone again, but he really needs to leave her life. She needs to stop taking his shit.

13671,Non-Romantic,2bobwa,"Lately I've been feeling a bit lonely. I have a lot of acquaintances and a large circle of casual friends, but very few close ones. My few close friends all live in different cities and while I do chat to them a lot, it's all online. My friends in this city feel so distant. I hardly ever see them, I never know what's going on in their lives. I'm pretty good at making acquaintances, the level where I get invited to parties, but I want more.

I'm sure the problem is me, I don't know how to reach a deeper level where they would call me up if something happened or just to chat. A way I used to get closer to friends in college was to share personal stories (funny dating disasters, horrible roommates etc) but now my life is incredibly settled. I live with my lovely long term boyfriend, we get on really well and never argue and it's all very harmonious. When friends ask how things are, I don't really have anything to say. Things are good, no news, nothing to report. I feel too awkward to share personal things from my relationship. I hate those girls who plaster Facebook with shit about their boyfriend being wonderful every time they so much as wash a cup. I'm afraid of being the smug married person. A lot of the people I know are single or have serious issues in their relationship, I don't want want them to feel like I disapprove or judge them or whatever. That could all just be in my head.

13680,Non-Romantic,1psv9j,"Phillip (not his real name) and I met about 2 and a half years ago when I started dating his best friend. The 3 of us quickly became great friends and would hang out all the time (occasionally another mutual friend would hang out too).   
  
It wasn't an awkward third wheel situation 95% of the time, just friends hanging out. Phillip, my then-boyfriend, and the other friend were always pretty big nerds. Video games, Magic, D&amp;D, Pokemon, extremely introverted, that type. But they are all amazing guys.   
  
Phillip and I hit it off, platonically I thought. I knew he found me attractive, but I chalked it up to being a relatively pretty girl around guys who weren't around women like at all. It wasn't weird for me at the time.  
  
Fast forward 2 years and my boyfriend and I break up. Phillip was super worried that I was going to stop being his friend, hanging out with them, and that it was his fault for always being around. I assured him none of that was the case.... But our conversations turned in a direction I really didn't enjoy. I was pretty upset about the break-up, and would complain about my ex to him. Mostly just I don't understand why he doesn't like me anymore. Why can't he just have normal emotions? Why is he such a bad person/friend. (I do not feel this way now, it was just my broke heart talking.) Phillip would always take it further, telling me how much of an asshole he was and how he didn't deserve me, and that I deserved someone who would recognize how amazing I am, etc.   
  
He got a motorcycle soon after my breakup. Half of his reason was to impress women. We were joking about it sometime soon after, and he said, You don't have to answer, but would you ever ride it? I told him honestly that I wouldn't because it would make me uncomfortable. He responded with, What if /ex-boyfriend/ wasn't in the picture? Would you then? I told him that he was in the picture and that I couldn't just erase him. On more than one occasion he asked if I found him attractive, or if /ex-boyfriend/ wasn't in the picture, if I would have dated him. These questions made me increasingly uncomfortable until I confronted him (granted, over Facebook) and told him that I didn't like the way he was bad mouthing my ex (his best friend) and that I was uncomfortable with the way he was speaking with me. He got *extremely* upset and logged off to cry. I saw him the next day after a 5k race I ran, and he just collapsed into my arms, sobbing about not wanting to lose me or my friendship and feeling like an asshole.  
  
I told him that I was still going to be his friend, but he had to stop talking about /ex/ that way to me. So, he did. However, he has continued asking me questions about whether or not he is attractive, and why girls won't date him, and how lonely he is, how sad he is...But every time I give him any advice, he combats it with a negative. I understand self-deprecating humor but this is not that. Every single one of our conversations ends up me needing to reassure him that someone is out there for him, or needing to awkwardly laugh when he talks about how amazing/sexy I am, etc.   
  
I got into an argument with hi the other night because some of our other friends and I decided to play an RPG game. My ex told me that Phillip couldn't play, so I took that as the truth and organized a weekly night for us to all get together. Apparently Phillip hadn't expressly told my ex that he couldn't play, just that he wasn't sure. But Phillip got very upset with me for not checking with him personally to make sure that he couldn't play. I found the entire thing to be really immature and a cry for attention from me. He kept complaining about us ignoring him, and making up excuses about why we wouldn't even be able to play. I finally laid into him that I wasn't going to entertain any more of that conversation and that he was being childish and I was logging off.   
  
The next day, we went to the same small party and he looked like a 5 year old whose puppy was just shot. He looked at me with sad eyes all night, even though I was being nice. And then this morning, he tells me that he was surprised he had fun at the party because he was sure I was going to yell at him there, and that he had hit rock bottom that day. He then told me that he had something really serious to tell me, and that I couldn't tell anyone. And that I wasn't going to like it. I told him that I wasn't ready to hear something like that because I felt justified in being angry with him and that we needed to change some things about our friendship...and I didn't want him to intentionally manipulate me to make me feel badly for him...  
  
So I told him we would meet sometime this week to talk. I'm afraid he is going to tell me that he contemplated suicide or something of that nature. He said that if I thought we needed to work on our friendship he guessed he will..... But this whole thing just makes me 100% sure that I can't handle this friendship the way it is... I can't be the sole reason for someone's happiness. He's too dependent on me.. I can't keep myself out of depression, I certainly cannot handle someone else's.   
  
I'm sorry for this rambling. I just don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Is this a toxic friendship that I should end forever? Am I actually being a disgusting friend? If this friendship implodes, everything will be awkward. We all hang out, my ex and I are FWB (which Phillip doesn't approve of...residual feelings maybe?) so I'm not willing to stop being friends with the rest of our group. And I do love Phillip, I just can't handle this kind of pressure. Any advice at all would be really appreciated.

13688,Non-Romantic,2ijign,"My friend (24 f) is doing a 6 week placement in my (25 f) workplace (a laboratory) as part of her med school programme. Just as an example, let's say that she's interested in becoming a neurologist and I work in a neuroscience lab. We both did our undergrad degrees together and were really good friends, and when we graduated she went into med school and I did a PhD. My friend applied for this placement knowing that it was where I work and knowing that there was a good chance that I would be her day to day supervisor (her official supervisor is my boss, the head of the lab, but it is my responsibility to manage her project on a daily basis and show her how to do things. I do this with other students all the time and have never had issues before).


I had some reservations about having to supervise an old friend but thought it might be fun. I was wrong. This friend has always been a little high strung and has a tendency to be a bit of a know it all, but I was always able to deal with that before. But now that she is in my workplace I am finding her statue incredibly frustrating.


She clearly doesn't enjoy being shown what to do by someone who used to be her peer, and she is overconfident. Usually I have to show students how to do difficult procedures a couple of times before they can do it on their own. After the first time, she insists that she can do things, tells me she doesn't need help, and then does them wrong. She has been making mistakes with a method because she rushes it and doesn't refer back to the instructions I typed out for her often enough. I pointed out the mistakes and suggest that she missed a step on the protocol by trying to get through it quickly, and she said that maybe I just taught her the wrong way to do it. She won't accept blame for anything. When my other students use my protocols their experiments work perfectly, but when hers go wrong she says there must be something wrong with the chemicals I gave her, etc. 


She is not familiar with a lot of things we do in my lab and how they work, so it is my job to explain how they work to her. When I do this she will interrupt, try to correct my pronunciation or use of technical terms (usually wrongly), and whenever I do finish explaining something research related to her she will bring up something medical or surgery related that she thinks I won't have heard of, point out that I won't know anything about it because I am not a medical doctor, and then explain it to me. Which is unnecessary and wastes time, because we're in a research lab - I'm not in her hospital trying to make out like I can perform surgery. 

She has only been in my lab for a week and it is already exhausting. I don't know how to bring up her attitude in a way that won't make it worse for the next 5 weeks!

Length of our relationship has been life.
I will try and keep this short. My husband and I hit rock bottom and have 0 money to live on till he gets paid on the third. As in we only have the gas in our tanks and have no money to fill the vehicle back up till he gets paid again. 

 We have had a few financial set backs that I don't really care to go into. These set backs have been so severe that we have eaten through our emergency fund. 
My brother owes me 175.00. Via email he agreed to pay me back by the 15th of this month. He didn't, and I reminded him about it a week ago. He said, he forgot. I called him yesterday and told him we only had a 100 bucks left till the third. (we ate through that last night because my oldest had a glass door break on her hand and she needed to be seen and get stitches so we had the co-pay to pay on the spot, they don't let you not pay it, you can't say send me a bill. I tried.) My brother got angry with me and said he only had 260 bucks left until the third too and he guesses he will just have to go broke to pay me back. 

I don't know what else to do to get the money he owes me. We need it, like now. He thinks i'm being a bitch and am making him go broke. He is a family of 1. We are a family of 7 and need at least half of what he owes us so we can survive the next week and a half. 
He is a redditor and I am on my main account. 
I hope he reads this because if I call him and try to talk to him he will just hang up on me and get real pissy with me. I can't deal with that right now because I have too many other things going on.

13710,Non-Romantic,376g9m,"My friend Carl and I have known each other for a long time, since 5th grade. We dated for less than a year as seniors in high school and had a pretty good relationship. He was really there for me when I needed it and his parents let me stay in their spare room overnight after the tension between my mom and I came to a physical head. We also had some similar interests and were both into hypnosis. We would sometimes hypnotize each other and do fun hypnosis experiments, sometimes crossing into hypnosis fetish. About a month into my semester at an out-of-state college, he broke up with me. We both moved on, dated other people, etc. It's pretty normal for me to keep ex-boyfriends as just regular friends after 3-6 months of no-contact, so it wasn't abnormal for me to start hanging out with him again after coming home from my first year of college for summer.

Our houses are literally a block away, and because neither of us were able to find work, I spent a lot of my time hanging out with him. I saw him almost every day and since I was collecting a harem that summer, we would make out and act kind of coupley with the knowledge that we were not in a relationship.

That summer he also came clean to me about a lot of things he had lied to me about. Some of them were little stupid things, like just about people he was friends with but that I didn't really know. When asked, he told me that he lied about things just because he could. Looking back, when we were in 5th grade he would tell me things that were very obviously lies, like that he had won the lottery but because he wasn't old enough to collect his winnings, his parents had it in a savings account that he couldn't touch until he was 18. But because I was 11 and gullible, I believed him at the time and he never corrected the lie. 

Perhaps more disturbing is that he also admitted to me that he had tried some fucked up things on me with hypnosis, then had me forget about them. Stuff like a verbal command to have me behave like a slave girl. But because he very clearly has this past problem with lying (and because I have no way to verify that he has legitimately decided to stop lying), I'm not sure whether or not to believe even this story.

I'm also fairly certain that he is either still lying to me or has some high-functioning version of schizophrenia. According to him, he has a demon in his mind that talks to him, thinks that he will one day rule or destroy the world, and is often very paranoid. Like jumpy always looking over your shoulder kind of paranoid. But his symptoms don't interfere enough with his daily life that he would require medication, hospitalization, or even really treatment in general, which somewhat leads me to believe that he's just paranoid and is lying about the other stuff. 

Since that summer between freshman and sophomore year, I haven't seen him as much since I haven't been home for more than a week at a time. I only visit twice a year for Christmas and summer, and since he's always out of town for Christmas, I only see him typically once during the summer. I just finished my fifth year at school (graduated, woohoo), so that summer was four years ago, so I've only seen him once a year for the last four years. I'm currently unsure whether I want to remain friends with him and whether I want to put forth my effort and (precious little) time in town to hang out with him. It's often pretty difficult to meet up with him, and I often feel like I'm putting forth most of the effort. But when he occasionally messages me out of the blue (not often, a handful of times a year), he always ends the conversation asking me to let him know when I'll be in town next. I also miss him sometimes as he's been a close friend of mine for awhile, and sometimes just go on facebook to try and find out more about him and get disappointed when there's nothing new from when I last checked. He's almost never on facebook and the last thing he posted was in December. I'm not sure whether I can trust him or whether the friendship is really worth the small amount that I'm getting, but at the same time, I still want to be involved in his life and know how he's doing.

13712,Non-Romantic,3d125k,"So, here we go. This morning, before Church, I noticed I likely wouldn't have enough time to be ready to go by the usual time my mother wanted me ready for (That is, 9:50 am) due to the fact that it took longer than expected to do my usual morning work out, and I needed a shower. Badly. I went to tell her this, letting her know calmly that if I wasn't ready by the time she wanted to leave for church, she was free to go without me, and I'd drive myself later, when I was ready, or stay home if that was unfeasible.  She immediately began being passive aggressive at me, stating that it was Stupid to take two cars to the same place and commenting what would {op's girlfriend's name} think of you not going to church (My girlfriend's Lutheran raised, but she hasn't said whether or not she still is religious. As far as mom knows she is, but I'm not sure, as my GF is down in the states, and I'm stuck up here in Canada), continuing on for a bit by saying If you want to call yourself a Christian, then act like it and be ready to go to church! then capping it off with Be ready by ten to ten, or you're not getting gas money.

Now, I'm in a bit of a tight financial situation, but I rarely, if ever, ask for money or help. I DESPISE asking for help, unless I absolutely have to. I especially never ask for gas money unless I have no other choice. I hate when people threaten me as well. My mom KNOWS all this, quite well in fact, but said that anyway. I quickly grew frustrated, then said Fuck it, go without me. I don't need this today. So I walked back downstairs, ignoring her yelling and swearing at me from outside.

I returned to my apartment, (Which I pay rent for, every month, on time, and have stated many times that she is not to enter without permission) and set about getting ready for the day. As I finished brushing my teeth and was about to start shaving, she came in through the outside entrance (which I often leave unlocked, as it's connected to the laundry room) and began yelling through the apartment for me.

I walked out, and she started apologizing (her words, not mine) saying she didn't like being like this in the morning, not before church, that she was sorry for swearing (This is the only part I believe), and that she was in prayer mode when I told her that she might need to go without me (She tends to get pissy when we're late, often berating me as I'm driving, which I am fed up to fucking HERE with *holds hand up to neck* and often apologizing after church, stating that she's sorry, but she needs to be there, the music feeds her soul. or some variation of that. I can understand that, as I need the music I listen to to help keep my emotions in check. However, at this point going to church has become a chore to me due to being forced to go all my life, regardless of my thoughts on the matter. Especially lately because of her yelling at me every Sunday, constantly blaming me when we're late.

After continuing to talk at me, more passive aggressive stupidity and guilt trips such as I love you, but..., I said once more Fuck it, I'm done with this. I'm done with your bullshit, I don't need this anymore. I'm not going to church with you anymore. I was about to say I don't need her passive-aggressive BS, to finish my point, when she got rather upset and stormed off, slamming the door behind her and swearing back at me as she did so.

It's now about 9:50, and as I'm sitting here typing this I can hear her getting ready to leave upstairs. I'm just done with this, I want to leave, but if I do she'll quickly lose the house and I won't have anywhere to stay. And as much as I dislike her personality, I can't subject her to that, because of my damned personal moral code, and the fact that I (in my eyes) owe her for raising me. It doesn't help that my father is a worse option, I haven't heard from him in seven years, and last time I did it was just before I was sent into a hell-hole of a foster home because he tricked me into recording a video say my mother was a bad parent to use in court.

Honestly, I don't really want to stay in contact with either of them, and I'm glad I haven't seen him in that long, as he was quite controlling and aggressive. But that's besides the point here, sorry.

Anyways, back to the financial issue aspect. I'm quite low on money, my check doesn't come in until the 29th and I haven't heard back from the other jobs I'm looking in to, so I'm stuck here AT LEAST until then, if not longer. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm just done.

I need some help guys. I need a way out. I want to be happy with my life, not stuck in this damn rut for another two years while I train to get my mechanic certification so I can fucking LEAVE this damn place and move down to America with my GF.

13722,Non-Romantic,27ung0,"Approx two weeks ago, my brotherly figure, lets call him Joe told me he liked a girl named Trina. I told my boyfriend (17M) because we're very open with each other and Tom has no one to tell anyway. When I was talking to my friend Queena, it was brought up and I almost accidentally told him, but I quickly changed the subject. I found out very quickly that my brotherly figure has only told ME that he liked Tom. 


Joe's automatic solution to the problem was to ask me if he could tell Queena that he liked me if it ever came up because Queena now knew that Joe liked someone. Now, before you say that its incest-y and gross, Joe isn't really my brother. We're very close friends so I just call him my brother. 


Joe was under the mindset that if he told Queena he liked me, then Joe could find out if Queena had a big mouth about peoples' secrets. (Background to this: Back in 8th grade, I liked a guy named Roland who went to Queena and Joe's school. When I told Queena, he wouldn't stop teasing me and Roland about it and it was super weird.) I agreed because I thought that this would just be a really quick oh I just want to know if he would then I'll tell Queena the truth things that Joe would do. (BTDUBS, MY BOYFRIEND WAS FINE WITH THIS.)

A few days after Joe told Queena, Joe told me that Queena believed it and that Joe didn't even have to use the lie and story he prepared for this if there were questions. I thought to myself, okay, well if Queena never says anything about Joe liking me, then Joe will tell Queena the truth.

Today, I was hanging out with a friend of Queena and I called Peeta. Peeta and I were talking and Peeta made a joke about how some guys like me. I told him that not a lot of guys like me and Peeta says that Queena knows a guy that likes me and that I should ask him.


When I got home, I asked Queena who liked me because I like knowing these things, and it got out that Joe never told Queena the truth. I decided to explain everything to Queena, and Queena got furious (for good reason, I mean, I don't blame him). After Queena finally cooled off and heard the whole story, He decided that he NEEDED to yell at Joe (I'm pretty sure that didn't actually happen though). 


At this point, its been a few hours, and Joe told Queena and me that he respects that if Queena doesn't want to be friends with him anymore but he NEEDS to talk to me about it. I really don't know what to say to him nor if I really want to be friends with him again. Graduation is in ~16 hours and we need help


-BACKGROUND ON Queena AND Joe's FRIENDSHIP:

13724,Non-Romantic,1snbt5,"My Grandmother has always been a somewhat snarky and crass woman, though in the past I've always had a good relationship with  her, and she's helped me out financially a few times over the years. She lives in a super rural area a few hundred miles from me, so I usually only see her once or twice a year. I email her maybe once every few months just to keep in touch. It had been a few months since I'd last contacted her (she never contacts me first) before this Christamas party that took place last weekend.

So at the party, everything is going on as awkwardly normal as any family Christmas party, until we all sit down to eat. As soon as everyone was seated, my Grandma asked me if I'd be playing music for everyone tonight. I told her I wasn't, since I've got too many other gigs going on right now and didn't have time to prepare anything. She then says, Well if you cared about your family at all you would have made the time. I told her that I was sorry and that I could send her some of my performance schedules and maybe her and my Grandpa could make it to one of my shows. She replied with, Do you even know how to use email? It seems like you forgot. Or you just forgot about me.

At this point everyone (30+ people) is staring at me, and I just sort of mumbled, How could I forget... and she basically dropped the subject after pointing out with a gleeful snideness that she'd embarrassed me in front of everyone. She was clearly amused at my reaction, which really, really pisses me off. I just kept my mouth shut, as I knew it wouldn't end well for me to contradict my family's matriarch in front of everyone. 

This really irritates me, because I DO email her every few months. In said emails, (which I always have to initiate if I want to hear from her) I tell her about what's going on with my life and ask her how her and my grandpa are doing, and what they're up to. She always replies with a two sentence complaint about her health and doesn't ask me a single question or say anything about anything else I said. It's impossible to actually sustain a conversation with her, so every few months we have basically that same conversation and I figured that was good enough. I would call her, but she lives in a very rural area and her phone service is really bad, so most of the time she doesn't get my calls.

Anyway, the party goes on, and later on during dessert she comes up to me and said she didn't mean to embarrass me in front of everyone, and then she made some quip about how embarrassing me like that should make me want to contact her more. I didn't really have anything to say to that, given the fact that she obviously did mean to embarrass me in front of everyone. She then says, I've never seen you so fat, why have you put on so much weight? The room quiets yet again, as I'm standing there red faced with no idea what the fuck to say to her. The kicker is, I've lost about 20 pounds since I last saw her. Thanks for noticing, Grandma. 

Thank god, my uncle said something to change the subject and I was saved from any further embarrassment. Once again, the party goes on. Later on she tells me that she wants me to come and visit her and she wishes she could spend more time with me. I was nice and basically told her I'd try to do that, but fuck, after this I really don't want to. 

I could understand if she pulled me aside and told me that she wished she heard from me more, or even if she did it in front of everyone and worded it more nicely. I just feel like the way she treated me was completely rude and uncalled for, and there were a million nicer ways she could have gone about it. 

I don't want to go to next year's party. I don't want to email her more, and I sure as hell don't want to spend a precious weekend visiting her. Especially since giving her what she wants as a result of her being rude to me is just going to encourage her to do it more in the future.

I have a truly great group of friends that I met in college.  We have been there for each other through some very, very tough times.  I love them, but I get so frustrated by them.

See, I tend to be the person who takes the lead on planning..well, everything.  We are trying to go on a trip this summer, and I am the person who is responsible for planning the trip.

Most times, this isn't a big deal because I'm just planning dinner or where we should go to hang out on a Saturday night, but this trip has been a different experience.  I have tried to take everyone's ideas into consideration, but it's really hard to please 10 people at a time.  I ultimately brought up/forced a plan for a trip that half of the group agreed on and half the group vehemently disagreed with.  This trip is coming up soon enough that someone needed to make a decision, and I now feel like I made the wrong decision.

Someone accused that I often make the decisions for the group, which is true, but they also said that they feel like their opinions never matter.  This makes me sad, but I can totally see where they are coming from.  I rationalize that I push my decisions because it is the only way that we would make a decision, but I now see that it could totally be seen as me forcing my agenda on everyone else.

So my question is thus: what do I do to make it seem like I am not forcing my own opinions and decisions on everyone?  I love everyone of my friends, and I really don't want them to feel like I don't value their decisions.  Also, what can I do in the future to make sure that I demonstrate to everyone that I value their decision?  At this point, I feel like walking away from the planning role and just letting someone else do it.

As I've gotten older and moved a few states away, she now plans these performances around when I come over to visit (and sometimes plans my visits around her recitals).  I visit perhaps 2-3x a year, and so perhaps 1-2x of those times, I am involved in some type of recital of hers or similar.

Recently I was making plans for my finacee (26/F) and I to visit my mom for thanksgiving.  Originally we made plans to visit in early November due to my fiancee's work scheduling conflict.  However, her work situation has changed, and we will now be coming in late November.  We're also coming down for Christmas just 1 month later.

My mom still wants me to come down in early November to perform at her recital, and has even offered to fly me there to perform.  However, traveling is a hassle, and I think 3 visits in a short amount of time, and coming just for this event, is a bit much.

I guess the broader question I have beyond this situation is how I should react to these invitations.  I have tried to decline them before, and it hasn't gone over well (we're a family and we do things for each other, other people your age come to visit much more etc). I got an e-mail today that started out Just want to check on the possibility of coming home to perform at XX but in reality it was all about airline tickets and arrival dates, and nothing about whether I want to come or whether I'm concerned about missing work to be there.  I'm often made to feel like it's assumed that I will come or that declining would be rude, and I'm concerned that taking the path of least resistance has troubling implications.

I'd like to feel like my visits home are actual *visits* and I don't have to be concerned with practicing and performing.  I feel like the prospect of continuing to do this a few times a year, as a perpetually ongoing concern, is a lot, and certainly an abnormal parent-child relationship.  I have said as much, but she really cannot see my point of view.  At the same time, I know that in some sense these recitals are her legacy of a lifetime of music teaching, and that she takes pride in my performances.  I also know that she's getting older, and they always say you will never wish you had spent less time with your parents.

And I don't want to be rude.  She gave my fiancee and I a very generous wedding gift a few months ago, and I suspect that refusing to take four days and do this for her in return would be a slap in the face.  But taking Friday/Monday off to come visit in a time that I'm already visiting a lot is sort of a large thing to want in my view.

So, I'm not really sure how to handle either this particular instance of this recital, or future requests.  Do I just suck it up and go?  Do I decline, knowing that it will stir up drama?

13744,Non-Romantic,2uviaq,"Since the job market sucks, I could only find work an hour away from where I live with my parents. I am interested in moving closer when I have the funds, but until then I am stuck driving an hour+ both ways through rush hour traffic. 

A few months into my job, I found out a coworker lives very close to me and he offered to carpool. This would be great! Cut down on gas, mileage on my car...I would lose out on my mornings singing in the car and getting my bearings for the day, but that was a sacrifice I was willing to make. 

Driving with him is horrible. He is a manipulative passenger seat driver and is in an inexplicable hurry to get to work. If my lane of traffic is going slow, he’ll go, “What are you doing, that lane is going faster!” He’s joking around, but that kind of talk stresses me out. Also, Heaven forbid I be a nice driver and let someone merge in front of me. When he drives, he’ll drive safely most of the time, but he tailgates and one time followed someone within inches because they weren’t going fast enough. He is the definition of the driver I can’t stand to have behind me in traffic. 

He’s friendly, but he’s also way too familiar and talks to me in what would be okay from a close friend, but not from a coworker 11 years older than me. I’m probably too much of a prude about stuff, but he’ll say things like, “We’ll be early to the office, so I’ll get to finish my coffee and poop before anyone gets there!” I have also heard some minor details of his and his wife’s sex life. Nothing explicit, just probably not the things his wife wants anyone else knowing. The other day he told a coworker to have a good weekend, and the coworker (who is a bit older) said, “Any weekend the doctor doesn’t say “legs back and spread ‘em” is a good weekend!” (Prostate exam reference?) This guy’s line of humor is along the same vein. I grew up around boys, so I’m usually immune or can join in with crude humor. This guy just makes me super uncomfortable. 

The deciding factor was yesterday I was sitting at a friend’s (25F) cubicle who he is also “buddy buddy” with. We were working on something and he comes up behind me and grabs a handful of my hair, shakes my head a little, and goes, “Look! It’s Trouble and Trouble!” In hindsight, I should have called him out, but I’m quiet by nature and tend to internalize things. I have a slow fuse, but at the end of that fuse is an explosive temper. He has no idea how close he came to me verbally lashing out at him in the middle of an open floor plan office. 

After that, he said something about he’d drive home and I could leave my car at work. I just told him thanks but I needed to drive home today. I also don’t feel comfortable leaving my car in a big city overnight. He’s pretty pushy so little excuses will only placate him for so long until I shut him down completely, and even after that he'll probably still bug me about it. I just don’t know how to do this without making our working relationship awkward. 

**TL;DR:** I don't want to carpool with my pushy coworker anymore, and I need to let him know without sacrificing our work relationship.

13771,Non-Romantic,2581yr,"My sister just had to forcefully resign from another job because she was having too many problems with people there and she is now thinking of applying for a job where I work. I am scared out of my mind that this will affect me as it's a very tight circle where everyone knows each other and people are very judgmental. She always manages to get people around her to hate or dislike her. I can't remember when was the last time she didn't have drama in her life. Part of it is because she is spoiled and always wants to be the center of attention. Dealing with people is difficult, it doesn't help if you have a strange personality.

I told her that she shouldn't even think of applying for a job where I work because it would make everything more complicated for me. I am currently very careful about how I deal with people at work. If I am associated with someone who is difficult it will screw things up for me. 

She told my parents about this and they are furious at me and say that I can't avoid being associated with my own sister, that I'm being selfish and unreasonable, etc. She is in part responsible for all of this happening to her because she is used to getting what she wants. I don't want to be involved in any of it and if she does begin working where I work it's going to be a huge headache for me and it will surely have consequences. I'm just really scared of losing my job or being treated like an outcast because I'm related to someone who isn't entirely sane. 

She's been coddled by my parents since she was born and bosses them around and treats them like crap. She thinks she can get away with that with people who aren't her parents. Today my parents said to me that everything bad that happened to her is my fault because instead of focusing 100% on her they were distracted by raising me. 

**tl;dr** My sister practically got fired from her job for being difficult to deal with and is now thinking of applying for a job where I work.  My parents hate me for not wanting her to work in the same place I do. Am I being unreasonable to not want my life to get screwed over because of her actions?

13772,Non-Romantic,1pd63f,"So basically, I'm the guy where I have my group of friends and I've never really strayed away from that. But this is my senior year, and in all four of my core classes, I have this girl in there. Now I'm not trying to date her or anything, just straight trying to be a friend, to kind of broaden my base. But in all of the classes she's really acts like she's a friend and like chill.. 

This is hard to explain because I'd never thought I'd have to ask how to make a friend. But let me continue. So I've known this girl from like early middle school, I've just never talked to her a bunch. But first few weeks of school, she asked for us to exchange numbers since we have all of these class, and we end up trading homework a lot. Well she was saying how she wanted to go to a haunted house, blah blah blah we have a mutual friend that was already going with us, she says she would go, ends up never answering any text about it, and she ended up telling me that she went to one already because we didn't invite her. So basically she really only answers texts if it's school related, and never really wants to talk outside of school. Once again, no intentions at all of dating this girl, I just want to know why it's so fucking hard to make a friend. I'm not sure if she thinks I'm trying to date her or what. But idunno. She's still really cool in school, but get out of school and nothing. Maybe I should face the reality that I'm not going to graduate with a lot of friends I guess. Just my 6-10 that I've always had. 

Sorry for it being so long, but I'm genuinely confused if I'm doing anything wrong, or if it's just that hard to make new friends...

She was getting tired of all that medical stuff and decided, together with her husband, to make the best out of her last years.
Her husband has been very supportive, they traveled the world, bought a house and 4 years later she gave birth to their daughter. The tumor was nearly forgotten since her health condition was pretty stable and the tumor didn’t grow. 


Yesterday, my dad called me to tell me her health condition is declining dramatically and the tumor started growing. She randomly gets aggressions and even temporarily paralysis. But the most overwhelming part for me is, that she is planning to commit an assisted suicide at her parents house in the next few week. It’s so unbelievably heartbreaking and I feel so sorry for her 4 year old daughter, for her husband, her parents, everyone.


My dad further told me, if I want to say goodbye, then the time is now. I definitely what to do that, but it’s just that I really never had much contact with her since my teenage years.

13802,Non-Romantic,2vpbny,"People in question are my mother [48f], brother [20m], and sister [19f]. 

To preface, I don't think my family are bad people. They're good people who have had bad things happen to them, but they make bad decisions when it comes to dealing with those bad things.

To keep this concise as possible I don't trust my mother's judgement. She married an abusive asshole, stayed in the relationship for 14+ years, and only divorced him when he gave her papers because he thought she was cheating on him. She wasn't, but that's beside the point. Shortly after the end of her marriage, she got involved with another guy who turned out to be a diagnosed sociopath. He almost certainly raped my sister, (who was &gt;13 at the time), but there was no evidence beyond he said she said so nothing came about of the investigation. He also has a habit of fucking anything that moves, and late last year he got one of his flings pregnant. Now, my mother knows most of this and has made overtures to the family about leaving, but she's taking her sweet time doing it. 

She also over-commits to everything but the family. Growing up, she was heavily involved in church and our schools. These days, she's part of a local veteran's advocacy group. She seems more than willing to put in the time for outside things like friends or organizations, but is constantly indisposed whenever something actually needs to happen. Her go-to reasoning is that she didn't expect them to come up, which kind of blows my mind considering how frequent they happen. 

---

As far as my brother is concerned, I flat out don't trust him, period. He has shown terrible judgement when it comes to romantic partners, (one of his ex's stole jewelry from my mother). He's inconsiderate, arrogant, loves to play the victim card when confronted with his behavior, and has no sense of personal identity; he's always emulating someone or something. He's also an addict and has stolen money from my grandmother to pay for weed, (yeah, yeah, weed's not physically addictive. Point is, the kid can't stay sober if he can help it), and if he's not high, he's probably drunk or is planning to be. We've given him resources for rehab and recovery, but he refuses to utilize them. And I know this sounds incredibly petty, but he'll jump in the middle of a series I'm watching on Netlfix, (without having watched the previous episodes), and then skip ahead of me. 

---

My sister is clingy as hell and can't stay quiet to save her life; the girl has no filter. Her communication skills also leave quite a bit to be desired, often leading to confusion and frustration. She'll also just randomly interrupt whenever I'm doing something to tell me a story or show me something on her phone. She's honestly the easiest one to deal with, but it's still profoundly annoying. 

---

Here's my background: When I was 17, I moved away from my stepdad to my grandmother's. I finished high school and joined the military, but was diagnosed with a serious mental illness before I could finish basic training. I've been in therapy off and on every since. Around 2 years ago, I was (voluntarily) hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, and have been SERIOUSLY pursuing therapy ever since. Between medication and an awesome therapist, I've made some serious strides in my recovery. I've recently become a certified Peer Support Specialist and I'm currently looking for work in the next town over. 

In the meantime though, I still have to put up with my brother and sister. We're all living with my grandmother still, and things are... crowded. It's really, really hard to not have any private space any more, and it's made me seriously question the health of my relationship with my family. I don't bear them any ill-will, but I'm sick and tired of being caught up in my family's drama and being expected to bail them out of the consequences of their bad decisions; I've got my own shit to deal with.

**TLDR**

My family makes bad decisions, doesn't respect boundaries, and often looks to me to bail them out of the fire. I've got my own shit to deal with and my own life to live, and I feel like they're getting in the way of that, even if inadvertently.

13805,Non-Romantic,2ojosr,"Hi, so this is a throwaway account because I have family on reddit.  Basically my mom's side of the family imploded after my grandmother died 12 years ago.  Mom was the executrix of the estate and followed the will to the letter. 

My aunt and uncle (Mom's sister and brother) weren't satisfied with their shares of the will and demanded more from my mother.  Mom made some concessions to keep them happy but when they asked for even more, she put her foot down and they immediately disowned her.  And when I say disowned, I mean DISOWNED.  They told my mother that she was no longer a sister to them and cut off all contact with us. I never seen or spoken to my aunt and uncle or any of my cousins on that side of the family since then.  

Flash forward 12 years to the present day.  I'm independent and living on my own.  I live across the country from Mom but we're still close and talk once or twice a week.  Out of curiosity I decided to look up my long-lost cousins on Facebook and I found their profiles without too much difficulty.  I'm conflicted on what to do.

On the one hand, I had a fairly good relationship with all of my cousins at the time of our parents' falling out.  I feel life is too short to hold grudges and I would like to have us become involved in each others' lives again.  I think we would have developed into tight-knit group of cousins if the circumstances with my grandma's estate hadn't  torpedoed family relations. 

On the other hand, if I reach out to any of the cousins, there is a possibility that my aunt and/or uncle will find out.  I have no idea if my cousins are on good terms with their parents.  You see, my aunt and uncle are both bad news.

My aunt is mother to my two older cousins [31M] and [29M] and from what i remember she's always been wild, irresponsible, and bad at decision-making and managing money.  My family was very conservative but she had a wild streak: she got covered in tattoos and rode a Harley.  She eventually divorced my cousins' dad and moved in with a creepy biker guy who always joked about violence, which made family gatherings awkward and eventually he broke her jaw in a domestic dispute.  She stayed with him despite that.  On top of that, my aunt was always broke from living beyond her means.  She was always upside-down on leases and had a new car every year or so. I suspect she wanted more money from the estate so that she could pay off her various creditors and then spend whatever was left.

But while my aunt is a misguided free spirit, my uncle is much more sinister.  He has had a gambling addiction since he was a teenager and over the course of his life has engaged in all sorts of petty crimes  to support his habit.  He's done everything from identity theft to check fraud to larceny. He caused my grandparents no small amount of heartache and he has burned countless bridges with family and friends just to feed his addiction. At one point, he dropped out of pharmaceutical school but told no one and convinced my grandparents to send him checks for tuition which were then gambled away.  His habit has cost him two marriages and he's been foreclosed on multiple times.  The man has no conscience whatsoever.  I don't think he has any violent tendencies (at least none that I was aware of when I knew him) but at the same time I wouldn't be surprised if he does have them.  My three younger cousins are his kids.  

So in conclusion, my concern is that if I reach out to my cousins, particularly my uncle's kids, my aunt and uncle will make an effort to insert themselves into my life or my parents' lives.  The problem is, I do not want anything to do with them unless they reconcile with my mother first (of their own volition, which is unlikely) and even then I would keep them at arm's length, especially my uncle.  Also, I have a feeling that my uncle's kids might not even remember me since the oldest was 6 the last time I saw her.   

I assume that if I do nothing, my parents and I will just continue to live life without them as we have for the past dozen years.  I think it's highly unlikely my uncle or aunt make any attempt to reconcile with me or with my parents unless they have some ulterior motive (money). 

So what do you think, reddit?  Is this reuniting with my cousins a goal worth pursuing or will I just be opening Pandora's box?

I probably did a huge mistake last night, or at least I'm already regretting it. I just moved on a new flatshare with a guy and a girl, and yesterday we were having our first night out: predrinks, drinks at a pub, and more when coming back to the flat.

We definitely managed to break the ice, maybe way too much: after some really light flirting (I am your average guy really oblivious to hints &amp; more...) the girl took me to her room and told me that she wanted to cuddle.

Short version, in my intoxicated state, I liked the idea of having sex with her, but I left for my room, she came back to pick me up only in panties and a top 1 hour later. I followed her in her bed, we made out a lot, but she draw a line and we didn't go too far, even managed to keep our underwear on!

I left to my room after she felt asleep.
Today I'm very happy she prevented us from doing it, and I'm concerned about my relationship to her and the flatshare environment in general.

As I told her when we started kissing, for me this was only casual, and I kind of fished for information, seeking if she would be interested in a FWB, which she wasn't keen on; but also telling me that she wasn't looking for anything serious at this moment of her life.

I left for work this morning, and won't be able to discuss that with her until tonight. I don't know how she feels about that yet, and I want to find the right words to get her to understand that my priority is having a good (platonic) relationship with my flatmates, and a good atmosphere at home, ideally being close friends. What happened yesterday was because alcohol made me short sighted and I went for what was enjoyable in the moment.

My difficulty is that I don't if I should be cold when saying so, or being delicate, friendly and trying to not hurt her feelings.

13809,Non-Romantic,2pepum,"I first met this guy, we'll call him Tim, through a mutual friend about a year ago. That was the only time I saw him until August when he found me on Facebook and said he had some issues with roommates and their lease, and that he needed a place to crash for a little while so he could sort out his living situation. I remembered him being a pretty chill guy (and I kind of had a stupid lust for him) so I said okay and picked him up.

It was as we pulled into my lot that he got around to telling me he was trying to quit heroin. Fuck. At that point I knew it was probably a bad idea, but I couldn't muster up the courage to change my mind. I told him as long as it wasn't used in my house, then whatever.

From the get-go he went to bed at a reasonable hour and woke up early to go out and meet with shelter administrators, school officials, therapy counselors, etc. Or so he said. He didn't have ID or health insurance and claimed he wanted to get into school for medicine or some such, so I figured that made sense.

Tension started to build when I realized he kept bringing his backpack into the bathroom for showering. At first I didn't think much of it, but eventually I heard tinkering noises from the bathroom and maybe what sounded like a lighter being lit. It was hard to tell since obviously the shower was on and the pipes are loud, but he would be in there for at least 45min. When he came out he didn't seem high, so I brushed it off.

A week or two later, I had a friend of his, Andrew, (who I hung out with a couple times years ago) stay with us for a night. Andrew is a very strange character who kept talking about nonsense philosophical views.
 
The next morning I took them out to eat. Andrew decided he would head downtown from there, so we left him and I brought Tim back home before going to work. When I came home he wasn't here, and $1000+ of my belongings were gone. It was a little later that I heard back from Tim with an elaborate story about how Andrew came back while I was at work and rushed for them both to get on a local bus, and when Tim got on the bus Andrew ran off at the last second. Implying Andrew went back to my place and took my things. I filed a police report with full names and descriptions of them and my belongings.

After days of back and forth discussion with Tim about the situation, I eventually concluded that he wouldn't have waited so long to steal from me. He had plenty of chances before to do it while I was at work, so it couldn't have been him. It had to be Andrew. 

I let Tim come back over.

My next clue to his drug use was that he started going to sleep earlier, so when I get home from work around 10 he's already in bed. Okay, fine... Until one night I get back and he hadn't gone to sleep just yet. He was completely slurred and speaking euphorically. Not in a simply drunk kind of way. I sleep on it and firmly restate my initial rule the next morning, adding that he needs to set his mind on a job if he really wants to get back on his feet. (He got his ID.)

So he ended up getting getting hired at McDonald's right down the street. He was excited for it, but of course he had to fuck that up. Called off on the first day. Lied to his manager the second day about thinking his shift was PM instead of AM. He must have worked less than 5 total days before probably getting fired for his endless excuses.

He starts dealing drugs (again) to make money. It seemed like everyday he would come back to complain about something ridiculous. I got mugged. I almost got arrested. My friend won't give me any drugs to sell. This is the point that I finally start getting unbearably frustrated. I tell him I don't think there's much else I can do to help; that eventually you're going to need to figure something out. He shamefully replied I know. 

Some time later, I get into a car accident on my way home from seeing an old friend. No one was hurt, but my car is no longer functional. The very next day he begs me via text to let him bring another friend over for a night, even after I told him I had been in an accident. I stood my ground and told him no. I needed some peace, and I was done falling for his bullshit. He seemed to have gotten the clue because when he came back he simply grabbed his things and left.

I didn't hear from him until two weeks later when he asks to come back. “I got screwed over. There were still a few clothes of his here, so I let him back for one last night saying that I can no longer be a permanent solution. The original cry for help was for a few days, maybe a couple weeks. A long-term stay was never discussed. He said he had a new place to go and was getting picked up the next morning.

Again, he plays the helpless victim. Asked if I was sure he couldn't stay. I'm afraid not, I say. He cries, then gets pissy in an attempt to justify himself. I'm only moving 2 hours away because I have no where else to go. I wish I had some heroin to kill myself because no one fucking cares.

He packs his bag. I guess this is goodbye. I reply with a semi-sympathetic Good luck.

Gone.

I am embarrassed to have ever thought he could grow up and fix himself, let alone to have been directly involved in it. I had never been in a situation like this before so I felt like I had to try, and I didn't even really know him. I can't help but feel guilty for failing though. I kept wanting more, but I'm glad I realized it wasn't going to happen. Not with me anyway. I'm glad it didn't get much worse. I'm glad that my lust and his manipulation never escalated sexually. I seriously wish the best for him, but it was time for me to wash my hands of his problems.

Now it has been 2-3 weeks since he left, and I've just received a letter from him. He is in jail, apologizing and asking me for bail money/inmate funds. He also named a couple people to contact for help, but after all I've been through with him I feel like the best help he can get right now would be to stay locked up just to get sober and face the reality of his broken life. At least there are professionals there who can handle things far better than I could.

**TL;DR Met a guy. Let him stay for a while. Found out he's hooked on heroin but trying to quit. Things don't improve, so I kick him out. Drug addicts need real rehabilitation. Do not try to help them alone. You will only get hurt.**

Should I respond to his letter? Contact his friends? Has anyone else ever been in a similar situation? How did you handle it? What was the result? Am I an asshole? :\

I've known this friend since I was about 9 years old, but we got much closer when I got to high school. We're fairly affectionate with each other (hugs and the like) and he sometimes calls me his little sister and I'll sometimes call him my big brother. He's easy to talk to, a lot of fun to hang out with, have almost all of the same interests, and have similar personalities. I don't care about him in a romantic way, but I care a lot about him as a person and consider him to be one of my best friends. I know he cares about me and considers me a good friend, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't care about me as much as I care about him. Sometimes I'll message/text him and he won't respond at all (sometimes I'll worry if he's angry with me or something but the next time we see each other in person nothing's ever strange), recently I asked him if he wanted to hang out over a long break and he never got back to me, little things like that, plus I can sort of just tell that I don't really matter to him as much as he does to me.

The other part of this is that I know he cares much more about his girlfriend and it also seems like he cares more about two of his other friends. I'll know he'll talk to them more than he'll talk to me and again, I can kind of just tell that he cares more about them than me. His girlfriend especially is a great person, but occasionally I'll get jealous that he gives so much of his attention to her (this I know is a personal issue). 

I would hate to simply end the friendship just because I'm feeling a little hurt, but I also don't know if I should talk to him about it or not. I've asked him before if I was ever annoying him and told me that if I ever did in the future to please let me know (he responded with a confused no). I'm sure part of this is just me being sensitive and overreacting. He might also think I'm crazy/super sensitive if I bring it up and I wouldn't want him to think that. I also wouldn't want him to feel uncomfortable or make it seem like I don't like his friends or his girlfriend because I really do. I also don't want him to feel like he has to lie to me and say that he really cares about me if he doesn't, nor do I want him to feel like he has to put in more effort into the friendship than he wants to, thus making him unhappy. I guess I'm just unsure of what to do/ how to go about this.

13838,Non-Romantic,3gjh0l,"Growing up, I usually heard Why can't you be like your siblings?  I was stuffed full of ADHD drugs, forced to go to therapists that I did not like or trust, and was mostly just told I was evil, bad, and full of darkness.  My sister was beautiful, my brother was cool, and I was butterball, our little snaggletooth, or just a little shit.  I really tried to earn the love and respect of my family, but since I was the bad kid on ADHD drugs, I could never really shake that label loose.  My siblings ganged up on me, my family ganged up on me, and I just never felt like I belonged.  I love you but I don't like you, was something I heard a lot.

Anyway, about a year ago I was working a job I hated and was dating an amazing guy long distance.  I decided to take a chance- I quit my job in the Midwest and moved to Los Angeles to be with him.  My parents were furious.  They claimed I was insane, that I was completely unstable, and that I couldn't possibly survive without them.  But guess what; things have been PHENOMENAL.  After a serious health scare, unemployment, and some pretty bad depression, I emerged on the other side with my dream job, some working SSRIs, and a gym plan that's already given me results!  Moving here was the best thing I've ever done, and I've been pretty low contact with my family.  My mental health has never been better, and I feel like my OWN person.  I'm slowly learning that I'm not evil and bad, I'm just me and that is great.  My boyfriend has been incredibly successful as well, and we've really made a great life for ourselves in this city.  I've accepted that I can't change my family and I can't change the past-- I'll never have the kind of relationship I dreamed of.  My boyfriend and friends love me in the ways that I wished my family had, and that's good enough for me!

However, while things were going great for me, they haven't been so great for my siblings.  My sister [23F] has been planning her wedding, and received the devastating news that her father in law has cancer and might not make it to the end of the year.  Her mother in law has always had poor mental health mixed with alcoholism, but had really turned it around the last few years.  Well, after this news she went off the deep end again, and is drinking and back to square one.  They can't rely on either of them for wedding planning or really any support at all, and also are refusing to share details of the father in law's prognosis.

My brother [29M] got married 3 years ago, and his wife is in med school.  Unfortunately, she has been spending less and less time with him, taking vacations with only her family, and has now told us that she won't be going to my sister's wedding.  We used to text a lot and now she won't respond to any of my messages or emails, and my brother has confessed that their marriage is failing.  The stress from school has been too much for the two of them, and they are growing apart.

My parents have been calling me a lot, upset that they haven't heard from me.  I think at this point I'm just their good news factory because everything else seems to be going to shit.  I've been given a ton of pressure to reach out to my siblings and give them my love and support, but honestly I have no idea what to even say.  Sorry about your inlaws? Too bad about your marriage?  Look I know you always told me I wasn't going to amount to anything but haha guess what I'm doing great also I'm sorry?

I know how to be supportive to my friends, but I guess I don't know how to support my family when I've just never been close to them.  I don't fight with my siblings like I did when I was a kid, but there's a level of resentment that keeps us separate.  I'm just not close with these people.  I don't tell them anything emotional because they use it against me like a weapon, and I guess they've just been people that I have baby pics with and I see at holidays.

13843,Non-Romantic,37fc09,"Backstory:
My dad and I have a difficult relationship. He has always had a temper, and as kids my two brothers and I frequently endured him screaming at my mother in the middle of the night along with silent treatments that could last several months or more. When he and my mother separated when I was 14, I proceeded to go no contact with him for the better part of seven years by choice, until I extended the olive branch by inviting him to my university graduation. 

Over the past eight years, our relationship has been cordial but not terribly close. I live in another state, 600 miles away from his place. I've always tried to keep the relationship positive even when he tries to speak ill of my mother or guilt me for the years of no contact. I feel no guilt over that. Until last year, we'd speak on the phone once every few months, and I'd spend time with him when I was back home, even though I had to split my time between him and my mom since they will not associate with one another. He's visited me once during the 6.5 years I've lived in my current city. 

Two years ago, my girlfriend of then 3 years and I moved in together. When I announced this to my dad, he judged us, saying it was immoral and against his beliefs, despite not being terribly religious. I mostly laughed it off at the time. I'm an adult and I'll do as I please with my relationships and finances. What bothered me, however, was that just a few months after my partner and I moved in together, he began dating again (which I took as great news!) - and promptly moved in with his new girlfriend. Then, around this time last year, while on a camping trip with my older brother, my brother revealed that he discovered my dad has been smoking pot for years. Now, the smoking doesn't bother me at all, as I smoke myself. Just like how co-habitation doesn't bother me, as I live with my partner too. What bothers me is the hypocrisy. My dad doesn't drink and rails against anything habit-forming, which pot most definitely can be. I should note, the co-habitation hypocrisy bugs me much more than the smoking hypocrisy. 

Issue:
My dad's birthday is coming up. Last time I spoke with him via phone was on his last birthday, when I called him. A few months before that, I called spoke to him for the first time in about six months, for all of twenty minutes before he cut the call short to go watch nascar. Our only other communication in the last year has been a text on Thanksgiving and Christmas, and a thank you note I sent him for the card and check he'd sent me at Christmas. 

My partner graduated from university earlier this month, and in five days we will be moving 1300 miles to a new city two states away. I even mentioned the move in the thank you note I sent my dad, but still, nothing from him - no congratulations to my partner of now five years, no good luck with the move - he doesn't even know where we're moving as our plans shifted slightly since I sent him the thank you note.

At this point, I'm definitely offended by his behavior. On the one hand, I don't want to be responsible for any damage to our relationship, however distant it may be. I also don't want to fight with my dad about his hypocrisy and blatant lack of interest in my life. On the other hand, I'm done taking my dad's shit and decided long ago that we will either have a cordial relationship, or no relationship at all. I don't want to be solely responsible for visiting, calling, and acting like everything is fine, despite my hurt feelings. 

Questions:
Should I call my dad on his birthday? Should I confront him about his hypocrisy? And how should I approach this relationship moving forward, especially now that I will be living even further from home and potentially visiting even less than I'm able to now? I should mention, in my opinion, I don't believe my dad is upset with me. I think he genuinely just doesn't care, despite what he claims.

Advice and input is welcome. Thanks in advance.

**tl;dr**: My dad and I have a difficult history, but things had been going okay up until a year ago. Do I extend the olive branch by calling him on his birthday? Should I confront him for being a hypocrite? How do I manage this relationship moving forward?

edit:

UPDATE:

First of all, I want to express my thanks to those of you who weighed in with insight in this thread. It helped me better understand the state of the relationship as well as giving me ideas for managing the relationship moving forward.

I ended up calling my dad to wish him a happy birthday. This was not in deference to the excellent advice I received, but more a decision based on my opinion that the current state did not yet warrant a full-on cutting of contact. I kept it light, talking about his job and the work he's doing on his home, as well as filling him in on essential details regarding our upcoming move. He was almost taken aback at the announcement that we're moving this coming weekend, even though he'd gathered bits and pieces from my little brother (not to mention that this move has been almost four years in planning). He also apologized for not wishing my partner congratulations on her graduation (which little brother also clued him in on), saying he didn't realize the ceremony took place in May, not June. I'll take him at his word, though it doesn't change much. The phone call clocked in at 18 minutes, short and sweet.

Moving forward, I'm determined to approach this relationship in a more emotionally detached manner from my end. Until there is outright hostility from him which warrants no contact, I'll plan on a birthday phone call, a text on the other holidays, and not much else. I've accepted that I will probably never be close with my dad, but it's mostly on him. I will try to not let my feelings get hurt when it's been several months or more without contact. Also, I am going to take the advice regarding pruning, and try to downplay those family relationships which cause me stress while devoting more love and energy to the few good ones I have. This includes my partner's family, who have been unbelievably supportive as we worked out the details of this move, and are just wonderful people in general.

All in all, I feel like I managed to position myself as the good guy while still playing my cards close to the chest. There was no real progress, but no real damages for either party, and I can live with that for now.

As a longtime lurker of this wonderful sub, I couldn't think of a better community to seek advice from on this matter, and I really appreciate the input I received.

13868,Non-Romantic,298w42,"A couple of weeks ago, my dad had to go to spain for work, around ten days. I was having a light week with college, so I got to spend more time with my mom. Like I would get home from my classes and go chill to her room. But I noticed some weird things about her. She wasn't talking to me as much or asking me about my stuff (which she usually does), a couple of times I got home and she was doing nothing with her lights off, she wakes up around 3-4 am and does nothing for a couple of hours.

So I was a bit worried, but my mom has always been a strong figure to me, so I thought maybe it was just my imagination. I was planning a trip to my bf's hometown (Hour and a half from mine) the weekend my dad was supposed to come back. It turned out that he couldn't make it because of work, and called me early in the morning. He asked me not to go away, because my mom was feeling a bit down, so he wanted me and my brother to keep her company. I said I was okay with it, since I has already sensed something was off with her. So I called my bf, he understood my situation, and although I wanted to see him, I though my mom was more important in that moment.

So I get home and had to lie, saying that the girl who was taking me bailed and that I would stay home (i didn't tell her i stayed because of her since my dad asked me not to, and i didn't want her to feel guilty of anything). And my brother invited her to the movies. Eventually she found out and asked me directly, so I coulnd't lie to her.

My mom: You and your brother really shouldn't cancel your plans because of me.
Me: I know, but I was really worried about you. You've been acting weird, and I just wanted to keep you company. I don't mind not seeing him one day if it is to be with you, if you are feeling sad.

We talked a bit about it. She said she believed she was a bit depressed over the menopause (which she had several years ago, around 40). I dind't really know what to say, so I just told her it was okay, that I was there for her, and just stayed with her for the rest of the day.

Today, I noticed she was still in bed pretty late (which is not something she does, at all). I went to check on her, and she seems to have been crying. I got stuck. I didn't know what so say. I know she's depressed, but can't get myself to say something to her. I don't know what to say or do. It's hard for me because this is so unlike my mom, which usually is a pretty strong and confident person.

I really need some advice on how to approach the subject with her. I don't feel I'm confident enough to just sit down and talk things over with her. I'm also afraid she won't listen that way (she is really caring about her loved ones, but always dismisses her own health).

13871,Non-Romantic,2vs816,"I will try and keep this short, but as these relationship problems go, they tend to become long winded.  A general overall of my current situation.  At 23 I met a woman, and despite knowing about a year and a half into the relationship that it was not going to work, circumstances prevailed and we continued dating, and eventually got married.  Surprise to no one, our marriage did not work out and as of this writing we separated 18 months ago and our divorce has been finalized for the past 4 months. 

Now, I don't really want to get into the reasons of why I stayed in a relationship for so long, despite knowing better, however one of the consequences or our split is that I kept our dog.  I was really the only one who took care of her, walked her, fed her, took her to the dog park, etc, even though my ex-wife had far more of an emotional connection with the dog.

Since my ex and I split I moved in with an acquaintance of mine, that at first was fine, but now after living together for almost a year and a half I'm at my wits end with him.  He hardly cleans up after himself, he eats my food, drinks my beer, I can't keep hard liquor around because he would just kill half a bottle in one night and not say anything.  It is pretty obvious that he has a drinking problem. He also has a chihuahua that is constantly marking territory in our place.  He is not a completely awful roommate, he regularly walks my dog for me, and watches her when I go out of town or sleep over at my girlfriend's house.  He also has mainly stopped doing all the annoying habits of helping himself to my food and drink, but remains almost completely unaware of his dog's marking habits.  Regardless of his annoying habits, at this point in my life, I'm a grown-ass man, and tired of having a roommate.  

Now about a year ago I met a lovely woman, and our relationship has been really great.  We get along swimmingly, she affords me all the time and space that I lacked in my previous relationship, and she exhibits hardly any of the parts that drove me crazy about my ex.  However, she is applying to grad schools and could potentially move away in the next few months, so we are sort of in a holding pattern on the direction of where our relationship is going until she finds out where she will be living in the fall. 

Regardless of how bright I can see our future together, I really want to move into my own place and just have my own space before potentially moving in and moving on with someone.  This leads me to my current situation and general unhappiness.  Despite having a good job, and a solid career, I live in one of the more expensive places in the country, where demand on apartments is through the roof.  I make a decent salary (~$60k) a year, and could afford to live on my own here, but finding a place that I can 1) afford, 2) allows pets and 3) is in a neighborhood that I want to be in is turning out to be impossible.

Now this next part is why I am using a throwaway account, because I know I will end up getting a lot messages saying what a terrible person I am.  I am over having my dog.  There, I said it out loud.  I don't want the responsibility anymore, I don't need this constant reminder of my past failures.  I don't have the deep emotional connection towards that Kevin Smith has.  I do the bare minimum in terms of taking care of her.  She stays well fed, walked and socialized, but I'm just over it.  After 11 years of having her, I want out.  Finding an apartment without a dog would be so easy.  I also am in a fair amount of debt, so in my head I know I should just shut up, stay the course, pay down debt and then move out when the timing is better. 

So that's where I'm at reddit.  I'm unhappy where I am currently living, and having trouble finding a new place.  I realize I should just shut up and deal with it, pay down some debt to free up more of a monthly allotment that I could put towards a more expensive place that would allow dogs, but in the mean time I find my mental and emotional state being drained.  

I guess I just wrote this out to hear myself talk, but if anyone has any advice on what to do, or have found yourselves in similar situations, I would love to hear it.

The same goes with all the other ones. I'm normally a really friendly person, but whenever I see the others, I just say hi back if they say hi, and I brush it off. Two of the girls each owe me some money as well, as I lent them some when we were still friends, but whenever I ask them (it's been a month), they just say they don't have the money. **mini tl;dr** *they're crappy people I still have to deal with occasionally because they are in my living vicinity lol*



Today, one of the girls living near me got locked out of her dorm and asked me to call the other girls to let her in. I thought about not calling them, but felt that that would've been petty, she's just locked out of her dorm. So I call &amp; text both of them, and unsurprisingly neither of them reply. I tell the girl who was locked out that neither of them picked up, and I wasn't surprised because neither of them liked me (I wanted to see her reaction) and she just snorted/chuckled and looked down instead of denying it. **Should I have texted/and called the other girls for her or leave her locked out? One of her roommates would come soon anyways. Am I being too nice?**



I've never been in this situation before, but I guess there's going to be more people in the future like this. I don't like these people, and whenever I see them I would rather act the way I feel around them, and just brush them off, instead of being fake like them and smiling. (It's ironic how some of the things they accused me of were being fake and a liar. People project the qualities they hate about themselves in others, I guess). I haven't asked the girl who told me about what was going on to tell me anymore of what they were saying about me because I would rather not hear it, if it's not true or going to help me anyways. I don't really have time to be constantly worried about what others think about me, especially people like them.



*I guess what I'm asking is, should I act how I feel inside about them (kind of pissed off and unfriendly), or act professionally (with no emotion at all). It's hard and new for me to be anything but friendly, but I feel conflicted just thinking about being nice to them. If they come up to me and ask for favors, they're always asking from me and never giving back, should I do it?*

**tl;dr**: **I'm seeing a group of people who used to be my friends on a daily basis around school. I've cut them off because I found out that they were talking shit about me, they don't know I know. I'm feeling a lot of things I haven't experienced before and would like some second thoughts on them.**


* Is it wrong to pity or look down on them for being insecure about themselves to the point where they feel the need to talk shit about others?


* I'm not sure how to act around them, unfriendly, or professionally (sorry can't think of a better word atm), without feeling uncomfortable since I'm so used to being super friendly with everyone. Would it be rude to act this way in public? As of now, I don't talk anymore then necessary to with them.


* If they ask for any favors big or small should I do them? I don't want to, because I don't see any reason to, but how do I refuse a favor? I don't want to lie.

I have a friend that lives in a tiny Florida town stuck in a bad family life.


She's had rheumatoid arthritis ever since she was a child, which at times crippled her. She's also dealt with life-long anxiety, hunger due to lack of funds, an abusive stepfather, manipulative family members, and other issues.


She graduated high school, is an excellent writer, a lover of books, etc., but this means little due to her situation. She only recently got over the worst flare-up of arthritis she's ever had, which confined her to her room for months, forcing one of her legs to lose much of its muscle mass (until it was 1/2 the size of the other), and ended with her addicted to pain meds from the doc's prescription.


This arthritis flare-up is now over (although the addiction is still there), and she's started to exercise, hike, clean up her diet as far as possible re: her funds, etc., but due to the ongoing stress of family life, she can have another 'attack' at any time. This is especially bad as she's the only one in her family that gives a damn about her own health, and is made to feel bad for not wishing to stuff herself with TV dinners and other crap every night. Recently, her mother went off and threatened to commit suicide (part of a string of attention-seeking behavior), and the girl's not able to sleep due to fights, stress, and feeling like a burden. These fights occur every single day and the manipulations are non-stop. They even occurred while she was confined to her room, while hospital visits took a back-seat to other family 'obligations', and both her immediate family and grandparents made her feel bad for being so dependent on them -- despite her inability to walk, stand, or sleep.


Given all this, it means that her arthritis can come back at any time since it comes and goes according to highly stressful episodes, as do many autoimmune 'flare ups'. She wants to move out and get a job, but given that she's literally in the middle of nowhere with no car, no real public transit, and no money, this is especially hard. She considered the army, but given her history of health issues and meek, sheltered demeanor, this is probably not an option. She has also considered the shelter where her family once stayed, but given that there is screaming and fighting there, too, she'll only go as a last resort.

She has a self-destructive streak, and although I don't think she'd ever kill herself, she deals with stress by hurting herself. In fact, her entire family has this pattern of behavior. The difference is that she recognizes it and wants to stop, and even has a good number of healthy outlets, yet sees little possibility of exercising them due to circumstances.


Do you guys know of any options she might have, even if they involve going to another state? She's already looking into a few group homes for the disabled, but not sure if she'll qualify, as she's presently walking. Are there any other organizations that might deal with this sort of thing? Perhaps rehab, given her ongoing addiction? She doesn't have any close friends who could help her.


Thanks.

So my mother is having tons of issues with my family and all the people in it, she says she does not get any support from anyone, her brother, mother, or dad (who lives in the apartment attached to the house). I think the reason she does so is because she yells at anyone who disagrees with her, and belittles them, using personal attacks in an argument. She is usually really nice, but when she gets going, it's going to take at least a day for her to calm down.

She had broken up with her husband over years of issues, and mental issues, they have been fighting for as long as I can remember, same for my siblings at 24 and 19. We all still live together however, due to money issues, and my mom not being employed at the moment. (she's trying really hard recently, almost has one) The idea is that we can all move out to our own house, and my dad gets his own. They disagree, and my mom may have to force the sale of the house at great lawyer costs. 

That kind of gives a bit of back story to what is happening, fast forward to today, and she was yelling at her dad over not supporting her, me and him think alike, so I think that he just really wanted to stay out of it, and not take any sides, but she took that as him snuffing her, and not wanting to be supportive, so she had a lengthy yelling session at him. He is 84, and I really think she should apologize, because I really don't think she means most of the stuff she says.

She'll never go to apologize, you always have to be the one to say you were wrong first, even if it's painfully obvious you weren't. My dad is very religious, and in light of all the negativity from her towards him, he's kinda gone a bit crazy with the whole god healed me there are demons in this house kinda thing, and is really acting too elitist, kinda obsessive about it. I guess that's what mental disorders and stress does to you. My mom constantly talks badly about my dad doing all these thing, which I agree, some of the stuff he does is kinda freaky, but she always uses mental disorders as a basis for many of the things she says about him, and claims that her mother is not well, and has mental disorders as well. 

I think that a large part of her problem is not liking being wrong, having anyone think anything differently than her, and being called out on being wrong. The last one is understandable, but she then goes off on you, starts bringing up all these issues above, personal attacks (i'm already super low self esteem anyways, thanks for that), and doesn't listen to anything I say. She also keeps yelling at me that I'm just like my father, and what did he do to brainwash you, completely ignoring the facts I'm telling her. I think that it's her fault that my dad is doing what he is, it is definitely her fault that I don't think highly of myself, and I don't know if/what she has done to my sisters. 

She seems to be the one who gets the ball rolling for massive issues like this, and whenever I tell her that most of what people do in the house is directly related to her, she starts arguing, and yelling at me, as stated above.

Despite her being so outwardly tough, she really cannot take anything anyone throws back at her in an argument. She always starts crying after a fight, and goes to yell-talk angrily to someone else about the fight she just had, mostly my older sister (she's really tolerant), or just cries in her room --loudly so everyone can hear it, and KNOW she's upset. So basically after every fight, she demands sympathy from everyone, despite throwing people down at her feet (not literally) just 5 minutes earlier, and it really angers me as she can expect this double standard, whereas everyone else can't. 

Everyone in the family has gone for therapy, and everyone has gone for individual therapy, except her which I strongly think she needs to do, because I feel she may have some mental disorder as well, just like she's claiming her mom is. When I brought up her going to therapy, she was absolutely shocked that I could suggest that she was not perfect, and was really angry about it, and it's everyone else's fault for not supporting her and cooperating bla bla. This exchange happened about a year ago over texts, because we had just had an argument, and I couldn't be in the house any longer so I took a walk. 

Usually huge blow ups like this happen 1-2 times a month, and it's been a fairly reliable event to look forwards to for the past 6 years. Both my parents fight regularly, usually once per day, sometimes more. It is really stressful, and I really do not want to go to live with either of them, but I need the financial help at the moment, because of being super busy in school (online so i need a pc and internet), and not being able to get a job because I am too busy. 

This is a very unfortunate situation, and I really don't know what to do to make my mom listen to me, and not be constantly stressed about my massive school workload, and the constant pressure on me from my mother.

I wanted to get an outside opinion on what I should do, because no one in the family is being helpful, it's just usually blaming other people for their faults, and I really don't know what to do.

I need an outside opinion, because this is really messing with my mental and physical health, and I really want to just leave, but I know that will be a bad move.

I have a friend who is a pathological liar- in that she lies about absoloutley everything. This is a very big deal to me especially since I’m someone who is very good at reading people even when they are GOOD liars, my friend is not.


She lies about everything: made up stories, how well she does in school, how beautiful everyone thinks she is, how many guys want her, how much her parents love her(aka how much money they give her, how many times shes been scouted for modelling (0 times in real life). It’s so frustrating! It’s to the point where I actually have no idea who she really is as a person, and I bet she doesn’t know either.


Not only does she make stuff up but she exaggerates everything and she just started dating the “worlds most amazing man that she’s totally going to marry.” Let me just say she’s said this about every single guy she’s ever dated. When they break up she proceeds to add them to her “loser list” and bash them endlessly. Every guy she’s ever dated is a total loser according to her that has nothing to offer anyone, and the guy she is dating is god in human form.


To be honest, I kind of want to end the relationship. We live in different cities, about an hour away but she is constantly texting me because I know I’m her only girlfriend. I don’t want to hurt her feelings but I feel like next time I see her I wont be able to take her lies anymore. Anyone have any advice on this situation?

I've done so many things to try to encourage equal chores and it just never works.

I found out a few weeks ago that she has some pretty big issues regarding medication. Essentially, her son (my step-brother) went from abusing adderall, to smoking weed, to using cocaine, and ultimately got kicked out of school and was sent to jail. Because of this she has crazy paranoia about any drugs/medication. From what I have *heard* (and I unfortunately don't know the whole story) she discourages my sister from even using her inhaler, and even tries to stop people from using Tylenol, lest they spiral down the same path her son did.

I've tried to talk to my dad about it, and he did say some things that make me question how much of the above is actually true - but then again I'm sure my dad wouldn't say anything that makes his wife sound like a loon.

Jen has always had anxiety issues but they've been managed well for most of her life. Since before we moved in together I notice her saying and doing things that didn't sit right with me but I just thought she was kind of quirky. 

It mostly started at the beginning of the summer when she said it would be funny if her and I were the same person secretly. She's now mentioned it to me at least 4 times, and I usually laugh it off. She said we're the same person living two halves of a life. She smokes a fair amount of weed so I figured it was just stoner talk. 

She mentioned how she had to stop watching the news because every story was about her. We live in a relatively small city so it's common to see familiar places and faces on the local news. I came home recently and the tv was unplugged and turned around. 


Jen came home really confused last week and asked if I knew anything about license plates on cars. I asked what she meant and she was wondering if people frequently change their license plates, like, do they change daily. I told her no and asked why. She said the same car is always outside our building but the license plate always changes. 


She asked me repeatedly to stop rearranging her closet. I told her I never ever entre her living space. I heard her in her room through the door talking to her mom on the phone. She was saying I wont stop passive aggressively cleaning her room and hanging her clothes differently and she wanted to set up a camera. Again I just think she smoked to much and forgot she did laundry or something. 

So I'm really starting to grow concerned when I notice she has all these print outs left on the table about license plates. Searching license plate info and messages in license plates. It was in a folder with different tabs and dates. There was also a few pictures printed off of cars and one delivery truck that are usually outside our building. I was going to ask her about it when she got home from work but she came to me first. 

She said she didn't feel safe living here with me that I was obviously involved with something with the neighbors to conspire against her and messing with her room and sending pictures of her living space to other people. She said she knew about the cars outside so I could stop playing dumb. I was completely stunned and speechless. I told her we should call her mom but she said she's handling this herself and left the apartment with her folder of info and her purse. 


I texted one of her friends to see if she had contacted them and they said they were glad she left and I was being a huge creep (im gay btw). They questioned why I wanted to know where Jen was and said she was finally safe - away from me. I tried calling her friend but they didn't pick up so I told her whatever Jen said about me probably wasn't true and I thought she had something seriously wrong with her. They didn't respond. I'm freaked out that she has people convinced to spying on her or something.

13965,Non-Romantic,3bohxr,"I have always been a self-made person. Got my first job at 14, moved out without any assistance at 18, rarely ever ask for monetary help from parents or friends unless I'm in truly dire need. I also understand that some people have various circumstances that prevent them from doing the same, so I don't look down on anyone for relying on social programs or living at home a little longer than I did. 

HOWEVER. I have this friend who I've known about a year. (I returned to school finally, after about 7 years of working my butt off and still being broke. She was in one of my classes at community college last year, which is how we met.) She's quite a lot younger than me, maturity-wise and in age. She's a nice person, and we get along fine for the most part, but, she's in a different place than me--still lives at home with her parents, has an allowance instead of a job, etc. (Actually, she's never had a job.) So she's broke a lot, which I understand because I've been there. Not of my own accord, though. I've been broke because rent is expensive and three jobs sometimes still doesn't pay the bills. When I turned 21, I had just signed my first real lease (versus various craigslist rooms I'd had before) on an apartment and was working a full-time job.

So it's never anything major, but I've just noticed this trend with her that irritates the shit out of me and I can't tactfully figure out how to say something without being an asshole. She's just sort of a mooch all the time, and it's starting to really get on my nerves.

For example: My birthday was last weekend, and she came out to my party at a brewery with about 15 other people. She didn't pay for anything and kept asking if I was going to have any leftover food from the sandwich and fries I ordered. She didn't throw in cash on any of the pitchers of beer that people had ordered, either. 

Or like today, I let her tag along to a store I needed to stop by. I was telling her on the drive up there (of course I was driving, she doesn't have a car) about how I'm about to move in with my boyfriend and I was going through my pots and pans because he's already got way nicer kitchen stuff than me, and she immediately says well I'm moving out next year and if you have anything extra then I'd gladly take it off your hands. I told her I already have a friend who lives on her own who is taking everything, and changed the subject. And after the errand, I asked where I could drop her off and she asked to go all the way up to downtown, which is nowhere near my house that I was headed to. I dropped her off at the subway station instead, but I was sort of just irritated that she would even ask me to drive two miles out of my way into the part of the city with the heaviest traffic in the middle of the day just to drop her off at a different subway station.

I mean, I know she's not completely destitute because she has money to buy hair dye and expensive food from Whole Foods. She's also been in community college for over three years without finishing any program, and she doesn't come to class half the time anyway. I mentioned maybe she should move out and she said she was afraid of being homeless. So, I sort of feel like she's either lazy or afraid of succeeding or maybe her parents have convinced her to just stay at home because she's the baby of the family? I don't know. I'm just really irritated and I feel like it's rude to be constantly asking for things because that makes me feel awkward having to say no. 

I do sort of feel like maybe the dynamic between us is a little bit my fault, because I've always been the type of person to help out a friend in need or else I'll just give people things that I don't need anymore. Like, I used to give her the rest of my coffee every morning because I would only drink half of it. I didn't really notice for a while that it turned into her not buying her own coffee anymore, until one morning after I gave it to her she said something like Thanks I was waiting for you to be done with it! I needed some caffeine! 

So how do I say any of this to her without being a total dick about it? I could just stop hanging out with her altogether but that seems a little extreme and I think she just needs an older person to be like dude, you're being a mooch, knock it off.

Her and I get along very well normally, but there are a few habits of hers(which I think are unlikely to change) that I cannot live with anymore. Namely the fact that at least 4 days a week she cries for at least an hour a day(usually 3+), as I'm trying to sleep. As a freshman in the dorms usually switching dorms causes for a long extensive process of trying meet together and make schedules and change things. But I've managed to work around that due do how long this has been going on (she was supposed to transfer schools...then didn't) and a little parental involvement(which I didn't want...but they went to the administrator due to how upset I have been). 

Now, I'm probably moving to another dorm room, but I know I can't just move out without telling her that I am. How exactly should I go about doing this? I don't want to make her feel too bad about it, especially because I consider her a friend, just not one I can live with. I tried last semester and between her and the DJ on the other side of my wall I had anxiety attacks every time I had to return to school from my house.

My SO has been in a start up company for over 5 years now. It's a company that makes software for guardhouses in gated communities (the program basically shows who comes in and out of the community/grants access or denies it/opens the gate). This start up company only has like 3 people working in it this entire time. My SO who is a computer programmer, his boss which also programs the software, the some other dude who deals with clients or something.

Their company is doing horribly. When they first started up my SO told me how it's going to be so great and they are going to make a ton of money and how all these communities want their program, but over 5 years later, business SUCKS and nobody wants their program anymore so the boss has decided to drop the program they worked on FOR YEARS all together and get into partnering up with a gate arms business.

My SO is suppose to get paid every 2 weeks, over 2k, but the boss constantly says he can't pay him because The checks haven't came in yet I'll give you a $100 now and try to pay you by the end of the week, by the time he actually pays my SO he owes him way more money than he's giving him because the pay time frames are overlapping and my SO just **DOES NOT care.** I tell him how it's unacceptable for a boss to pay his employees late and if he can't pay his employees, he shouldn't be in a business and all my SO says is If he doesn't have the money he doesn't have the money. I can't tell him to give me something he doesn't have. He doesn't have money either. I need to get my work done so he can bill so and so and I can get my money.

He works like 24/7 from home, he works constantly, and there is **zero** payoff. He's an excellent programmer and programmers half as good as him are making millions of dollars doing what they do and he's making almost nothing.

All his family and friends are telling him that he is wasting his potential and to back out of the business but he refuses, saying Soon I'll stop working so much because we'll have money to hire other people. I just need to work so I can get to that point.......he's said that the entire time he's been in this company. Each year he says the same thing.

My SO is a pushover so there is no way he would tell his boss off or say that it's unacceptable that he doesn't get paid on time. I tell my SO You're lucky we have no kids, because the way you get paid now is unacceptable, you need STABLE money coming in, not just random payments when it's available.

He doesn't even have anything else lined up if the business actually tanks and the boss decides to go off and do something else. The boss himself has said to my SO I know I don't pay you enough and I feel bad about it, you're a good employee for sticking with me. So the boss himself knows it's not fair.

I don't know what to do anymore.

14004,Non-Romantic,1ocelr,"This is big, the backstory is long. I've included some of the chat that was said to me that is bothering me. I feel disgusted and really disturbed by things that are said.

I will be updating/editing things if they look like a mess.


**BACKSTORY**


I work in a very easy going, small store. The environment is great, people are incredibly opened minded. We all get along, and we love to tease each other. It's predominately male, there are about 10 guys in my area and 2 girls including myself. My boss and I have got on great, he's about 30 and has specified he is bisexual.


I'm dating a guy (1 year or so together) who works in another department of our small store. He's 26, we live together and he also gets along with everyone. **He is called Frenchie at times and often teased about his disgust at the mention of rimjobs. (someone brought it up at work and he was mystified and disgusted)**


Recently we've had a few new younger employees hired. 18 years old, younger boys. My boss has sort of taken one under his wing (they both relate in the sense of families disowning them due to religious reasons) and they've become good friends. Younger boy started going over to bosses place... Boss came in one of the days he doesn't work Well (younger coworker) forgot his phone at my place and I brought it for him is what he said, and all sorts of those kind of things started happening.


It wouldn't bother me except for the fact this man is 30 and this boy is fresh out of high school. Also in the work place, younger boy is now hanging out in bosses office 75% of the time and not actually working and others have to pick up on the slack. He is only being treated as a friend and not an employee. This has been brought to attention by a few people and brushed aside as he's scared of other boss so he comes into my office to ask questions. Me and a coworker teased him about being creepy, he got pissed and told us to stop.


Except I was actually being creeped out by this - aged difference is big, it's weird and just seems very sketchy.


**done backstory**


ANYWAYS, here comes the part that's REALLY bothering me.


I Skype with coworkers after work and play League of Legends (communication intensive online video game) and my boss would commonly be in the Skype calls. He would like to bug me along with other coworkers (to the point it pisses me off and I no longer do calls with them) about small things that bother me such as burping A LOT in the call, saying something serious about the game and they would use it out of context and mock me. Well, today they call me (repeatedly) while I was in another call, so I answered briefly to ask them what they want.


Random new person in the call - boss said it's his new found friend and he really likes him. Let's call him Creepy Guy - so Creepy Guy starts asking me about all my reddit posts and links me to a photo I posted about 2 years back. There would be no way he could know what my reddit account was unless my boss gave it to him (he sees my posts in our local city subreddit a fair bit).


This guy says in the chat - 


*Babe. I'd love to take you out to dinner tomorrow night. Wear something revealing. Don't tell Frenchie. I'd muck that bin ;)*


Another chimes in *that means he wouldn't mind your bumhole* (this is the guy who was my friend!)


I told them to stop telling this guy to say creepy things - I imagine they put him up to it to piss me off. I also brought up how if he keeps bothering me like this outside of work, I'd bring it up with BIG BOSSMAN who owns the store we work at. (Which honestly, not much would come of it because it's such a small place)


**Boss -** Uh
So you are going to talk to BOSSMAN
About a dude
That isn't me
Who is bugging you in Skype
Good luck with that


I said, it's getting weird and to please stop. This was going too far.


**Creepy guy -** You have great breeding hips. I would drink your bathwater to have 20 minutes in the same room as you.


**Boss -** Hey
I just met this guy
He's awesome
But still


I told them to keep me out of this.


**Creepy guy -** 
Nah. Boss told me there's this 20/21 year old girl who's my type


**Boss -**
Truth


SO HE'S TELLING RANDOM GUYS ABOUT ME? WTF.

I heard Frenchie doesn't like ass. Don't want him to stick his tongue down there?


When I stopped responding


**Creepy guy-**
Hey babe
why wont u talk to me :,(


I started ignoring them after this and messaged a friend asking what would be the best way to go about this. Now posting this.


I honestly have no idea what to do -take boss aside and talk to him about this? Or BIGBOSS about this? I made it clear in calls/messages that I didn't want to be apart of their conversations and didn't want to be creeped on. I'm not gung-ho on leaving my job because I make good pay (no schooling at the moment) and I enjoy everything else about it.

14011,Non-Romantic,3es2po,"I'm an MA student living in Sydney and my flatmate is a guy from California also doing the program. We get along really well so it's not awkward thankfully and we're good friends so it's nice. But our apartment is pretty smile. 

He wants to bring over his family (parents and three sisters) for Christmas and have them stay with us so it is affordable and it is his last Christmas here as he will be finishing the program in June next year. They're thinking the 2 weeks over Christmas/New Year. That way they get their summer christmas, can go to the harbour bridge for New Year's Eve, it's a nice experience for everyone. 

So I don't really want to begrudge him bringing his family over, but I ALSO don't fancy the idea of having five people in my apartment who aren't really 'my' guests, especially because Australia is very hot over Christmas and the air conditioning is only in the bedrooms, so he's said he can just get a couple of blow up mattresses and put his sisters in with me and give his parents his room and he'll take the living room which gets really hot 'and you don't mind right? You'll all get along'. 

Now, I'm sure they are perfectly nice girls but...the idea of having to share my living space with 3 other people for 2 or so weeks seems pretty....unfair to me? I don't want to begrudge them getting to come to Australia BUT it's a pretty big inconvenience to me to not be able to shower/sleep/bathroom on demand and as an introvert, having people around me all the time and having to be 'on' iykwim. I like to come into my room for peace and quiet. It is my living space and I am paying for it. 

So I'm considering going for a holiday. I can afford it by using my tax refund and I've been meaning to get out and travel a bit anyway. I was thinking of going over to London and visiting my friend who is doing a working holiday there (she has a full spare room/bathroom she has offered to stay in, so a bit less of an imposition on someone) for a week, maybe treat her to a day in Paris as a thank you, and then maybe off to Amsterdam for 3 days to visit a long term (as in, 8 years) fandom friend who has invited me to visit her. That way they can have the space and I don't have to be there for it. 

I'm not expecting them to pay for any of that....but is it far to perhaps ask for him/his family to cover my share of the rent/bills while I'm gone? I sort of feel like it's a bit unfair to have to pay for the rent of my room which his family is using it and I've sort of been 'driven out' of the room and things like utilities will go up with 5 extra people there and my rent is $300 a week because INNER SYDNEY so you know, that's $600 or so I'm paying for a room I've been driven out of in a way? 

If this is fair, how can I phrase it to ask?

So here goes. 

I have been friends with Amber for 8 years. We have been living together for three of those years. We have since graduated from college and are both in the same field (teaching.) 

Amber and I have always had a lot in common. We were both overweight, we didn't have a lot of luck with guys, liked the same movies/TV shows. We even had similar decorating styles. We would share clothes and act like sisters, as we are both only children. 

The issues began about six months ago. Amber's parents [56f/60m] paid off her student loans (in full) as a congratulations for working so hard. And Amber did work hard, but it hurt to see her be able to finally do adult things when my parents pretty much didn't give a crap about me. I kept it to myself, because it was a childish view to have. I understand my issues should not be her issues. But seeing her able to go out more and being unable to do the same made me feel like shit. 

Amber quit her job because she had money saved up. She then joined a gym and has lost close to 40lbs in the last six months. She looks amazing and I was really happy for her. She even offered to help out more with rent, which I was so thankful for. But it doesn't take away the sting of jealousy. We were always able to relate so well to one another and now I feel left behind. She gave me all her old clothes and now we can only share shoes. Even then, she has started telling me she doesn't want to share clothes anymore because she has bought nice work clothes and doesn't want to shoes getting scuffed. 

She has a boyfriend now and he is over twice a week. He always helps out, makes enough food for all of us, doesn't make a mess. I should be happy that she has all these great things going on for her... but I am miserable. Now I feel like I don't have anyone. She is busy making new friends, she got a job offer she can take because she doesn't have money issues, she is happier. 

I have tried not to bring it up at all, but she has started to notice I no longer want to watch the same shows with her... because her boyfriend is in the same room as us. 

I work a horrible job, to pay for a roof over my head, and I am so fucking unhappy I don't know how to think straight. My parents didn't come to my graduation, but Amber's did. My birthday was two days ago. Amber remembered, but no one else did. It just made me realize how much of a loser I am. 

We have 5 more months on the lease, but I am not sure what I am going to do after that. 

I just have such a bitter hatred for life and I am turning it on Amber. I don't want to feel like she is someone I should hate. That is wrong. I just don't know how else to deal with it. Everyone says Amber is the life of the party now. 

Her boyfriend [26m] has told me he noticed how angry I sometimes get when Amber tells him something good happened and he wants it to stop.

Here is the super long back story:
Let's say my mom's name is Jane and my dad's name is John. Jane and I have had a really rocky relationship the past 10 years or so, it started with her beginning to drink for fun. She was the type of drunk that had a hatred and attitude towards everything in life, always treating our family like crap. That never went well with me, so I basically halted spending time with her and hung out with my dad or friends instead. This continued for a few years until our family was absolutely done with it, she promises she will quit, and she does! YAY! Everyone is happy, she turns into someone I actually like to talk to every now and then, we end up losing our home because we can't afford to pay the house payment and then we begin the shuffle of moving house to house just about every year or so (the moving continues throughout the whole story, so I won't bother mentioning it again except for this one situation). Eventually we had to move in with her mother whom my mom has an extremely horrible relationship with, I won't go into details because that would be a story in it's own... My grandmother never really favored us, she always preferred her other daughter and their family, who happen to be the rich show offy type. Let's just say there was always tension living with my grandmother.


2010 now, John's health starts showing some scary signs. He ends up in the hospital a few times throughout the year from seizure-like fainting episodes. Doctor, after doctor, after doctor... No one could figure out why he was having this problem! This begins testing my moms nerves... About a year later I then start to develop medical issues of my own that puts me in the hospital as well. I probably visited the hospital about once every month or so. Only adding to my moms stress. I went through the same situation my dad went through, no one can figure what's wrong... I should probably mention that the bills are wracking up at this point, $100 every hospital visit, $20-60 every doctor visit, I won't even go into the insurance bill prices... 2012, my dad ends up getting surgery to put a loop recorder in his chest. He was the first person there to get this procedure and what a first it was...Surgeon didn't fully close the incision so the actual device was literally falling out and getting the surrounding area super infect. He is put back in the hospital to take it out as soon as we noticed something was up. Jane and I are going insane at this point, worried for our loved one.... Not even 4 months later, I figure out what has been putting me in the hospital... Hello endometriosis, now please go away, forever. November 2012, I'm put in the hospital for my very first ever surgery of any kind. There was so much stress in the household at this point that we all just wanted everything to stop and go back to the way things were.


In the midst of 2012 Jane happens to get a new job. Ends up making some friends and going out to lunch with the coworkers...Turns out every time she went to lunch with them, they would have some crazy alcoholic drinks. Which of course gets me concerned, so I end up trying to avoid saying that I hope she doesn't get hooked on it again (anything to do with being considered a drunk fuels her fire) by saying that she shouldn't be drinking when she has to go back to work the next minute. She continues to have her daily drink with the girls, pretending nothing is going to happen...


Fast foward to 2013, I start dating this amazing guy, whom happens to live 2,000 miles away. Excited as I am about the situation, I go and tell my parents. It didn't go well with Jane to say the least... Shortly after the news, Jane began drinking heavily at home. I, of course get livid by the fact that she just wanted to throw all her years of determination at being sober. She later starts accusing me for her drinking... We start to begin our rocky relationship ONCE again. Starting to butt heads quite often regarding her drinking..


Throughout 2013-2015 Jane's drinking progresses from 3-5 beers a day to 8 beers a day and even more on the weekend... We're not the best off money wise and health wise still, living paycheck to paycheck, sometimes having to borrow money to pay bills. Having her buy 6 packs of beer plus some every day really adds up after a while, so I start mentioning that it's an expensive habit that she should try to slow down on. You could see the fire building in her eyes... Ended with her being over-dramatic and storming off, throwing everything she could around the room while yelling every horrible word she could think of at me. John and I both agree that Jane should quit. Whenever we mention that she's getting too wild with her drinking she claims we're ganging up on her and don't love her. Lately Jane has been getting the nerve to go out driving while drunk, and trying to force me to drive her around while she has an open beer in hand...


Tonight was a different kind of night, it started the usual way, Jane chugging drinks left and right. Out of the blue she starts getting annoyed with my dads health (yes, he's still having issues) and kept bringing up the fact that John was, as she calls it, flirting with the nurses at his last hospital visit. Which he wasn't, she just wants an excuse to complain about him. They end up going to the bedroom, I continue on through the night playing a video game. Not even 10 minutes later, I take my headphones off and happen to notice my mom saying all kinds of weird things, I peep out of my room to hear it a little better. Apparently Jane is furious that everything revolves around John and that no thinks about her, and that she's tired of everything. John walks out the room trying to avoid arguing with her. As most people know arguing does nothing with a drunk person. Seconds later I see Jane walk out and chase after him. All I could hear was her cursing at him non stop about him not ever feeling well and that he should not be so nice to nurses and should live at the hospital since he likes it so much. Which might I add, he is as terrified of hospitals like I am so there is no liking it here... I intervene telling her to chill out and that she should just go to bed because she's being mean to him for no reason. Jane tells me to stay out of it, I of course stick up for John and continue on my end. I mention she should go to sleep, that it's not a good idea to argue over nothing. She storms off to the room, comes back and gets in my face, spitting and cursing me out saying how I don't know what it's like living with two people who constantly have issues and that I don't know how hard it is living like she does, she goes on to mention random rude things about me. I'm on the rather soft side so I start crying and go off into my room and shut the door. Jane then begins to lash out at John. 


...That's when I hear John yelling PUT THE KNIFE DOWN, STOP YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, STOP IT HONEY. I completely freak out and rush out to stop whatever is happening, only to notice John taking a knife away from Jane and putting it back up. I freak out thinking she was trying to stab him, having a panic attack the second I seen the knife. Everyone freaks out even more, I try to figure out what just happened after I come back to reality. Turns out Jane wanted to kill herself in front of John. She begins attempting to console me by constantly saying she thinks it would be easier to slit her own wrists than deal with all this stress, since it's too much for her. That just made me burst into tears knowing she's suicidal now, and possibly might hurt another. Even though she ended the night by pinky promising me she won't hurt anyone or herself, I don't trust her. John finally got Jane to go to bed.. but I'm at a loss for words. I'm sitting here stressed, crying, scared for my life. Jane was willing to pull a knife out because of an argument.. Who knows what might happen next. What should I do....?

   
TL;DR: My mom deals with a lot of stress so she drowns herself in beer to avoid having to deal with any of it.

He sent me vile messages detailing what she does in the bedroom and what her duty in the bedroom should be ( his world revolves around sex) he used to watch porn on his laptop when we were all sitting my the living room with him. 


Anyway, I ramble alot so long story short he started sending vile messages about his sex life with my mum, my mums mental state (depression) and my sex life (which he knows nothing about as I don't publicise any info) I was outraged at this, more so because my mum said nothing, she never confronted him once she saw the messages he sent. He says he's a victim in all this because he didn't get enough TLC from her(mum) I had went no contact with him in the summer after his messages

On to today, she had informed me that he  has sent Christmas gifts for my children, I'm still disgusted as he never once apologised for the vile things he said and is likely never to. I had thought long and hard about it /spoke to my husband[m/30] and have told her that she is not to give those gifts to my children ( she has a tendency to undermine my parenting choices)  I let her know I'm still angry and disgusted and don't want someone like that in my children's (3 under 5 years old) lives and I won't let him think that if he sends gifts that things will be smoothed over and he will be welcome back with open arms. 


I suppose the advice I need is do I leave it to my mum to let him know what I've requested, knowing that in all likelyhood she will tell him that my kids loved the gifts/try and gift them to them when she thinks I've forgotten (she enables his behaviour) or should I email him letting him know that he should respect my wishes to not contact myself or my children, be it with presents or with messages through my mum, keeping in mind if I email him he will start drama with my mum. However I'm not too scared to set them all straight and tell them how it is.

14042,Non-Romantic,2mq35r,"So it all started about a year ago when a co-worker of mine [20 M] and I [20 M] started to talk a lot outside of work. We always got along at work but we started having deep and meaningful conversations outside of work, via text message. 

 So in May he crashed his car pretty bad, it was totaled, and he was freaking out and depressed and didn't know what to do. I offered to give him a ride and he paid me cash weekly. It worked perfect for us because he only lived 15 minutes from me and it close to where we both worked. 
    
So he crashed his car in May and I have continued to give him a ride up until today. He pays me 200 a month which Is fair compensation for the drive and time. So since we spent so much time together we became really close and I started staying over at his house and he at mine. I met his parents and they liked me and my parents loved him. We became best friends and spend basically every day together throughout the summer. 
      
He had a girlfriend [19 F] at the time. I am straight and single but I have many girls whom which I regularly hang out with. His girlfriend and I became close and started texting and talking behind his back. I didn't think anything of it. We never did anything, never kissed, or had sex, or even touched one another. We had this understanding. But, over the summer we all (my friend, his GF, one of her friends, and I) went to concert in the city, and I got extremely drunk. I told his GF that I loved her that day and ever since then my friend never trusted that her or I would never do anything. 
     
So come fall, I being a sophomore in a local college was getting ready to go back and I wasn't doing so good. I had a 2.3 GPA and I knew I wouldn't do much better this semester. So I made the decision to go to a local community college. My decision was based equally in the two facts that I wasn't doing so well and my friend was also going there. We planned it all out and enrolled and had a great plan to go to the local community college together then transfer to a better school. We made plans to basically be best friends for a long time and we really got along.
     
So my greatest mistake came just after school started, it was his girlfriends birthday. I have a female best friend named Sara who had always told me she would love to go zip lining. Me, being scared and not wanting to seem like a coward decided to go once before I took her just to not seem inexperienced and foolish when i went with her. I didn't want to go alone and the idea popped into my head to take my friends GF partly because it was just her birthday a week ago. We knew that my friend would not like us going and we should have respected that, but we didn't tell him. 
     
This is the main sticking point to his hatred towards me, when he found out he didn't freak out or tell or try and punch me. He didn't say anything for a month, at least to me. He told me he felt betrayed and how could any true friend of mine have done what you did and not tell me. He has every reason to hate me and I absolutely feel terrible for doing it. This combined with what I said when I was drunk drove him to make accusations about what her and I actually did. I don't know If he actually thinks her and I did anything but we didn't. 
     
We went through that month after he found out barely speaking in the car, keep in mind I still drive him every day, and walking mostly silently between classes. Our school schedules and work schedules are the same and we see each other everyday. 
     
About a month ago, he began cheating on his girlfriend with a girl he said he has known a while. This girl would pick him up from school or work sometimes, so I obviously knew when they were together. His girlfriend and mother called me one night and asked where he was. I told them that I didn't drive him home and in that moment all thoughts about the possibility of cheating became a reality. His girlfriend freaked out and broke it off (they were together 2 years) and I still to this day feel guilty. 
     
2 weeks ago he got drunk before I drove him home and we talked a little in the car, and he told me I was 100 percent the reason he was not with his girlfriend anymore and he the only solace he has was that because she is gone he had this new amazing girl in his life. He basically told me I am completely reason he ended a 2 year relationship an he was glad because this new girl, who I publicly called a whore, was back in his life. 

I honestly love this kid like a brother, we became so close of such a short period of time and I ruined what would have been a great future. I don't know how to begin dealing with this and especially seeing him everyday. He has mentioned changing majors and just the thought of not having him in my life anymore makes me so sad. I just want things to be like they used  to but I know that can never happen. He has basically told me that he doesn't care about me and he will get a car as soon as he has enough money. I know It sounds like he I just using me now, and maybe that's true but I can't just kick him out especially after what I did.

14049,Non-Romantic,2u0gtl,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible and try not to ramble. Sorry for any typos/errors. Quickly typing this before I head off to work. My uncle moved in with my parents in December and I'm concerned about the impact this has on my family. My father is ill with chronic pancreatitis, which started with a severe pancreatic attack about 4 years ago. Most people get over pancreatitis, but he had a severe enough attack to cause permanent nerve damage and damage to his pancreas. Because of this, he is in pain daily and is on a lot of medication to manage that pain. He is no longer able to work, so my mother is the primary source of income. She doesn't make a ton of money and is now caring for my father and my brother, who is about to graduate high school in the summer and begin college in the fall. I live about 3 miles from my parents and try to visit and help them with things as much as possible. 

This last year, my uncle (my mom's brother) went through a divorce and lost custody of his two daughter's. This was obviously devastating to him and he was in a really tough place. Because of possible dementia (waiting to get this confirmed), he has also been out of work for years. He lived in a different state, and my mom offered to have him come stay with my parents for the holidays (just for the month of December), so he could be around family. About two weeks into his stay, he declared to my parents that he was thinking of moving in (without asking my parents). My mom has a total soft spot for him, and said yes. 

We had an idea that he had something going on with him, as his behavior has changed a lot over the last few years. We think it may be dementia and he's going to the doctor soon to confirm this, but we  have a lot of different things that run in our family (dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar, etc.) My uncle, for one, is extremely paranoid and makes comments about the government being out to get him. He also can't remember simple things like the name of my mom's dog, the email password that he uses every day, where the silverware drawer is, etc. Some days he seems a little more with it, but most of the time he seems spacey and forgetful. When we bring up these concerns, he makes comments like I don't remember the name of my email password because I have more important things to remember and I don't want to waste my memory on small things. 

He also has moments where he gets aggressive. Like when he can't get ahold of his children, he'll yell at people on the phone, or get aggressive about filing his taxes.

One of my concerns is that my family does not have the finances to take care of another adult at the moment. There is only one source of income and my dad has medical bills and my parents plan on helping my brother some with his first few years of college. I'm also concerned about his aggressive behavior. My grandmother (my uncle and mom's mother) has dementia and had it at a young age and started becoming very aggressive with others. I worry about my mother or brother being alone with him, as he's a pretty big guy and could easily overpower them. 

I understand that my mom cares for him and wants to be there for him, but with my father being ill and with my parents struggling financially, I don't know if my family should be helping him right now. My father is home all day because he's ill and ends up watching my uncle a lot and I feel that that's unfair to him because he's already dealing with a lot of physical pain. He feels like he's having to babysit him. There also isn't really a plan for the future with my uncle. Because of his possible dementia, he's unable to work and is staying with my family for an indefinite amount of time. My father has expressed how stressed this makes him and that he fears it will be harmful to his marriage to my mom. Whenever my father and I express concerns to my mother about this, she becomes very defensive and says that she can't abandon him because he's her brother. I understand where she's coming from, and I think he does need support right now, but I feel like this is harmful to my family and I'm not sure what else they can do. 

I'm sure there are things I'm leaving out, so feel free to ask questions. I guess I'm just looking for advice. Is there another way we could support him that is less of a burden on my parents? Is my mom in the right here?

14051,Non-Romantic,28z9av,"Hi reddit!

I'm an Austrian girl currently finishing high school, he's an American soldier stationed in Germany. We met on OKCupid half a year ago due to sheer coincidence and have been inseparable ever since. 
My life was pretty shitty so far - you could say it only really started after I met him. His was equal, so he understands why I'm sometimes a bit strange. He even waited for almost a week for me to return when I'd attempted suicide and back then we'd only been talking for a week. All in all, I can say that even with my inexperience and maybe naïveté, I have never made a choice more determinedly and happily than when I said 'Yes' to his proposal.

Now, my family and friends all support me in my decision - all but my grandmother, the woman who raised me and gave me a chance at becoming a decent person. I'm always going to be grateful to her and will always look up to her, but with her reaction to my engagement and my plans, she has hurt me very deeply.

Basically, I told her the situation as it is, that we're getting married to be able to live together and go to the States in two years (something I would've done eventually anyway, I was not made to stay here), we want to give it a shot and he wants to be able to support me in every way possible, especially given how anxious I am about all this 'grown-up stuff' sometimes. We agree on financial matters and well as when it comes to working and living, or familial things. I told him that I would not agree to marry him if we didn't discuss certain things and he gave me some reason other than 'I want to get out of the barracks' and he did both things in a way that left no need for doubts or worries.

My grandmother's reaction was skeptical, negative and downright insulting. Summarized, she believes he will not allow me to get a college degree, work, or follow my dreams and that I will horribly regret this. For some reason, she compares me to my mother, who has the uncanny ability to get every man to become angry and do things unlike them, thinking I will be thrown out and end up on the streets.
She didn't even have the courtesy to congratulate me.

My fiancè was here for a visit last week and I did not feel any need to introduce them, as she dismissed him before ever meeting him in person and makes him out to be some kind of villain, which he is really not. 

I know I am young and it might seem dumb, but I want to do my best and just give it a try, because things could always go wrong, no matter whether married or not or how old the people involved are. This was more of a vent, but I'd also like to ask you redditors for your opinions, as the more angles I get to view this from, the more justified and prepared do I feel in the end.

The actual issues is my brother and I never had a strong relationship. We argue a lot, sometimes physical. When I give him a attitude, he would hit me in my kidney. As someone with kidney and bladder disease, it really hurts. I admit I did hurt him a lot when I was younger but this isn't acceptable, he's in his 20's. 


He and I have a opposite point of view in life. He's very anti-social, I'm very sociable. He's book-smart while I'm street-smart. He goes to University in different city and I'm attending local trade school. He got this snobby attitude while I'm the one who would always smile. He absolutely hates kids, I absolutely love kids. I want marriage/children in the future. He's not interested in any of that. He absolutely don't like relationship and see it pointless. He hates most of people, regardless what the gender is.

I'm tired of get hurt occasionally. He insults me alot. He called me fat-pig, ugly, and dumb when we was younger which led me to have a body image issues.

When he saw my old self-harm on my leg, his only comment was Don't be a retarded emo



I told my mom a lot that I want to bail on him but my mom told me not to be selfish because he's my family. Honestly, at this point, I don't care if I'm selfish. I'm tired of it and I want to put end to our relationship. He hates all of my friends even the good one. He have friends himself but he hates all of them and he only hangs with me when I'm around. I know one thing for sure is when I have kids, he may won't be allowed near them. I'm scared of him hurting them. When time is good, he will be nicest brother and we get along which is rare. When we argue, it's usually the worse one. When I tell him to stop, he will tell me to stop playing the victim. 



I have a boyfriend (20?/M) who treats me so much better than my brother does. My dad (50's/M) even treats me better. When my dad and I disagree on something, we don't argue. That goes same for my boyfriend and I, we solve on the issue and move on. They let me do and eat whatever I want. I have other brother (30's/M) but the father took him away after my mom gave birth to him.


My brother had a girlfriend for two years and no physical abuse was ever there. He never talked about her but I attended same school as her.. She's absolutely gorgeous and hilarious. They never argued. They broke up due to mutual feeling.  I'm only one who gets hurt (physically and emotionally) by him. But as older we get, the less he do it. He shows our mom a lot of respect, just not me.

I've met his family and spent Christmas there and they have been completely lovely to me. He hasn't met my family. They live a fair drive away from us, and the trip would require spending one or more nights. I haven't been to see them in nearly 2 years, and we rarely speak. Sadly, my mom is an alcoholic and very much in denial. She can also be a...difficult person to deal with sometimes, and has some mental health issues (paging r/raisedbynarcissists). My dad has been long separated from her and has his own history of alcohol abuse, but he has controlled this in recent years and I don't expect it to be an issue during the visit.

She's mainly harmless, and during the day most things are normal, but will almost guaranteed to have been drinking by the time we arrive in the evening and will be tipsy. It hurts me not to be able to help these people, but I've long ago found ways to cope (mainly by keeping my distance).

Brief history - boyfriend and I were long distance for a little bit after uni. I managed to get a job near him, it was thought I would live with him and his parents for a couple of months and then we would move into out own place. I have a cat. She is currently being looked after by my parents (I pay for everything) as my boyfriends family has a dog large bouncy dog who's only interaction with cats is to bark and chase them out the garden. I did ask them if they were okay with that, and they were also the ones pushing me to find a job near my BF as it made sense.

There's a lot of stuff I could tell you about my parents but it's really hard to explain and would take too long, so I'll leave it out for now.

Unfortunately it's taken longer than expected, it's been like 7/8 months instead of 3/4. Money isn't the issue, more at the moment things are going really quickly and due to our different shifts we can only view places are certain times etc. The two houses we went for previously, both by private landlords were given to other people. It's frustrating, I'm really stressed out it. I've talked to my boyfriend about it, it's shit.

Onto my parents, mainly my mum I think but my dad always backs her up. She's annoyed that it's taking to long. Every time I see her she brings it up with this tone. And the last time I saw her she said I would have to find an 'alternative' place to keep my cat. Recently she messaged me saying perhaps we should up our rent budget to one we previously looked at but realised we could barely afford. And seeing as this is all new to us we don't want to rent somewhere we might actually find is too much. Again she brings up my cat, I say that if it comes to it someone else will look after her up here, as I spoke to my bf about what she had said. I explain about rent, she says that instead of resolving the issue by seriously looking for a place to rent i'm opting to palm her off on someone else, and my poor cat, how she won't like it, and she wonders how long someone else would be willing to look after her for. all ive said since is to reiterate about the rent being too much and that it's preferable to selling her/giving her away to someone unknown. So far i've heard nothing from her but I'm expecting to hear soon.

Trouble is I don't know what to say or do? Am I really in the wrong here? I don't know. She's gonna be so mad and she's making me feel so bad that I'm a horrible cat owner/daughter

My mom died from cancer two years ago, a year and a half after diagnosis. They called it terminal from the very start and she actually had a lot more time than her doctors were expecting, but this shit is always hard to deal with. My dad refused to believe it at first, but then became utterly obsessed with finding her a cure, first through medicine and then, when he became frustrated with palliative chemo that just seemed to make her more miserable, religion.

He kind of went off the deep end with it--he would anoint her in oil, had holy water shipped over from Israel, filled the books with dense religious tomes and spent his time in deep prayer and meditation. His job performance suffered. He interfered with her treatment, taking her off medicine with potentially deadly withdrawal symptoms. When she finally died (ironically while getting ready for an appointment with her cardiologist--surprise, don't need to see him anymore) I was almost relieved. Maybe now things could go back to normal. I had already lost my mother and pretty much my best friend, but maybe I could get my dad back.

No such luck. Four months later his job offered him a buyout and he took it. I had already made plans to move out of state to pursue my dream career... and I did the selfish thing and left anyway. Now I'm six months into an entry-level job doing what I love, but it's highly region-specific and I would have a difficult time finding something back home. 

A year and a half later, he's still out of work, but he's spending like crazy. He had always had a problem with overdrafting his checking accounts and running up credit card bills but Mom was there to rein him in, albeit through stressful arguments. He's bought literally hundreds of books, bookbinding equipment, a piano, a wine rack and hundreds of dollars worth of wine to fill it decoratively. He had bought an RV shortly before Mom died--hasn't sold it, has in fact sunk gobs of money into refurbishing it. It hasn't gone farther than the repair shop. He still has her old car, the SUV they leased for roadtrips, and his old car, and probably won't sell or give up any of them. Now his obsession is cuckoo clocks and grandfather clocks--it's been maybe two months and he already has five. He's not going to have enough money for his retirement if he keeps blowing through it, and I am in a career of passion, not cash.

My mom's youngest brother and mother are living in the house, and had been for a while before the cancer, but my uncle and my dad had never gotten along and Uncle had actually gotten together the down payment for a house for the two of them before a road accident put him out of commission. He's fine, but he's fighting with the insurance company to cover one of his surgeries and shit ain't cheap. And my grandmother? She gets along better but she'd feel guilty leaving him, so she'd take some convincing. I'm an only child and they're his only relatives in the area--everyone else is several states away, and they're pretty much all estranged.

But I don't think he's healthy to be around, especially for her--he's gotten as many as fifteen packages delivered in one day and tends to just leave them piled around the house for someone else to deal with. Grandma is in her eighties and has already broken one hip--I'm terrified she's going to fall again. He never cleans the house, and it's huge--five bedrooms, four baths, and he probably hasn't cleaned my old bathroom since I scrubbed it down the last time I came and visited, last Christmas. She can only do so much, and I know if I had stayed I would have had to step right into my mother's shoes as caretaker for everyone. I was 22 and just wanted to have a life, a career, something other than taking people to the doctor's office and paying bills and scrubbing the floor while working a dead-end retail job.

Dad's apparently been internet-dating and has been for a while, but he's... probably not in the best position to be doing that. He's extremely self-righteous, both intensely religious and vehemently Democratic. The cop in Ferguson was a devil. Obamacare is perfect. All Republicans, not some, not even many, are selfish, evil, stupid. He will not entertain opinions that conflict with his own, and in fact views people he disagrees with as unfortunate imbeciles or actively malignant and does not hesitate to cut them off. I love him, but if I was a single woman in his peer group, I'd run the fuck away. He's gotten frustrated and had wiped his hands of the whole thing, except for one Chinese dating site through which he met this woman from Tibet. She teaches English but I have been cautioned to not expect perfect grammar. She has a shy daughter four years younger than I am. She is beautiful, inside and out, like my mother is--he still speaks of her in the present tense. He's debating a trip to Tibet to visit her.

Except he just sent me an email with staged-looking pictures of this woman. Her email address returns zero google hits, the images don't pull up anything on Tineye or image search, but my bullshit detector is screaming at me that this is a scam. He closed the email with a paragraph that suggest to me his ultimate goal is to have her move into his house--he wanted to make sure we could all live together in [his] house comfortably. He had told me he'd met her only a few months ago.

So we have a lonely widower with liquid retirement assets he's willing to spend. He's an extraordinarily intelligent man, but my mother had all the common sense in the relationship. He is not open to people challenging his viewpoints--at all. He is extraordinarily stubborn. People at support groups are idiots. Therapists are idiots. I've avoided becoming an idiot because I am his daughter and liberal enough that I can follow along with his tirades without too much difficulty, but how the fuck do I help him? How do I warn him that there are serious red flags here? How do I address the larger way his life has gone to shit without giving up my own life, my job, my boyfriend? Should I approach this woman? I have her email address. What would I even say? Hello, nice to meet you, if you're planning on hurting my father I will shank you like a bitch and feed your organmeat to the animals. I hope we can enjoy a pleasant relationship, New-Mom and New-Sister!

Our friendship has always caused problems in his romantic relationships.  His girlfriends have generally been suspicious of me. I usually bend over backwards to be friendly and convince them I'm not interested in him beyond friendship and I'm not trying to fight for his affection or play games. 


Honestly, it got old having to work so hard to get these jealous girls to calm down and see me for who I really am.  So with his most recent girlfriend, I didn't try that hard.  She's very prissy, into traditional gender roles, reads cosmopolitan. He has always been into more alternative tough chicks. I didn't think it would last. And they did break up for a while, she moved out of the country, but then came back and surprisingly, they got back together. Then quickly got married.


She needed a green card and he wanted her to stay, so he married her. He didn't talk to me or any of our other friends or family before he did it. But I know he wants a family and she will be a good mother.


So they did the courthouse wedding this winter, and now they're having a ceremony and reception in a couple months. I didn't even think about the wedding party until I went to their website to RSVP and saw a link.  And saw that they each have 10 standing up on their side. I wasn't asked and he couldn't even tell me to my face, I had to find out on the fucking website.


I'm devastated. I could get over a simple snub, and I know how stressful wedding planning can be. I'm also recently married and I didn't have a wedding party, partially because I didn't want to deal with those decisions. But what hurts so much is that they asked practically everyone else they know to stand up except me. His cousins wife they've only know a year is a bridesmaid. A guy friend who my best friend has talked so much shit about in the past 3 years is a groomsman. etc. If it weren't for inclusions like that, if they only had 5 people each, I wouldn't feel so upset.  But it almost feels like a deliberate insult.


A few months ago, he was telling me how hard it was going to be to pick a best man and said itd be easier if he could just pick me. We've talked multiple times over the years about how when his day came, I'd throw on a tux and stand up with him. And now I'm going to feel so embarrassed at the wedding because every other person in our crew is up there but me.


I do understand somewhat. She and I aren't close, but we do get along at this point. She's not the type to have her princess wedding soiled by a lady in a tux, but I could have worn a nice black dress. And for fucks sake, he could have told me rather than let me find out like that! I wanna know, did he even suggest me? Did he get shot down and did he even try to change her mind? Or did he really just decide I'm not an important part of his life anymore after 20 years? Hell, he called me to go out to brunch with them the morning after the courthouse wedding, just the 3 of us! But now I'm not good enough for the wedding party? 


Ugh, this hurts so bad. Please help - am I being petty and making it too big of a deal? Should I tell him how hurt I am, and if so, how?

My mom is a divorcee, single mother for 20 years ++. When I was at school, she told me not to date or have any relationship with men for fear of me becoming a young divorcee like her (she married my father at 18 and ironically their divorce was because of her cheating).

Well I'm careful enough not to mention any of my male friend to her because she might get angry and as a result, won't talk to me for few WEEKS. She LOVE the silent treatment. I used to be the one to apologize and everything.

Now that I'm older I strongly voice my opinion about marriage and relationship. She knows I don't believe in marriage.

But when I told my mother I just came back from dinner with him (because I know no one in this area!) she warned me not to get too close with him, don't mix business with pleasure. I flipped. I told her So what if I did. Huh? So what? and she said So you like him then huh? You intend to make him your boyfriend? You're really that desperate?

14116,Non-Romantic,2cscs1,"So, I have been friends with Hannah and Greg since our freshman year of high school and now we are coming up on our junior year of college. Greg and I go to the same school while Hannah goes to a different one. Things have always been great. Nothing to complain about. 

This summer, I got a sweet internship out by my school and was planning to live with my boyfriend for the summer. I was excited but sorta bummed that that I would not be home for the summer with Hannah and Greg because we always do fun stuff together. I was always planning to have them make the 2.5 hour trip out to visit me one weekend to hang out and catch up. My boyfriend was gone on a study abroad trip for two weeks so I invited them (and one of our other friends (M21), but he is irrelevant to this story) out when he was gone so I wasn't lonely for the weekend. 

I was excited as shit to have them out! I told them I would cook for them and do awesome things and whatnot. I asked for like $10 from each of them to pay back for the food and snacks that I bought, they said it wasn't a problem.

So the weekend comes and we go to the mall and go the mall and do friend things. We start drinking and whatnot at night and chill. Hannah and Greg start getting too comfy on the couch and it was making me uncomfortable. I see them kissing sometimes but I try to advert my attention to the other friend and just ignore it. We sit around a BS for a few hours and I have enough of the Hannah and Greg show of them on the couch and bragging about all the fun shit they have been doing all summer while I am out here at my 'boring job.' I casually say that I am tired and want to sleep and so do they.

I expected them to leave that next morning at like noon. No. They left at like 5:30p and kept asking me what plans we had for the day. They were getting under my skin and being immauture about everything. Eventually they left and I was peaceful. Oh and they never paid me for all the food I bought, which pissed me off. I reminded them and Greg even brought it up but nothing. Not like that money is going to make or break me, but it was just the point. 

Since that weekend (about a month ago), I have had ZERO desire to text or communicate with both Hannah or Greg. That whole weekend just left a bad taste in my mouth with either of them. But they haven't contacted me either. I am okay with that. Greg's birthday was the other day and all of my friends from home went to this awesome state park to hike and stuff all day. It is like an hour from where I live. They were posting on facebook all day about how much fun they are having. I felt salty that I wasn't even invited (I know I work fulltime, but an invite is nice and I totally would have tried to get off to be there). 

I just feel that I grew up this summer and they haven't. I work 40 hours a week at a desk job and come home to by boyfriend each night and love it. They work local part-time jobs and spend all their money on weed (which I have stopped doing and absolutely love my decision to quit, I feel like new person). I still value them as people and see them as friends, but I cannot connect with them because I feel I am more 'mature' then them. I'm in a tough place.

So I guess I am looking for to see if other people have had this I grew up and my friends haven't situation and was able to rekindle the relationship from it. Any advice? Thanks!

So, I started dating my boyfriend Bob two years ago. He and his ex-girlfriend Sydney had broken up 9 months before, but were still on good terms and still living together. 

I was accointed with Sydney, because she's a good friend of Sandra, who's also a good friend of mine. We knew eachother but were not really close or anything. I felt kind of guilty dating her boyfriend, but when he told her she reassured everyone saying there was no problem etc.. Well the next morning it was a problem, she got really pissed at him, saying he shouldn't have told her because we were casual and she doesn't want to be made aware of every one he fucks. 

I saw her, an she kept reassuring me that I had done nothing wrong, she just have wished Bob dealed with it differently.

It was very casual in the first two month because Bob had to move for work at the end of summer, so we were supposed to split by that time. We did everything we could to hide it from her, taking her on her wish. 

We couldn't see eachother at their place for obvious reasons, and I didn't really have a place of my own, so Sandra lended me her keys while she was on hollydays. That's were it goes bad. Sydney got really pissed at Sandra for giving us a place to fuck, she got really pissed at Bob for not telling her we were really dating and not just fucking around, she stopped talking to every one. All that saying she still wasn't mad at me, because I had nothing to do with all that since we were not intimate friends. Well. I didn't really bought it, because I was the one fucking her ex-boyfriend, but whatever.

I thought we were all good since she wasn't talking with Sandra and Bob, ties were cut, and that's it. I saw Sydney once, because we have a couple common friends and I wanted to be on good terms with her, at least not open war. She kept up the you're not the problem, I'm just pissed at them. talk, but then went on to badmouth Bob to me, so I wasn't really going to keep contact. Our other common friends were not in all these stuff, and were not made to choose a camp or anything.

She eventually forgave Sandra, since they were really close friend. I moved out to follow Bob something like seven months later. I still see common friends when I come back for a week end or whatever, and it's never a problem, they just see her any other time.

Our relationship is great, there's nothing to say really about it, it follows its course.

Sandra had a birthday party this year, and I didn't went because Sydney was there. Bob and I are kind of pissed with how it went down and would rather stay away from drama. 

Thing is, another friend (Stella) is having her birthday this week, I planned it with her boyfriend (Rodrigo), it's just a casual get together and a meal. Thing is, Rodrigo is not aware of all this drama bullshit, and invited Sydney. 

I don't know what to do, because I don't want to ask him to uninvite her for my sake, and I also don't want to see her. All the while, I really want to come to Stella's birthday since she's a very good friend I don't see often. 
Any advice?

If anything, I have no idea how she would react if we just come and pretend everything's allright. She's kind of passive agressive, and she's still pissed at Bob from what I know.

He's not just slightly overweight however, he's 5'8 and about 310lbs. He was told he has Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) and it's caused by his high blood pressure combined with how overweight he is, and was told it's so bad that he *needs* to lose weight, or he'll be dead in two years. He came home pretty shook up and pretty upset, and asked me (6'1, 190lbs for measure) to help him, because he knows I eat and exercise well. We've never had a good relationship, but I agreed.

I made a list of things for my parents to buy during their weekly shop for him to have instead of the regular stuff he eats. He's always had a poor diet so I knew diving in and completely transforming his diet would be difficult on him, so we made it gradual. Low calorie meals, only drinking water and green tea, and 3 unhealthy snack foods a week. The first month went pretty well, dropping 4lbs, although I did expect more.

Second month was a bit suspect because he seemed to be leaving earlier than usual for work, and coming back later than usual. The same diet but with no unhealthy snack foods, more fruit and I even got him to sign up for a weight loss class at our local pool and he agreed to go once a week. Took his weight at the end of the month and...no weight change at all. Really suspicious now, and he acts just as confused as me.

Third month, and he's going swimming three times a week, diet is going well and he's genuinely enjoying the healthier meals. But yesterday I took his weight and he's gained 5lbs. There's literally *no* way he can gain weight based on the healthy diet and exercise, and he's still leaving early/coming back late from work, and he even tried to blame it on the me and the diet he's on. So I decided to do a bit of investigating, and yeah...

First I checked his bank statement from the past month, and I discovered that early in the mornings and late at nights, he's been going to shops about spending £6/7 a trip. The statement doesn't list the specific items, but the odd totals suggest he's been buying a fair amount of snack foods. I go to the garage (his hobby is fixing virtually broken cars) and he's been hiding empty wrappers in the bin in there. I'm close to tears that he's not been taking it seriously. So me and mum confronted him about it, my mum started crying, and it was only then he seemed upset. I said he was only upset because we caught him eating chocolate and crisps when he was supposed to be dropping them, and he went out for a few hours. I'm going to call the weight loss swimming club tomorrow because now I'm pretty sure he's only been once, the first time. I don't know what to do or say to him now.

We're all pretty close with each other, go to concerts together, discuss literature, we cook, sit around until 2am drinking wine and have breakfast with our couchsurfers and stuff.

During my time abroad I was in touch with Paul, as a joke he would regularly send me updates on the stuff that broke or talk about his master's thesis.

When I moved back I already had a slight gut feeling that he might have a crush on me. I wasn't really sure so I brushed it of and just focused on fitting back into the whole roommate dynamic in our apartment.

He made no clear indication of liking me, it was just the sliiiightly too long look and laughing just a tiny second too much. It was so fucking subtle, I wasn't really sure if I was just imagining it. Still, to be on the safe side, I made sure to always be properly dressed when walking around the apartment and pretend that everything was normal.

Today things kinda changed when we were out for a beer and I mentioned (on purpose) that I was having a date next week. When we got back home he mentioned in the hallway that he might have to distance himself from me because it's too close. I didn't really say anything to that, just that's alright and went to my room - only to receive a text from him 10 min later saying that sounded weird but I noticed that this morning and I need to be careful. I am stupid at times.

Haven't responded so far. I am really glad that he realized that and takes that right consequences. Of course I will stay away from him for a while to make it easier. Hopefully it won't come to the point where one of us has to move out, we'll see. I haven't led him on at all, never indicated that I might be interested but I still feel very guilty for possibly hurting his feelings.

I feel like there is no point in talking about anything but still, should I talk about it? Pretend that everything is fine and nothing happened over breakfast? Leave the room as fast as possible? What about the party we're hosting tomorrow??? Hanna's home for the holiday so I am pretty lost on how to proceed.

tl;dr roommate never made a move on me but when I mentioned having a date he communicates the need to distance himself. I don't know how to prevent things from going completely awkward?

14180,Non-Romantic,2l0i6i,"I live with a friend who often does petty things around the house which really annoy the heck out of me, because his way of doing a thing is just illogical to me, but normal to him. 

He does not see anything wrong with it, and when I try to suggest the more logical way of doing it without a doubt an argument ensues where I'll basically get too upset and react in a way which probably hurts him. 

I don't remember other examples, but they are all pretty similar, here is one from today: 

There are usually two sponges in the kitchen: one for dishes, another one 'dirtier' for the worktop. I think it makes sense to have a new dish sponge every few days for hygiene reasons: the old 'work top' sponge gets thrown  away, the old dish sponge becomes the new worktop sponge, and the dishes get cleaned with a completely fresh sponge. 

My friend washed up today, and took out a new sponge (last clean one there was!), and used that one to clean the messy work top with a window cleaner detergent, leaving an old dish sponge because in his eyes it was still 'new'. 
To me it did not make sense at all: now we had a dirty dish sponge and a new sponge which could not be used for dish washing because it had window cleaner and muck from allover the place on it. 

When I tried to explain to him that my method was more economical and his wasted our last clean sponge we argued and I got angry/upset with him for not seeing the most obviously logical way of doing it. 



It is a very petty issue and I feel both that I was absolutely in the right about it, but also that I overreacted given the size of the issue. 

If he saw my side of things and changed what he was doing, it would have been a non-issue, but he did not, he kept insisting that his way was right, which obviously increased the conflict. 

Given the fact that he insisted on doing things in an worse way  I am not sure if the issue is entirely mine, or if he also shares some responsibility for the issue blowing out of proportion. 

I view it there are either right or wrong ways of doing things, he sees it  as each of us having our own way of doing things and as me imposing my way on him. But how can using a window cleaner to wash the kitchen worktop be 'right'?  
He somehow sees it a personal criticism of *him*, when it is not meant as such, and then the argument escalates.

When I was younger I've always been a little shy with girls. This has changed a lot during summer break two years ago when I've met a lot of girl-friends in a camp. That is why I have been socialy less awkward, especially when school started. Because of all that I've met a female friend R (first letter of her name) which was in the same elementary school.
We've been very good friends for a year and when we both went to 9th grade, we became best friends. I often fantasized about R and I really liked her. But after 5 months I met another girl which was really into me and I started dating her. When I told R about that she was a bit down and she joked about us dating and that I cheated on her, but I knew it wasn't all a joke. 
About a month later I started to hang out with R more than my gf. Some of our schoolmates thought  we were dating, but R and I knew we were just very good friends.
School ended quickly and we both went to different high schools. The only time we have seen each other during summer  was at a friend's party. R and I were in a pool alone and have been talking and joking. After a while her female friend also came in the pool. I wanted to kiss R or start something, because I knew I was going to breakup with my gf, but I wasn't feeling ready. It was a screw up. When R left the party she forgot her sunglasses. And I took them home so I could bring them back to R. 
We both didn't find time to catch up and for me to bring her the sunglasses during the summer. That was a big mistake, because I have changed a lot during that short period of time. I've started smoking weed and I also broke up with my gf. 
In september I brought R her sunglasses and I was really high. She doesn't like smoking or drinking which made me look really bad. 
We have been talking about getting back together for 6 months but whenever I ask her she is making  excuses why she can't meet me. I know she doesn't want to see me, because our mutual friend told me that she thinks I am a stoner.
I've seen her on a bus a few times and when we talked there wasn't much difference between now and last year when we hung out daily.

I really don't know what to do. I dont wan't to lose her because she means a lot to me. I only want to be friends again, nothing more. Please help!

14198,Non-Romantic,33zl7l,"Throwaway as people know my main. My friend, Kyle, has been my best friend as long as I can remember. Possibly around three years old we started to hangout.


We met through our older brothers who were the same age and hung out. We got along easily. He lives .2 miles away if that gives you an idea, it's 3.52 football fields. He is also a year older, making him a year ahead in school also. He's older by nearly 11 months and a few weeks.


Since then, things have been great. We've done many things together, hangout every weekend, mostly everyday in the summer. We're really similar in personalities. Like to do the same things like ride bikes, play games, do the same things, etc,. Do everything together.


In December, I introduced him to a girl I knew on the Interwebs that I met on a game. She was just a friend to me. We played Minecraft together. 


Shortly later, they started dating. Things didn't change between us.


About a month ago, things started to become weird, weird things started to show up to his girlfriend, that I'll call Ally. 


Things started to become weird with between him and her first but it was like things that have always happened between him and I. We hardly text as we always talk when we hangout and just text to see if we're hanging out that day. They started to not talk as much, he wouldn't respond. Their choice of communication was Kik. Messages would be marked that Ally sent to Kyle as read instantly or later but wouldn't respond most of the time. 


About a month ago (actually tomorrow it'd be a month), things started to become weird between Kyle and I. 


March 27 (around 5):


I text him to hangout and he responds that he can later, okay no biggie. Probably has some things to do, whatever.


March 27th (around 9):


I know it's late before you say anything, but he hasn't said anything between this time and 5 besides Later. I text him saying ??, no response, then  Can you hangout?? and he responds No. Now, I'm a bit annoyed as he hasn't said anything, spent my whole night waiting and he says no instantly after I ask Can you..? so I assume he knew by then he couldn't. I was now on break starting at 2:30 when I got out so that even made it worse that I spent my first day in the house. We hangout the next day (28th), so nothing to bad... yet.


April 2nd: 


This was his start of spring break (we go to separate schools as of 5th grade, when I was 10). At around four, I ask him to hangout. He responded saying he couldn't but could get on playstation. This was a bit weird as like why couldn't he hangout on his first day. I get on and we play some good ole' Cod, the older ones. We hangout the next day, but still bit weird. He doesn't say what he's doing or why he can't hangout.


April 8th: 


I ask him to hangout at around 5:30 and he says he can't but he said he can get on playstation at 10. That's a bit more reasonable, like he might be getting home at 10 and what's the point of hanging out for an hour. 


April 9th: 


At 7 I ask him to hangout. He says that he couldn't that the time and then an hour and a half go by (it's now 8:30) and I ask him if he can hangout which he responds he can't. 


April 11th:


I ask him to hangout and he said maybe. Then I ask him if he's been busy and he says Yeah then almost instantly responds saying I got my permit yesterday. I don't know if he's trying to change the topic or what. Even if that's what has been keeping him busy from the 8th till now doesn't explain anything before it. I assume we hungout as I didn't nag him again so I assume I called him or something.


I haven't said anything about Ally in a while but I'll update you now. Ally said they're hardly talking, at this point every few days and gives short answers, hardly responds (Ally said about Kyle).


The 13th I ask him to hangout, it was a weekday which means school but it was nice out and we live in a cold area city so it was like SPRING HAS ARRIVED FINALLY moment. He says maybe then says he'll be home in ~15 and find out then. This was at around 3:20 and at 4:10 he says he can't due to homework.


The 17th of April (Friday) I ask him to hangout and he says he can't since he has track and this was at about 4. I understand this but he can't after? I didn't ask that.


April the 18th:


His dad calls me from his own phone (Dad's phone) speaking fairly quickly saying Hey, yeah DontDMCrazy_Kids? Jeremy's phone is dead and was wondering if you want to hangout. I said yeah but it told me a few things:


1. I knew his dad was lying about Kyle wanting to hangout.


2. I also knew his dad was lying about Kyle's phone being dead.


He puts Kyle on the phone and I ask him how long it'll take him. He asks his parent's and then says 15 mins.... hour later he has finally arrived. I figured he was on the way home from somewhere too.


This past Friday, April 24th: 


I ask Kyle around 6:30 if he can hangout and he says no but he can get on playstation or Skype. I ask him when he can get on which is in about an hour. I ended up not getting on and went out at 9 and came home at 10:30 and asked if he wanted to play then and didn't respond.


Yesterday, Saturday:


I ask him to hangout and he said no. This was around 6:30 and he said no. Then I proceed to ask him out playstation and he said yeah and I ask him when, he said now.


We get on and play some old WaW:Zombies. At around 18 we had a crawler (a zombie w/ no legs, gives you time to run to the urination station, grab a drink, grab a snack, etc,.) and I said this:


Me: Kyle.


Kyle: Yeah?


Me: Why couldn't you hangout today?


No response. I say it again. No response. I say it once again. No response. I wait a minute then I ask him if he's ready to start the next round. He responded by saying yeah then I asked him why he couldn't hangout and he responds busy really quickly. This was at about ~9:30. Then I said brb getting a drink, we still didn't kill the crawler as we were waiting for it to reach us. When I get back, game was over, he was offline and I asked him what happened. He said he had to get off. I kinda assume it was bullshit for three reasons:


1. His parents give him a heads up on when he has to get off and you'll hear them yell down and hear him respond.


2. If he did truly have to get off and his parent's give him a heads up as usual, he did say he would make sure I wasn't killed by the crawler and didn't say  he had to get off soon.


3. Is curfew on playstation is usually 11. 


I told Ally today about what had happened, it went like this:


Me: (explained zombies thing)


Ally: Oh? He hasn't messaged me since I asked him a question


Me: You don't find that weird?


Ally: I do. I really do. But he does that to me actually.


Me: He's been weird and I have no idea what to do.


Ally: He hasn't been talking to me


Me: It's really weird, last week his dad called me saying that Kyle wanted to hangout (I knew it was a lie, could tell by his voice) and said Kyle's phone died.


Ally: Uhmm.... Kyle's phone rarely dies?


Me: Exactly. He said that bc he wanted Kyle to hangout with someone. Like if he didn't say that I'd be suspicious as to why Kyle couldn't call.


Ally: Yeah, when I message Kyle he gives me one word answers, if not no answers and I just forget those questions. But the last question I asked was about me and him, he read it instantly but never replied.


Me: What should we do. He didn't tell me he got a job. (still hasn't)


Ally: He didn't tell me he does track.


Me: Won't tell me what he's doing. Just specifies busy or something


Ally: Yeah I got that too many times.

14209,Non-Romantic,2cheje,"I’ve [26f] lived with my roommate Emma [25f] for two years. We’re both relatively quiet people and I have no complaints about our living situation. Over the last two years, we’ve both had guests stay in our apartment for a few days. It’s never been a problem. Because Emma is kind of a shy person, it’s just worked out that I’ve had more guests stay with us.



On Thursday, Emma mentioned that her father was going to be coming on Friday to visit for a week. It’s pretty short notice, but I guess her dad just sprung it on her at the last minute. I told her I was fine with it (partly because I’ve had more guests stay here so it didn’t seem fair to say no).



I knew Emma’s dad was ex-military and pretty conservative. I also knew Emma has had a hard time standing up to her dad in the past (given how shy she is). But I wasn’t quite prepared for what’s happened this weekend.



I had to stay late at work yesterday, and by the time I got home, Emma’s dad was already here. He had kind of taken charge of the apartment. He introduced himself to me and “laid down a few ground rules.” Ummm. I thought it was my apartment?



He started off with a very pompous “introduction.” I can’t do it justice, but it went something like this:  “I live a disciplined life. It’s what I learned in the military, and it’s what got me to where I am today. Some people think I’m strict. I’m actually a fair person, but you have to earn my respect first.”



Apparently I had already done something to make him lose respect in me. I had a few bottles of wine, a bottle of port (which I use to cook!) and a bottle of tequila in the kitchen. He was very upset that I was creating an environment of “loose morals” around his daughter. So…. He had dumped all my alcohol down the drain and told me that I had to do a lot of work to gain back his respect. 



Oh yeah, also he wakes up early, so it was unacceptable that I would come back into the apartment after 10:30 any night.


Honestly, I was just stunned that he would behave this way. I sat there dumbfounded because, while I wanted to tell him off, I didn’t want to cause any tension for Emma. I wanted to act in a way that was respectful to Emma, but I was so confused in the moment, that I just blanked and kind of meekly said it was nice to meet him.



My boyfriend stopped by about an hour later with some dinner for me. We ate it in my room because Emma and her dad were in the living room/dining room area and I didn’t feel comfortable being around him.



My bf and I spent a couple hours watching Netflix, then he decided to get ready for bed (he has a toothbrush and some other stuff in our bathroom since he stays over a lot). That’s when I heard the yelling start.



Emma’s dad saw my bf getting ready for bed and was NOT ok with a guy spending the night in my room. I stepped into the hallway and Emma’s dad was right in front of my bf’s face yelling. I tried to intervene, but he just started yelling at me that I was a “disgrace” and had no moral character.



Emma came up to us and started crying and begging her dad to stop, but he ordered her into her room (she obeyed).



Emma’s dad kept yelling at my bf and my bf finally just said he would go home to keep the peace. (He lives with his parents at the moment. His parents ok with my bf spending the night with me, but the ground rules are that I can’t sleep over there, which I respect. Otherwise I would have gone with him).



So I went to bed crying. I got up early, did some laundry, hung my things up to dry and left to spend the day with my bf. I got back a few hours ago and Emma’s dad needed to have another conversation with me.



Apparently the dresses I had hung up to dry in the corner of our living room were inappropriate (too short, not “modest”). He went into a long talk. Again, I can’t do it justice but it went something like this: “Your lifestyle is, frankly disappointing. Normally it wouldn’t be any of my business that you degrade yourself, but when you live with my daughter and surround her with filth, it becomes my business.” Then he said while he’s here that his rules were going to apply, and that meant: lights out at 10:30, I need to dress “modestly,” my bf is not allowed to come over at all, and I’m not allowed to see him after dinner time (what??).



Also, tomorrow is Sunday, and Sunday means I have to go to church with him and Emma. During all of this, I’m still just dumbfounded. I feel terrible for Emma, and I still didn’t want to say anything that would make her life more difficult. But I told him that I wasn’t comfortable going to church with them, and he said basically that my life would become very difficult if I didn’t follow these rules.



So. I decided to go to my room for the rest of the night and just not engage any further with him. At 10:30 he pounded on my door and said “lights out.” I didn’t want any more trouble, so I complied, and now I can’t sleep so I’m looking for advice on reddit.



Basically, I failed to establish proper boundaries yesterday (because I didn’t want to make things difficult for Emma) and now he feels like he can walk all over me. I don’t want to go to church tomorrow. How can I hold this line? How can I survive the rest of this week?



Tl;dr: My roommate’s ex military father is visiting for a week, and he’s running our apartment like its his house. He kicked my bf out, got rid of my booze, and now I have to go to church tomorrow with them. Help me establish proper boundaries.



**Edit** I want to thank everyone for the advice, but can you guys please give me solutions that don't involve calling the police. I'll obviously do that if my safety is in danger, but short of that, I don't want to involve the police. Emma is a shy person, and this would absolutely mortify her. I know this experience can be an example to show her how to establish boundaries with her father, but if I go right to the police, it will become far more of a nightmare than it needs to be.


**Morning Edit Ok, I woke up this morning to a lot of comments. Not many of them are actually very helpful. It seems like most people here are just egging me on so they can get a big confrontation between me and Emma's dad. Everyone pushing me to get Emma's dad to freak out to the point that I need to call the police doesn't really care about the situation. I value my friendship with Emma, and I want to solve this without pushing it to a place that needs the police. Emma's my friend, and I don't want to humiliate her. I also don't like confrontation. It's just my personality. Why can't people give me advice that will play to my personal strengths instead of pushing me to do things that I'm not comfortable with? When I play to my strengths, I'm more confident.**


**As for this morning, I just didn't want a giant fight. I waited until I heard Emma's dad get in the bathroom, then I left the apartment and drove around for a while until my bf woke up. He took me out for breakfast, and we're going to spend the day together. So no, I'm not going to church.**


**Afternoon edit:** I want to really thank those people who are providing constructive advice. You guys are really helping me think through this. There's lots of other people who are just kind of freaking out in the comments. This isn't very helpful :/  I know I'm not approaching this the way you want me to, but this is a serious situation for me. I get the feeling my situation is just entertainment for a lot of you.

There have been a few developments. I've been hanging out with my bf. His parents offered to let me sleep on their couch. I'm definitely going to take them up on the offer later in the week. The problem is Monday/Tuesday. I have very important meetings early at work. His parents live far away from my office, and I don't function well when I have to get up exceptionally early. So I might go back to sleep in my apartment tonight and tomorrow night, but I might decide it's not worth it.

The bigger development is that Emma's dad sent me a couple of text messages from her phone this afternoon. They weren't threatening or anything, but he basically called me a coward for sneaking out and said that I was behaving like a disrespectful teenager. He went on about how respect is earned, and that he's lost all respect in me. And that the issue has now moved beyond his opinion of me, because I've personally disrespected and offended him. The texts are just more ridiculous blustering. So far I just haven't responded.

I was his age when I lost my v card so I don't really care he's having sex, but IMO if you're too embarassed or too broke to buy condoms yourself, you're too immature to be having sex. Plus I'm really annoyed he's been coming into my room and stealing my things, even though I'm glad he's smart enough to know he should use condoms.

But still this is...awkward. But I do need to say SOMETHING. How do I even begin this conversation?

I was asked to be a bridesmaid for a friend of the family. The bride is actually a friend of my younger sister, but as my sister is living abroad at the moment, the bride asked me to be her bridesmaid for her wedding in August, sort of because my sister can't do it. It is a bit strange for me honestly, also because I'm older than all the other 9 bridesmaids and they seem a bit immature at times. 

The bride's parents are quite well off, but surprisingly tight with their money and of course, the bride hates it. The parents gave her a budget and from day 1 she constantly complained about it. It seems she wants a really luxurious wedding, and wants her parents to pay for everything. There are about 100 people on the confirmed guest list and it will take place at a hotel, where all the guests will stay for the weekend (on their own expense, I might add). So there will be a champagne reception, the ceremony, dinner, party and then a brunch on the next day. As her daddy won't pay for all her crazy ideas, the bride seems to think that we, the bridesmaids, should pay the rest or at least do the rest, for example, all the wedding decoration has to be bought and made by the bridesmaids - that's what the bride wanted as a wedding gift from us. However, she also has a long list of other presents and we have weekly meet-ups that are hosted by one of the bridesmaids. We also have to pay for the hotel and the 250€ **orange** dress. I should maybe add that I don't live in the US and having bridesmaids is fairly uncommon where I'm from, so I have no idea if this is normal, but additionally, we have to cook the food and buy the champagne for the reception and organize ( = most likely pay) a DJ for the party. 

There will also be a bachelorette **weekend** at a spa that the maid of honour has to pay for and we all agreed to pitch in because she can't afford it on her own. 

We've all told the bride to compromise, but she is completely out of her mind, screaming at everyone who suggests anything like that. She already kicked one bridesmaid out and replaced her the next day with a coworker. It seems she doesn't care at all what happens after the wedding, and she doesn't even care if she'll lose friends over the wedding, as long as the wedding is the one of her dreams. 

Now, I've found out that some of her bridesmaids are planning on ruining the wedding as some kind of revenge. As much as I hate the behaviour of the bride (especially because I know her as a nice person), the solution to this problem is certainly not messing with her on her wedding day. The ruining part consists of putting up ugly decoration, dying one of the orange dresses a slightly different colour so the photos will be ruined, bringing food to the reception that the bride doesn't like / **is allergic to**, accidently not telling the DJ the right time and place and so on. I have also noticed them talking bad about the bride to several people including the groom and spreading lies behind her back. 

I don't know which side to take and would honestly just love to drop out of the whole thing. However, I feel like I'm the one who may be able to prevent a catastrophic wedding day for the bride as ALL the other bridesmaids (including the maid of honor!!) seem to be completely psyched by the idea to take revenge. 

One more thing, that could probably cause the bride the most trouble, is that she confided in us to take some of her dad's money that is meant for the wedding (for example the DJ) to use it for her honeymoon, which the dad doesn't pay for. If the bridesmaids tell the father, I'm afraid there might be a real problem!

14269,Non-Romantic,2pa0k7,"Faux Thanksgiving was the Tuesday after the normal holiday; all of the talk was about her 18 year old, single, uneducated, unemployed, knocked up sister. That's fine. It was all super positive and everyone (except those of us with brains) is excited for her. My wife's aunt and uncle were there. They didn't say hello to me and only spoke to me to show me a picture of their dog. They also walked past me to say goodbye to others and didn't acknowledge me again. Then, we found out, her mother and said knocked up sister started shit talking us as soon as we left. 

Her mother originally did not intend to come to our wedding. After she was called out on it, she decided she would show up. Knocked up sister had an appointment and didn't show up. Mother made fun of our venue, made fun of my wife's outfit and feet, and complained that it was too small of a wedding. She left as soon as possible, no congratulations were offered and she texted later asking for her Crock Pot back since she forgot it. She owes my wife 15 dollars for a Mary Kay item and we haven't seen the money despite asking several times and really needing the money, and I felt it was ballsy to ask for it back when she owes us.

Last night was the family Christmas party. The only people who said hello to me were my MIL's ex roomate who felt awkward that everyone was ignoring me and my wife's other aunt. The pregnant sister tried to push me down some stairs and everyone else pretty much just ignored me. My wife was said hello to, I was just ignored.

My wife also has 3 younger sisters; they're 15, 15, and 13. I went all out on gifts for them. They're great kids and we get along great. I do not feel at all motivated or obligated to get gifts for the mother or other sister for Christmas. I need my money more. I am sick of going to things like this to be treated like shit.

I just want to start out by saying my family is a cohesive and supportive environment, so I was never abused as a child. I was always a good kid and did well in high school, and I've come back home for the summer from college. 


However, I gained some 25 lbs because of stress eating and poor lifestyle habits. I've also picked up powerlifting as a hobby. As a result, I am a lot chunkier and more muscular than when my parents last saw me. After returning home, my mother was horrified by how I looked and started a daily routine of criticizing my weight. She would say that I was fat, that I looked like a man, that I wouldn't find a boyfriend with the way I was now. Just a note - I am Chinese, and in our culture it is more acceptable for parents to say these things to kids. It didn't just stay within the house though, and whenever one of her friends saw me, they would comment that I had gained weight (again Chinese culture), and my mother would then try to justify the extra pounds to the specific friend. She told me that it was for my benefit (wtf?). I had already realized that my weight could become a problem if I didn't pay attention, so I started weightlifting seriously along with macro counting (a type of calorie counting) to make sure I would lose fat while maintaining muscle, but visual progress has been slow despite my consistency. This gave her more ammo to throw at me about how my science-based weight loss was bad for me, that I was eating too many chemicals and other broscience crap. After some arguments, I told her that what she was doing was very hurtful and so she toned down her comments, which I appreciate. Occasionally, she starts to criticize me again, but I just try to ignore it because on the whole she was doing a better job. 

However, just today, a terrible fight broke out. I was commenting lightheartedly that many of my bad lifestyle habits, including the way I eat, probably stem from my mother. In my opinion, I was barely critical at all. She clearly didn't see it that way though, and became REALLY defensive. She argued that whatever her eating habits, she looks better than me (ignoring everything else I said about organization, watching too much TV, etc). I grew angry as well and told her I didn't look bad and I was just pointing out something that I had noticed. I wasn't trying to belittle her. Things quickly escalated after I told her that whenever someone criticized her, she would always ignore it and turn it onto the other person. Sure enough, she totally ignored what I was saying and started screaming that I was fat, incredibly ugly, and that I took after my father with my small and ugly eyes, that she had been restraining herself from saying all these things to me. It quickly grew into a mostly one-sided screaming match where she told me, among other things, that everything that was coming out of her mouths were all the truths that no one wanted to say, and then threw a picture of me on the floor where it shattered. Even worse, she dragged my father in who had agreed with my first statement, and told him that he was a terrible father for siding with me and not her, how could he allow her daughter to say these things to her own mother, that he was a terrible parent who was letting my brother fail with his bad grades, and so on. She told me to get out of house, so I sat outside for about an hour and then came back in after I had calmed down a bit. As soon as I came back, she flared up again and turned on my father (and me by proximity).

I don't really know what to do. I love my mother, but she can say some incredibly hurtful things in her anger. I almost want to call it borderline abusive, but perhaps I'm too sensitive? Talking with her about it will do nothing because she just doesn't listen to anything critical about herself it if it's coming from someone else.

I have an 18 year old adopted son. I only point out that he's adopted because its relevant. He has attachment issues, and has always acted like a lone-wolf who doesn't need anyone. He also has abandonment issues. Its a funky combination. He'd rather do his own thing without us; but if he feels we're abandoning him in anyway, its a problem.


We worked on him being part of a normal family. He use to just take off on his foster parents, without warning. We worked on him at least telling us that he was heading out, and where he was going. Last year I made him write a sign on his door to remind him to tell us he's heading out. It took 3-4 days of him hissy fitting, but he finally did it. 

There was no problem after that until he turned 18.

Now he's a man. A full blown adult who know's things. 

What I am having troubles with, is now that' he's 18...and he's a man now with a real job. (Its a paper route, yes that is still a job.) he stopped telling us when he leaves or spends the night elsewhere. He's still in high school, still dependent on us to provide for him. When he is home he stays in his room playing games. He doesn't believe he needs to do anymore chores, because again, I'm a man now with a real job. He doesn't contribute to any bills; but his paper route pays barely anything. 

He stopped reading any of our messages.  if he's not home, I message him on FB and he was always good about responding, until now.

He won't be gone just yet, he's got one more year of school. But he's always been so independent. All the work we did to get him to live like he's part of a family is tossed out the window. He's back to where he was before; and determined to stay that way. 

I will be setting simple rules, once I can pin him down and talk to him. I plan to tell him that we're respecting his desire for more adult freedoms but..he still has to follow simple family rules:

*  Tell us when you'll be out. ~ I honestly don't care if he's always at his GF's or best friends place....just tell us.

* Read our messages; don't just ignore them.

* Come home and say Hi once a day. (To avoid him from completely isolating himself in his room playing games.

I wanted opinions on whether I should do more? How do parents let go.

I didn't expect to have to let go until he was out of high school and starting college. I guess it was wishful thinking considering how independent and stubborn he was when we adopted him. Its a natural part of the aging process..he's just doing it a little earlier then I had hoped. 

I want to relax some of the rules, but still expect some things to happen. Seeing as he's still just in high school and dependent.

14305,Non-Romantic,2p1o0a,"I'll start this off by saying that I am pretty much blind to manipulation and passive aggression. I've had plenty of times in my life where I thought I was having a fine conversation with so-and-so at a party, only to find out from everyone afterwards that so-and-so was making rude comments to/about me the whole time. I can think of one person from high school who was truly mean and tried (and succeeded) to manipulate me, and I only noticed after she did the same thing to a close friend, and I could view it from the outside. The whole experience was very unpleasant. I will call manipulative friend from high school Brandy.

I have been at the same job for 2 years now. The company is small and we have a fairly close group of friends who all started roughly at the same time. This includes my husband (of 1 year), and my coworker Johnny. To be honest, I really never liked Johnny, but I felt bad about it because he is very nice (just annoys me for some reason). I have always been friendly with him and we small talk when we end up in the elevator together. He is not really in the group, but he is always invited to social gatherings (he just rarely shows up). 

About 6 months ago, at some social gathering, he mentioned his girlfriend was moving to our city. No one knew he had a girlfriend, so people reacted with What? You have a girlfriend? Really? and How come we haven't heard about her before?, etc. We haven't seen him outside of work since, and no one has met her. Some people (including my husband) have joked at work with him that she doesn't exist. Johnny told everyone that she was just very introverted, and wouldn't feel comfortable meeting so many people at once, so that's why they haven't been around.

Last week, I got a text message from a number I didn't recognize. It was Johnny's girlfriend, Mandie. She introduced herself and asked if we could get coffee over the weekend. There was something about her message that just didn't sit right with me...but I couldn't put my finger on it. I ended up realizing that her wording reminded me a lot of Brandy (from high school), and it kind of freaked me out a bit (I am probably still a little traumatized from the Brandy experience). After talking to my husband and showing him the message, I decided that she was probably just socially awkward, and that I would meet with her. In the back of my mind, I was kind of expecting the meeting to be a back of my boyfriend, bitch! conversation (this was one of the things Brandy did). It definitely wasn't that...

We met for coffee on Sunday, and it ended up being 3 hours of her telling me:

* that Johnny is actually a huge jerk and has always been really mean to her (also he hasn't allowed her to attend any social gatherings since she's been in our city)

* that she has a few self-diagnosed mental disorders, all Johnny's fault

* that Johnny has a few mental disorders, which she essentially cured him of 

* that she really wanted to meet me because Johnny talks about me all the time (sounded super Brandy-ish to me...she always tried to make me feel like I was special)

She didn't just say all this stuff...she told it in a way that I can not really describe except...*bitchy*. She just sounded really mean the whole time. She would tell me that Johnny was an idiot, except she would say I told him, are you an idiot?, as she was looking into my eyes and kind of shouting...so that it *really* seemed like she was asking me if I was an idiot. I was freaked out the whole time, but I didn't really know what to do. I should have thought of an exit strategy beforehand, but I'm really bad at that stuff on the fly.

I finally got out of it, and she ended by telling me that she is coming to *my* Christmas party on Friday (it's not my Christmas party, it's another coworkers, which I did tell her). She said that she is really excited to talk to me there, and that she had a great time talking to me.

Basically, I would prefer to never see her again. I also just really got the Brandy-vibe and it freaked me out. So, I would like to know:

* Is she trying to manipulate me? What does she want? 

* How do I avoid her at the party? I feel guilty because she doesn't know anyone else but me...so now I feel like I have to hang out with her. I really really really don't want to...

* Should I give her another chance to not be terrible? That was my biggest problem with Brandy - I kept giving her another chance again and again no matter what she did.

My husband suggested not going to the party...and it pissed me off because what if that's what she wants?

And she's loud. When she isn't blabbering on the phone she's talking to someone she supervises (no, she isn't my boss) in person, and if that doesn't fail she tries to talk to me, and if all else fails she talks to herself (self narrating thoughts and actions).

She also gets very defensive with her annoying antics. She has a habit of clicking her pen over and over while on the phone. So she's like blah blah blah [click click] blah blah [click click click] blah blah blah [click]. I asked her to stop and she got maaaad. I also asked her to lower her voice when she was very loud on the phone (she could be heard down the hall) and she got mad.

14340,Non-Romantic,2q779h,"A little background info for starters-- Husband and I have been married for a little over 2 years and have a one year old, Toddler. I don't have a super great relationship with In-Laws because their behavior can be inconsiderate and flippant. For example, they've forgotten Toddler's name on a few different occasions, they showed up over two hours later to Toddler's first birthday party, and they frequently buy him very age-inappropriate toys and then get upset when I am not able to give them to him. They're also not the most sanitary bunch, have had multiple outbreaks of MRSA in their house, their animals are flea and tick-ridden, etc. Toddler, for the record, is not their only grandchild, but all of Toddler's cousins are elementary school age.


In-Laws recently purchased a second home-- a very dilapidated old house that has been abandoned since 2004-- with the intention of restoring it and turning into a work space for the business In-Laws' run out of their current home. In-Laws are obsessed with this new property because they're obsessed with finding diamonds in the rough. They almost exclusively shop at second hand and antique stores because of this obsession.


In-Laws sent out a Christmas letter detailing the condition of this house. (Why is beyond me.) There were animal and insect infestations, rotted through cans of food, dishes still in the sink from last decade, mold and water damage throughout the property, and there was even concern expressed about the house not being up to code.


In the past, In-Laws have hosted Christmas Eve dinner at their residence and we figured this year would be no different. However it was dropped on us a few days ago that the intention was to host dinner at this newly acquired property. They've recently begun cleaning it out and while the bulk of the mess is gone, there are still real structural issues with the walls, ceiling, and floor that will take longer to finish up. I expressed to my husband that while I would love to attend dinner with his family, this property did not seem safe and ready to house our very mobile and very curious Toddler.


My sister-in-law echoed my concerns but her sons are older, so she has decided to attend. She did state that if she were me, she would not feel comfortable bringing Toddler. Husband called up In-Laws and told them that we were under the impression initially that dinner would be at their normal residence and that we didn't think the new property was ready for Toddler, and he was essentially told that I'm being too cautious, that their daughter-in-laws (myself and sister-in-law) are trying to ruin Christmas, and that they absolutely will not budge on having dinner at the new property. (We had thrown out a few different compromises, such as us hosting, having it at their normal residence, or doing it at a restaurant.)


Husband slept on it and now he's decided that he's on their side, that I'm being overly cautious, but that since it's a safety concern we have to be unanimous and therefore we're still not going. He's super pissed at me though and we've been arguing about it almost non-stop this afternoon. In-Laws sent pictures to try and persuade us to come, but the pictures confirm my fears-- wires everywhere, water damage on the floors, a standing puddle of water in one of the doorways, and debris in every corner.


I don't understand why everyone cannot see that this house is not fit for Toddler to be in yet. I'm not saying it can NEVER happen, I'm just saying it needs to wait until the renovations are done. I don't even know where to begin with navigating this situation, and now I'm wondering if I actually am being overly cautious.

14361,Non-Romantic,1vyord,"Here's the back story (and sorry ahead of time for any grammatical errors, it's freezing at the cafe I'm in and I can barely feel my fingers) :

Last semester I met this girl in one of my classes. From the first time I saw her I thought she was pretty cute but that was about it. Halfway through the semester she struck up a conversation with me, which eventually led to hanging out after class. The first time we hung out was somewhat awkward seeing as we didn't really know each other but boy did she make a lasting impression. In our very first conversation she showed a lot of interest in me and even invited herself to go to a show with me (which I ended up not being able to go to). She had said something in passing about a boyfriend, but it sounded like that was pretty far in the past. For the next few weeks we communicated entirely through Snapchat, which I thought was weird but I didn't really care because she was awesome and we clicked. 

Turns out she had a boyfriend...I should have stopped it once I learned but it was already too late, I had already fallen for this girl. We started seeing each other all the time, talking non-stop, and going on stupid little, romantic cliche adventure-esque date things. 

This went on for a few weeks and shortly thereafter she invited me to her room for her roommate's 20th. At this point I'm sure the people on her floor knew something was going on seeing as I spent so much time with her there the past few weeks, so I was a little uneasy about saying yes.

From the minute I showed up she was constantly at my side. I told her I had work the next morning so I wasn't going to be saying late so I didn't drink at all really, but boy did she. The more she drank the closer she got and the more she made it seem like we were together. When it was time to leave, she wouldn't let me go. Now I definitely knew something was up and explained to her that as much as I didn't want to, I had to. To be honest, I didn't feel comfortable staying at all, she had a boyfriend and clearly wasn't thinking straight. I liked her too much and even though if I stayed there was a good chance of more happening, I just didn't want her to do something she regretted and I didn't want to do something I couldn't live with. Eventually she agreed to let me leave but walked me to her car where she proceeded to kiss me.

A few days later we talked about it and she told me she left her boyfriend and needed time to figure things out. I assured her that I completely understood and would be there if she needed me. A week later we went to dinner, which I thought went well, but apparently later that night he came to get his stuff and they ended up talking things out. As much as I hate to admit it, I was pissed, but it was something I had to live with. 

The next 4 weeks after that was just us constantly talking about how much she wanted to be with me but felt she had to make things work with him. I found out that at the time we met she found out he had cheated on her. I found out that he was absolutely controlling, manipulative, and somewhat verbally abusive. I ended meeting the guy, after spending the day with her, and it all made me feel so bad because I'm not at all sneaky like this.

This continued on for another couple weeks until she basically fell off the face of the Earth. I went 6 months without seeing or hearing of her, but I thought about her every day, I just couldn't get over it, I'm still not over it. 

Last month she appeared again, single this time. We've hung out twice and it's almost as if nothing changed. We talked about what happened a little bit and I asked her why she came back. She told me he deleted me out of her phone (which I suspected all along) and that she needed to patch things up with me, for her own conscience. 

I ended up telling her that I still had feelings for her after the second time I thought her because I wanted her to know exactly where I stand. She said she needed time to herself but wants me around. I don't really blame her completely for what happened and I'm finding it impossible to move on. It's been 4 years since I've felt this way about anyone and I don't know what to do.

14364,Non-Romantic,2jjr4x,"Sorry this is a really long post as this problem has been around my whole life and it is a long explanation. For the lazy, I have included the TD;LR in the beginning of the post. 

**TL;DR:** *Mother has been a great cause of stress in my life and has caused a very unstable upbringing which now causes me great anxiety which I am dealing with. Feels like I can not handle having her in my life right now, so I have since blocked her number and deleted her from Facebook. But now I feel guilty because I am no longer there for my mom if she needs me.* 

From the beginning me and my mom have had a strange relationship. I grew up with my brother [Pat 28M] and she raised us as a single mom. I understand that it can be stressful to raise two kids on your own with very little funding, but I feel like some of her behavior is just unacceptable. 

My mom has always had a drinking problem, and with that came some major anger issues. She would often get angry at me and my brother for little to no reason at all. For example, if my mom couldn't find her car keys, she would start yelling at us for stealing her keys and would start throwing dishes around the house or heavy candles at the walls or us. Sometimes it seemed if you were in the house with her you could literally feel the anger from her in your bones!  My brother being 7 years older than me, was really good at trying to keep me out of harms way. If our mom was freaking out for whatever reason he would take me to the park or go play basketball with me.

I remember one time my mom was angry for some reason and my brother took me into his room and we hid behind the door so she couldn't get in. She decided it was a good idea to take the vacuum cleaner to try to tear down the door. 

Now I want to make it clear though that my mom isn't all bad, and maybe that's where my problems root from. She did take us to the mountains a lot as a kid and would be super caring and cuddly. It's just she would snap from one extreme to another. Many times not remembering what happened while she was angry and belligerent. It was also kind of confusing because her and my grandma would argue all the time. My grandma was an important factor in my life and always made sure that as a kid we always had a roof over our head and food on our plates. But my mom would constantly tell us that our grandma hated us and would tell her that we would end up in jail because we were bad kids. On the other side we were told by our grandmother that our mom was a bad mom and if she loved us that she would treat us better. As a little girl that can be really confusing to hear your family tell you such conflicting things. 
During this time we moved around almost every year due to our mother not paying rent. This made it really hard to maintain friendships. Luckily my grandma would take care of me in elementary during the week so I could go to the same school for the first 6 years. However I lacked in social skills so had a hard time making friends.

When I was 12 years old I ended up attempting suicide. I overdosed on a bunch of pills I found around the house. This was caused from both things inside the house, and major bullying I received in junior high. I ended up going into cardiac arrest 3 times on the way to the hospital. I ended up in a coma for 3 days and stayed in the Children's hospital for a few months in the psyche-ward for depression. During this time my mom was forced to go to anger management and ADAC. This kept in the sense that my mom didn't throw things at us anymore, but her behavior otherwise never changed. 

When I was 13 my brother moved out and joined the military. My mom became quite hostile to me as I was now the prime subject in the house. She would end up kicking me out every few weeks and leaving me to stay with either my grandparents or friends houses. During this time I was never forced or pushed to attend school. I ended up hanging out with the wrong crowd and started doing a lot of harsh drugs at only 13. My mom moved in with her then boyfriend who was extremely abusive towards her, me and his daughter would witness him hitting and raping my mom on multiple occasions. A little while after my mom and her boyfriend got evicted from our little acreage and ended up moving back to the city. The only thing is, they ended up moving into his moms apartment which was in a 18+ building, so I was not allowed to live there. My mom gave me a cell phone and basically told me to try to stay with friends or family. My sister in law at the time was now over 18 and living on her own. At the time my grandma and I were not on very good terms and I was not welcome there. I ended up couch surfing or finding just about anywhere to sleep. I wasn't even 14 at the time. 

During this time, one of my friends ended up telling everyone in our circle that I was making all of this up for attention and all of a sudden I was not welcome at any ones house. I ended up sleeping under stairwells in apartment buildings that weren't locked and slept in a few parks when it was nice out. I tried to find other people who were in my living perdiciment and ended up staying with this one homeless guy who actually ended up writing me a love song hahaha. During this time I used to go to raves and sell drugs to make money to eat. I also used to go to this one place downtown that gave away free ham and cheese sandwiches and juice boxes every day.  ANYWAYS, I'm going off track. Some thing bad happened to me during this time, my new friend ended up going to jail or something, he just disappeared an so I was now alone at nights. I went to this park where a lot of the druggie kids used to hangout to see if there was anywhere I could stay the night. No one was available, so I ended up asking this random person who looked young enough. He ended up getting me really high on crack and I ended up getting date raped. He was 46 (we will call him Butch) and my 14th birthday was in 2 weeks. This guy's roommate (we will call him tiny) got me into his room after to ask me what had happened. Butch had told Tiny that I was 18. I told Tiny(who was actually massive) what had happened and he promised me that he would get Butch back for that. He told me to come back on my birthday and he would make it up to me. I ended up going on my birthday to the house, I went with a Friend of mine so I would feel safer. Tiny ended up beating the living shit out of Butch and threw him over the bath tub rail, Butch ended up crawling to his bedroom afterwards. 

Eventually my mom ended up leaving her boyfriend (after 3 years) when I was 15 and ended up getting her own place again so I was no longer homeless. I ended up meeting my dad that year as well and he flew me out to meet him and his family. My dad ended up offering me to live with him for a bit across the country, all I needed to do was save up for the plane ticket. He knew how crazy my mom was. During the time I was saving up(I was working full time at Dairy Queen at the time) I ended up meeting my boyfriend at the time [18M]. This man ended up saving my life. 

My mom continued to be a wack job, and would wake me up at 1 am accusing me of whistling even though I was asleep and would kick me out. My boyfriend then let me move in with him on the other side of the city. This was the beginning of a wonderful thing. I was separated from my mom and all my bad influence friends and I finally had a stable roof over my house. I stopped doing drugs and drinking entirly. We were together for 4 years. My major night terrors and panic attacks which included kinetic hallucinations finally started to go away and I haven't been suicidal since. I ended up working full time and got my GED when I was 18. My relationship with my family got better and better the older I got. Even my relationship with my mom. Now I still had anxiety which was effecting me on a daily basis, but it seemed manageable. 

My boyfriend and I broke up when I was 19 years old, and I decided to go live with my mom again for the time being as I was working in retail and cost of living here is stupid. (BAD IDEA) Nothing was better and she was still loosing it, this time I was able to handle things a little bit better as I was older and more mature, and I had the mental capability of shutting her out or generally ignoring her when she was in one of these moods. During this time I was giving her 600.00/m which was half the rent + utilities. A year later I come home to my mom hammered and crying saying that she was 3 months behind rent and I should find a place to live. HOLY FUCK WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING?! was my reaction. Rent here is approx 1200 for a 1 bedroom basic apartment, I was making just 200 more than that a month. That time was very stressful. 

I ended up getting a better job for a telecommunications company and worked in their call center, I soon got promoted and am now working in their office resolving issues within their systems. I LOVE IT. My home life is stable, and I have my life under control. I still don't drink very often, if I do I might have one beer with dinner, and I have since quit drinking. I have also sought help for counseling and psychiatry for my anxiety and depression issues. I have found an amazing boyfriend who supports me in every way and helps me as best he can with my daily anxiety. During this time though my mom has since been evicted from her apartment, lost all my baby pictures and other sentimental items before I could get them. I called her landlord who agreed to give her a key to the storage unit he put her stuff in if she paid him 150.00/m for it. She got the key but lost it and denied it for months until it was too late to even get the stuff back because he threw it all out. She has called me telling me that she is being kicked out by her now boyfriend and is going to be sleeping on the streets, I started panicking and crying feeling helpless because I REFUSE to help her because I feel it is not my responsibility, only for her to call me to tell me Just kidding, we're okay now. 

I've just had enough of it! I'm finally getting my life together and I feel like I'm becoming quite successful, but I feel like the contact with her is just too much stress for me while I'm trying to heal from a life of hardship. The other part of me feels bad for blocking her number and removing her from Facebook because if something bad happens to her, I will never know. My boyfriend and brother tell me she doesn't deserve to be in my life, but they are both emotionally involved in it...

I have always loved reading and writing. It's been clear to me for a very long time that I can't do anything career-wise that doesn't involve both in at least some respect. I know it is not the most financially viable direction to take, but it gives me total satisfaction and I wouldn't want to do anything else.

I am a senior in a great program that focuses on both the creative and business sides of writing. I came into college dead-set on going straight into grad school after undergrad and getting my MFA (Master of Fine Arts) to teach creative writing as a college professor. I was obsessed with the idea. It seemed like the dream job to me and I was totally oblivious to all of the intricacies of MFA programs themselves and teaching.

---

When I started really doing my research, I realized how incredibly difficult it is to get into any MFA program (most accept between 5 and 15 students a year in each genre). This didn't necessarily dissuade me, just opened up my eyes a little bit. It was not until this year that I was able to fully grasp it all. Applications were due in December/January and I met with several professors to talk to them about the whole process. Last semester was extremely hard; I was so overwhelmed with stress that I didn't see how I could take the time and energy to apply to a bunch of selective colleges. Some teachers were very helpful. One essentially said to look at all kinds of programs, not just the top ones, and to focus on funding; he said it's not a good idea to pay to get a degree that doesn't guarantee very much. This made sense to me as another professor told me how difficult it was to get a creative-writing-teaching job. He had to move around his entire life constantly - moving to the program, moving to assistant teach, moving to teach full-time, etc. - which of course is a reality in academia but one I hadn't grasped. And every one of them pointed out that you don't have to be in an MFA program to keep writing and getting better. One also told me that if you go into one and you're not ready, you won't get as much as you could out of the experience. 

---

Those are just some of the reasons I decided I wasn't ready to apply this year. Another huge one? I don't even know if I WANT to teach. I love discussing literature and of course writing, but I don't know if I'd want to run a class. I'm realizing that I have other options to explore, so my plan is to continue on with my back-up experience (working in publishing &amp; grant writing) and then re-evaluate next December. If I hate everything I've exposed myself to, maybe then I'll really know teaching is the right thing for me. 

---

Sorry - anyway. I really regret ever telling any member of my family how badly I wanted to get into grad school. I was so in love with the allure of the great programs that I didn't see all of the realities, and none of them work in the field, so they just took everything I said and went with it. I used to think an MFA could set you up for life (naive I know!) and of course they think the same, now, no matter what I try to explain. And they are loving and supportive of my dreams, so a big one like this, they really try to back up. 

---

But now they all think I'm reneging on my plans, which I guess I am - but I think for good reason! I'm excited to explore all different paths. It's not as though I can't seek an MFA later in life. But they've been pressuring me to an extreme. My dad was incredibly disappointed when I told him I was going to wait at least a year to apply. One sister has been sending me links to programs in Europe and pushing me very hard to stay on top of this/commit to this goal. But I don't have this ONE goal anymore! I feel like I have several. And another sister pointed out that I did this before - citing the time when I was EIGHT and desperate to climb Mt. Everest. She said I went gave up on that dream and it'd break her heart to see me give up on this, too. (?!)

---

Any idea how I can approach this? I wish my whole family could just sit down with my professors and have it all explained to them why the degree doesn't guarantee anything. They think it is similar to other fields in that the higher degree promises more money, more job options, etc. The MFA is very different - pretty much the opposite here. 

---

I've tried explaining everything my teachers have told me, even reading them things off websites and this guide my professor gave me. But they just see it as me giving up on myself. I don't think I am! I still want to get it someday, but now I might want to do it differently. I like the idea of getting a job and going to school nights. I like the idea of giving myself a year to really think about it. I'm enjoying so many other aspects of my life right now, I don't want to put myself into a corner (and all of this doesn't even mention how little of a chance I have getting in ever!) 

I have started to establish a life. I have a boyfriend of 3 years, friends from home, friends from college - and I love the place I'm living. My sister sending me links to colleges in Europe is just bumming me out. I feel like none of them take the other parts of my life seriously. This particular sister regrets a lot of the decisions that she made revolving around her own boyfriend (now husband) and I think she pushes me too much because she's afraid I'll make the same dependent mistakes. But I didn't make this decision because of the boyfriend. He was willing to follow me wherever if I even did get in somewhere. I made the choice for ME but everyone makes me feel like I should be doubting myself.

Ugh. Any advice? I know it's sort of specific but I was thinking people could relate/help me out. All of this is just extra stress. And I hate that they're all so obviously disappointed in me. Shit, even if I apply next fall, that's only 8 months away - why is it such a big deal that I wanted to wait?? I get that they're concerned for my future, but I don't think they understand it. I think I've done a good job setting myself up in other regards. I have a few job offers lined up. Sure, they're low pay, but I've been independent all these years and save and budget well. I think they're just hung up on my 'dreams' and I'm hung up on disappointing them. I'm just so confused because it's not as if I'm giving up what I'm passionate about at all. I'm just integrating it into my life in different ways.

All of this has made me question my decision (too late, sure, but still) and make me worried for next year. What if I fall in love with whatever job I'm in and don't want to apply next year, either? What if I move and love where I'm living?

If there is any reassurance anyone can offer, I would really appreciate that too.

Essentially, my family went through some real financial hell as my parents lost all of their life savings (at minimum, high six-figure sum...). My parents aren't involving me too much, most likely to keep me at low-stress as I'm dealing with undergraduate and graduate work, so all I know is that it was most likely stolen, BUT it is looking very good at getting it back. The problem is when. 

I have an extremely good friend, who I'll name Friend. Friend's financial life has not been good. From what I know, his family is in lots of debt from paying college for him and his siblings, and although they all work, it's minimal help. None of his siblings are out of school, and he is also getting into graduate school, so while he has a job, it's only enough for himself and his loans. They do get the bills paid and there's food on the table, though. But they've had to cut back really hard. We go to a very good school, where the tuition is supposedly worth it (extremely high), and his parents pushed him to go and agreed to help him pay for it. I was just lucky enough that my family could afford tuition. 

Normally, I don't know anyone's financial issues. But since Friend has really been my best friend for way over a decade, in a low point, he came to me to rant about his financial issues. When this issue happened, I had to confide in someone, and I confided in Friend. My parents were losing their sanity when they found out all of their money was just gone and I let it out on Friend, who listened. 

My aunt and my dad (blood siblings) have always been very close. While my family has been doing financially decent, my aunt and her husband are very well off. My aunt was the first to hear of my parent's issue. I don't know if I was supposed to know, but this was the first argument I've ever heard my dad and aunt have. From what I know, she'll be paying my and my sibling's college tuition and housing/boarding, along with many of their bills, and wrote us a fairly large check to keep us afloat (she argued she wanted to do this, my dad refused, but eventually accepted). She does live nearby so she will keep an eye on us until everything is okay. 

I ended up confiding in Friend (which I really shouldn't have). He has meant my aunt plenty of times before, so they're acquainted. Our families aren't so close, it's just him and I. He's stayed over at my house plenty of times. While I told him what my aunt did, he didn't really say anything and was more listening than anything, so I don't know how he immediately felt. It's not until afterwards I realized how douchey it was - that my family's financial burden was magically fixed right away and I was telling my friend all about it, while he was in a bad situation himself. 

A few weeks later my parents confronted me about what the hell did Friend do; they told me that Friend asked Aunt for money. I don't know the conversation, but basically Aunt said no. Knowing her, she definitely let him down very easily. Aunt called my parents, presumably asking WTF and they asked me. I told them I have absolutely no idea why he did it and that I did NOT put him up to it. The only thing I could admit to was that he knew what was going on with our personal problems. Essentially, Aunt felt unbearably uncomfortable with the situation and is now feeling a lot of guilt and that I need to apologize to her for what happened. 
   

I called Friend right away asking him what the hell was going on, and he only yelled at me that I didn't understand. I hard pressed him asking if he really was in a worse position than I thought, but he said no, but it wasn't fair that my family got relief and that my family's always had life easy, and his family deserves help too as they're good people. It's true his family is great, but I don't know what to say or do. He says the amount of debt his family is in is hardly worth $10 in my aunt's eyes so it should be easy for her. 

So what the hell do I say? Where do I begin? I don't think he'll ask her again but I have no idea. How can I help him? DO I help him? What do I tell my aunt and my parents? 

**tl;dr**: My friend went to my aunt asking for money to help his own family's financial burden after my aunt is donating large amounts of money to my family for help. I have NO idea how to handle this situation. I just want to help everyone. 

EDIT: Apologies are a given - I'm going to apologize, I'm going to get him to apologize, but what else can I do? What can I say to him that can help him? I've known him since elementary, I will not dump him after this, no matter how shitty it is that he did this, I'm sure it was an act out of emotion. But what else can I say/do to get through this issue and end it happily? Also, do I tell his parents if they don't already know?

**Some Background**

My SO and I have been together for 5 years. We met at the start of university as we were both on similar courses, and have stayed together since. I'm not going to sit here and say our relationship is perfect. It isn't. We do fight, although not often, and we work at this every day. We share opinions on every major aspect of our future - we both want to get married, likely in May 2017, we both want 2-3 children, we are both pet lovers and want to get a couple of dogs when we settle down. Neither of us are religious, although my SO was raised in a Christian household - we both identify as atheist, although I believe more strongly in the idea of God. We are both fairly individual, we have separate hobbies and interests, and we both enjoy a good debate about politics and other issues - that is to say, we don't share the same opinion on *everything*. 



We moved in together after 8 months of dating, and after living together for 6 months or so, decided to take a step back and live separately for a while. I did a placement year in uni, and got myself my own place. He lived in a house share for a year and then moved in to my place after that. We have been happily living in that same place for almost 2 years, at which point, I got a graduate job in Manchester (currently in London), and we moved in with my parents for a month, so that we could save money for the move. 



A little about my SO before I can continue - I love him. Absolutely, 1000%. He is handsome, shares my sense of humour, takes amazing care of me and puts up with my shit. He is intelligent and challenges me intellectually constantly, and we work out together, so he pushes me to be physically better too. He is so fun to be around, makes me feel lighter than air, and we enjoy each other's company immensely. So much so,we have had no problems sharing my tiny bedroom at my parents place for a month, we just work around and with each other really well. 



The problem here: he has been depressed and is still suffering from its effects. He takes meds, and he is doing really well, but it has both been caused by, and has affected his degree. He changed his degree after second year (when we stopped living together for a while) to something slightly different in an attempt to handle it, but this clearly didn't help as he then had to retake his final year. He hadn't finished his dissertation on time and he decided to retake two modules alongside the dissertation in an attempt to finish what he started. 


Now, results day has come round and he failed both modules, and hasn't finished his dissertation. I got what I needed to start my career, but he didn't, and he is therefore still working towards that. It was a joint decision, and the result was that he was prepared to give this one more try. He is determined, but also lazy, but I believe him when he says he will do it this time. It's shit or get off the pot at this point. And he knows that. 


I think this has always been a fundamental difference in our characters. I have know what I want to do for a while now, and I went for it. When it mattered, I pushed myself, and it paid off. He has never really known, nor cared what he wanted to do in the future, he's more of a day to day time. I love this about him. I need someone to keep me on the ground and ultimately someone who can pull me back to the present and stop me worrying needlessly. I've told him from day one, I don't care where he works, what he does for a living, so long as he can afford to pay his share of our living costs. When he was really struggling with uni, I suggested that he stops putting pressure on himself and putting himself in needless debt, and instead of plowing through, go and find something he actually wants to do. He decided to keep going, and I'm proud that he tried. I've always done my best not to influence his path or make him feel pressured into something he hates. Depression is real and scary, and I don't want him to suffer because he feels the need to provide for me or be a success. I truely feel that success is measured happiness, and I certainly don't need someone to provide for me in life. I just want a happy partner. 


That's a whole lot of background, so if you're still with me, you're a really good person. 


**The issue**

We are both poor. We haven't really got the means to move, but living outside of London is much better for my career and just financially in general. We will have when I get settled in my job, and I will support my SO until he settles too. However to move, we need to pay a deposit and first months rent, which neither of us can afford. 


My parents offered to pay for the set up, so that we wouldn't have to struggle. They are both pretty judgemental, angry and difficult people, but I love them anyway. They have been helpful so far, but my mother keeps bringing up how much money they are lending us. I know it's a lot, that's not the issue. It's that they are lending it to *us*. They have loved my SO from day one, but are all of a sudden concerned about him and have begun criticising everything about him. It's because I'm moving with him when he doesn't also have a full time job, they keep saying he Will drag me back and he is a burden. They even said that they would be happy to lend me the money if I was the only one moving, but since we both are, they think he should pay his own way or borrow money from his own parents (who would probably lend it if he asked, which in itself is another issue - his parents haven't offered to help with the move or even thank my parents for housing him, and that upsets my parents).



I actually see where they are coming from, but we are planning to pay them back ourselves as soon as we can. We'd be borrowing £1500 for the move, and with my new salary we could pay this back in 3 months if we tried, maybe even less. I don't feel comfortable borrowing money from his side of the family as its my fault we're moving, and he is uprooting his life to come with me. We can support ourselves while we are there, even if my wage pays for most things ( we haven't really thought in terms of his and my money for a long time) and he will be working part time until he has (hopefully) obtained his degree and can find full time work that makes him happy. 


As I mentioned before, we are living with my parents. They have recently started complaining to me about how he is around the house. We are not supposed to come downstairs after 10pm as it disturbs my parents, and they have set many other rules such as we should be up by 9am, every day, we should make sure we are ready for bed before they come up to bed themselves, we have to plan our day around them (we can't use the water/bathroom while they are meant to be getting ready for work or whatever. This and other things are why I moved out in the first place, and I *hate* that we have to be here. 


Anyway, they started complaining, because he dozed off on the sofa and because he didn't iron his shirt before work and he walked around without a top on this morning. They claimed he doesn't cook (he isn't allowed to cook for all of us, just me and my brother. Which he does. Often) and he doesn't clean (he does our washing, the dishes, and more often than not cleans up after himself. Just like the rest of us) and he doesn't talk much (this one annoys me the most, as he does talk, he just doesn't talk about what *they* want to talk about. And they also says he doesn't buy stuff (he pays for everything for my brother and I, to the point it annoys me since I like paying my half).


They keep using this as examples of how he's holding me back and how he needs to change, and they keep saying we will crash and burn and we aren't going to last. I am furious with them as I think it's none of their business and even if it was, they know **nothing** about my relationship at all. 


I feel like I'm stuck here, since I now need to keep the peace between them till we move, and I'm so stressed out as to how we can afford the move without their help since they clearly can't help me without being rude and making me feel guilty for not having the perfect (in their eyes) partner. What do I do? How can I mediate in this situation? Should I just grin and bear it, or should I stand up for my partner?

I don't feel comfortable about this, especially since men of the cloth aren't held in high regard in our area, the local one's been nicknamed a sinister minister by people in our town (a sinister minister's a morally bankrupt clergyman, basically!) and no-one really likes him.

My mother in law expects all of her children to be present for every holiday. On the 2 occasions that my husband decided to go to something with my family it blew up entirely and she went off telling him how he isn't acting like a part of the family and how everyone misses him etc etc. His siblings also join in, he has 4 siblings who always make it to every holiday and also can't understand the thought of my husband choosing to see my family instead of his own. It always bothered me a little that he couldn't attend any holidays with my family but I just let it go and we either celebrate with his family together or we seperate because I alternate being with his family and my own. Our families live in opposite directions so going to both every year on every holiday isn't an option because it will make things too hectic and make us dread the holidays more than I already have recently because of this problem. 

So now that I have a daughter things are worse. She now expects my husband and our daughter to attend every holiday with or without me. My husband has made it very clear to her that our daughter has to see my family on the holidays too and that he will be going wherever she goes as well. So she went on about how we will just need to visit everyone then because she will not have her son and grandchildren missing any holidays in her home because family is family and that is what holidays are for.

So we ignored her tantrum and made a holiday schedule and told her that we were sticking to it. Here is the schedule:

 We will be alternating Thanksgiving every year so one year we will go to my moms, the next will be his parents, the next will be my mom, and then back to his parents. So we will be at his parents every other year for thanksgiving. Christmas day will always be at his parents house because my family celebrates only on christmas eve while his family celebrates Christmas day so no problems there. Easter will be at my grandmothers every year we will not be attending his family's Easter because my grandmother begged to have a holiday with us and Easter is her favorite. Now every other holiday like Memorial Day, 4th of July, New Years, etc will all be at his parents always. 

So this past year we started off with my family for Thanksgiving. Things blew up big time. His mom sent endless texts to my husband about how him and our daughter will be attending every single holiday from that point on period end of discussion. And about how he never acts like he is part of the family, how he needs to be a man and put his own family before my family who is not blood. Then his siblings went on Facebook and started tagging him in posts about how they lost a brother. It was a huge frustrating nightmare which actually led to us deleting Facebook. Christmas comes around and all is well. Then Easter comes around and leading up to Easter he made it very clear we would not be attending and she just kept saying Oh yes you are. and of course things blew up again that night after we really didn't attend. 

Finally Mother's Day approaches and my husband, the baby, and I all come down with a really bad stomach virus. He explains to her that we won't be able to make it because we are extremely sick. Things blow up again of course. I really need this to stop. Am I being unreasonable because I just want my daughter to be able to be with my family on the holidays sometimes? His family has every single holiday to themselves besides Easter and Thanksgiving but that is not enough for them. They are really stressing me out and they have done a great job at making me hate the holidays. What can I or my husband do to make them understand? Or was dividing the holidays up the wrong thing to do? 

I also want to make it clear that his family gets to see him and the baby often. They visit us or we visit them very frequently. But I feel like my husband and baby could live in thier house and if he were to leave on a holiday it would cause the same reaction. She has also told my husband to not even think of trying to show up without the baby.

Jen and I have been really close friends since we met in high school, and I would say she has become my best friend.  We share interests and do loads of fun things together, both going out and staying in, and we openly discuss our dating stories, work and family issues, etc.  I'd say until now it was a pretty healthy friendship, and I even moved into an apartment in her complex because we thought it would be cool to be so convenient to each other.

Anyway, after a messy divorce at 20, she has been dating for about two years now.  She has made some neat friends along the way, and some of them have become my friends as well.  One friend, Robert, definitely didn't work out romantically after they went on several dates, but it's clear that he's still very fond of her.  He still texts her quite a bit, and she's recently gotten somewhat annoyed by it.  This becomes important soon.

Another friend, Adam, she met through OKCupid almost a year ago.  They went on a couple of dates, but he let her know that he is polyamorous, and she doesn't dig that, so they stopped the dating but continued to hook up occasionally.  After a bit of that, she met Adam's best friend and grew to like him, and the casual sex fizzled out.  She pursued him for awhile and has continued dating new people, blah blah blah.

Months and months later, I saw Adam at a party, and he invited me out for drinks sometime.  We ended up going to a small concert a few nights later and went to his place afterward.  We had sex, it was fun, and then I went home.  No huge story here.

Maybe a week later, I let Jen know that Adam and I had hooked up.  She didn't seem thrilled with it but assured me that her crush was long over and that it didn't surprise her as he is a bit of a slut.  Okay, cool.  We were walking through the grocery store, and Robert starts texting her.  She complains, so I offer to text him instead and kind of distract him.  She seems pleased with this, so he and I chat some.  Fast forward to a few nights later at Jen's place, and in casual conversation, I mention something funny that Robert had texted me.  SHE LOST HER MIND.

She freaked out on me, accusing of stealing all the guys in her life.  I ask her to slow down, but she's wild at this point.  How dare I sleep with Adam when I knew she liked him so much and would have still been with him if he were monogamous, and now I'm flirting and texting with Robert, the nerve!  I tried to explain myself (not that I really had anything to defend, especially in regards to Robert), but she would have none of it.

Two nights later, I got a phone call from Adam.  After I answer and we exchange how are yous, he asks straight away if I have any STDs.  Um, excuse me?  I say no, I have been tested recently and can share my results if he'd like.  He calms down and says he understands that we used a condom but wanted to be extra careful.  I told him he's obviously welcome to get tested himself but that I'm sure I'm clean.  He then lets me know that Jen had texted him, out of nowhere, something along the lines of You should get yourself tested.  Friendsthrow1 gets around.  I apologize that he was dragged into any drama, and he told me that it was okay but that he'd probably stop talking to both of us for some time.  It hurt, but I got it.

So, Redditors, I haven't attempted to contact Jen since she went crazy on me.  I figure she needs her space, but at this point, I wonder if it's worth trying to go back to normal.  I mean, we've had a long, enjoyable friendship full of awesome memories, but holy shit, you know?  Am I in the wrong here?  Is it a no-no to sleep with former dates of a close friend?  Maybe we have different values there, and maybe I should have thought to ask before accepting the date.  However, I don't feel I did -anything- wrong by texting with Robert.  Help?!

In July, she finally turned 20 but my parents, still under the impression that she was a year older, believed she turned 21.

I told my girlfriend before the party that they all thought she was 21 so she went along with it all day.

I have two younger siblings and normally I get along with them. My sister is 16 and my brother is 14. 

My sister has a new friend who she is really tight with, despite them only knowing each other a year. Her friend is extremely good-looking and knows it - please don't take that for me expressing interest in her, this is just a fact. I would not want to date a 16yo, I have a 16yo sister so I'm quite familiar with the age gap. That said, she wear clothes that flaunt her figure and poses in ways so that her shirt is always falling open, etc. Before all this, I would sometimes admire the view, but I was careful not to do it when anyone was looking and stoppe dmyself when I caught myself. 

She will try to spend time with me alone in a room, which I wasn't as careful about to begin with (remember - my sister is 16, so I still think of her as a kid, so I wasn't like oh crap this girl is coming on to me). I'm a pretty awkward guy too so I didn't pick up on anything.

Apparently, sister's friend told sister that I've been harassing her and assaulting her. They both called me a creep for a few days. This is untrue. Sister bought it hook line and sinker, and now they're complaining to my parents that I am always staring and leering and creeping around when she's over. They talk about how creepy my behavior is. Again, this is untrue, and she is always over so of course I'm going to run into her a lot.

I'm going to do my best to explain my mom's situation, but I only know what she tells me and there are things I don't quite understand.  I'm using a throwaway for the sake of anonymity.  

Basically, my single, 55 year-old mother has health issues and is no longer able to work. She has been out of work due to said issues for over 3 years and has been living with her sister during this time. Prior to that, she lost her home due to foreclosure. She has no savings, no insurance, no property, and is living off of the kindness of her sister and $150 monthly, which she receives from her retirement fund. From age 16 to age 52 she worked and paid into the Social Security system.

The biggest health issue which does not allow her to work is a neck injury. She was hit by a drunk driver at 21 years old, sustaining an injury which has gotten progressively worse with age. Cue aggravations of that old injury in the form of getting rear-ended on the highway, then a first aid training session at her last job. Now the herniated discs, bone spurs, and pinched nerves are too disabling to allow her to work, and she lost her last job precisely because of that. She says that in addition to pain, the injury causes her arm weakness and numbness, so doing even the simplest tasks becomes difficult, if not impossible.

She has a multitude of other health problems, chiefly migraine, hormone issues, prescription drug withdrawal, depression, and anxiety. She used to attend counseling twice a week and took medications prescribed by a psychiatrist, but since losing her job she has not been attending counseling. She had been continuing the meds, which they recently cut her off from, and now experiences withdrawal symptoms. This resulted in a recent ER visit. She tells me that she is suicidal. 

For the past 2 years she has been applying for Social Security Disability benefits. She is using a lawyer for her application, which has been denied once. They are appealing but it is taking a very long time and hope is waning. She also brought up suit against her previous employer due to the workplace injury which aggravated her condition, but that seems to be going nowhere. She tells me she is applying for food stamps.

So, she is obviously frustrated with the whole show:  living in pain and on a pittance, not welcome anymore at her sister’s house, no way to even try working to support herself (SSD claim and workplace injury lawsuit), and fucked up mental health issues to top it all off.  

Did I mention that I have been living abroad for the past 7 years? Oh, and I'm an only child. Say what you will, but to tell truth I tried to go back and live with her for 3 months and just about went nuts.  I may not be the most mentally unstable person, but put me in a room with her and believe me, my cracks start showing. 

I'm unmarried (but in a relationship), childless, and making just enough to get by. Still paying off student loans, although not a huge amount. I live with my partner and his family, in a developing country. I have started a small business which has potential to grow, but I need to stay in this region for that to happen. Not to mention invest more capital into the business. 

Any suggestions, fellow Redditors? I really don’t want to go back to the US to live at this time. Bringing my mom to a country with sub par medical services and which speaks a language that she doesn’t seems like a bad idea as well. First and foremost, I think her mental health issues have to be addressed. I am worried about her. This lady supported me as a single mother and it's sad to see what working all those years has gotten her.

Any ideas which you could give me will be taken into consideration. Please help! And thank you!

My friend is a 21 year old male and his girlfriend is also 21. They've been dating since highscool. It's the only relationship he's ever been in so not only is it hard to leave am abusive relationship but it's all he knows.

His girlfriend is both mentally and emotionally abusive towards him. I'm not sure if she is physically abusive towards him as well. She hides it pretty well from most people but she already knows that me and a few of his close friends hate her and know what she's like so she's pretty much just openly abusive towards him in front of us.

She insults him and calls him name (in front of other people) all the time. She screams at him when he doesn't finish her photography work or home work for her on time. Most of the time she tries to prevent him from hanging out with his friends.

In the past we went about this pretty badly 3 of us were all drunk with them and we just said all the horrible things she does to their faces. While also insulting her.

14535,Non-Romantic,2ib65q,"Hello. I work in a small and high-pressure environment. My job involves a LOT of multitasking, deadlines, and intense attention to detail. I've been there for 1 year as of last week. Administrative staff are supposed to be 4 people, with my supervisor(let's call her M) as office manager/head accountant/occasional IT. However, 2 of those 4 left about 6 months ago, and they fired the last 1 who wasn't me a month ago. And they've had trouble holding onto employees during that 6 month period, with a revolving door of temps in the interim. Right now, I'm the only permanent employee who's been working there for more than 3 weeks, working directly under M.

As you might imagine, a lot of responsibilities have been placed on me for a sustained period of time, and it's been really grueling. I will admit that I am a human being, and I've made mistakes. Some big, some small, although it's been a little while since I made a made a really big mistake (e.g. one that involves calling a client and making them potentially upset, or compromises a major deal). I like the work and the non-admin office members on the whole, although they haven't raised my pay in the year, and I make 4-5 dollars less than would merit for my job title in my city.

So that's where this is. But working with M is a total nightmare. She has never once told me good work or good job. She micromanages me like I've never experienced before. Rarely does she explicitly ask me for a report on what projects I'm working on in a day, but she seems to get really upset if I don't tell her of my own volition, daily. Granted, she will tell me to fasttrack project X over project Y, but I'm pretty ok and getting better at deciding these things on their own, especially because she often won't listen if I explain complications. 

There's a really nasty side to her, too. About 50% of the time that I ask her a question about how to do/handle things, she will respond really angrily and with a harsh tone (e.g. You should know this, Use your head, this isn't hard, Really? Really?). She has berated me for mistakes minor and major in front of other permanent employees and temps (a recent one was that I didn't ask a job candidate if she wanted to hang up her jacket.) She doesn't berate me in front of non-admin staff, but only in front of other admin staff or temps. 

I've been told that she does this with all employees, and I've seen and heard her do it to others in front of me. Despite the fact that I am doing the work of 2-3.5 people over this summer, she is really stingy about overtime, refusing to grant me more than an extra 5-10 hours each week. She gives me inconsistent feedback on what I should do differently, and doesn't respond well when I gently point out that it doesn't mesh with prior advice. I cannot count the number of times I have cried about things she has said in the bathroom, to other employees when they were working there, and to friends, family, and my SO. I feel really hurt, and less confident in myself whenever she treats me the ways that she does

When I have asked her if she would rather I do things more like x or like y (e.g. work faster vs pay more attention to detail on projects) she has hemmed and hawwed and implied that it won't be a problem if I keep working. When I asked her if she would rather I ask her questions in writing, she refused. When I asked her if she would like to set an office hours time in which I could approach her with questions, she refused. 

When I told her that it's hard for me to ask questions when I feel like I need to have researched every memo and prior example, asked other employees, and otherwise am forced to ask her, she blew it off. I've told her several times that I am having trouble handling the volume of my work, but she told me that I don't work fast enough, and that I should just get over it, she'll hire more people eventually. 

I don't think any of her bosses and the non-admin staff know what's going on, or if they know and don't care. I'm supposed to work for her and not for them, anyway, even if none of them have had ongoing complaints about my work (I feel like she would have told me if they did). Some have made supportive comments about how they appreciate my work and understand that I'm not in an easy situation, which makes me feel better than I could describe.

Last week things came to a head when a mistake (seemed major at the time, is less and less major when I told friends and family, and looking back on it) came to light. It's on an ongoing, difficult project that is normally handled by 3 people, but has been only me for the past 5 months. I was crying in her office, and she told me outright that I didn't seem happy and that she thought I should quit, that she would help proofread my resume and help me apply to jobs. 

I said at the time that there are things I don't like about the work and that it would be nice to have more help from her, but didn't come out and say that she was the only real thing I hate about working there. She also told me that she hates her job, which is something I guess? It cleared the air, but didn't prevent her from being shitty again two days later and this week.

 Other employees have encouraged me to talk more about my private life to her. She was really nice and understanding when I broke up with my SO. This is difficult for me on the whole, partially because I don't like talking about my private life, especially with people who berate my daily. I prefer talking about books, movies, music, and ideas, but she doesn't go to movies, read books, listen to music, and doesn't have any hobbies as far as I can tell. 

She likes to gossip and talk shit about the non-admin staff. I almost never start, and never really respond to her attempts with more than that's awful!, oh my goodness!, I'm really sorry you have to go through that etc. As far as I can tell (and from office gossip), she has a really barren personal life, her marriage is falling apart, and both of her parents died in the last year. But it's not like I've had an easy year either, and I try to be professional and kind to her and others. Gossip also holds that she is held to impossible standards and is micromanaged by her bosses, but she's never told me about any of this.

Literally everybody I've talked to about this tells me that I'm in a horrible situation and should get out, which has helped me a lot. I guess I wouldn't mind some insight on what the dynamic might be from other people. And if anybody has advice on how I could handle things while I look for other jobs, that would be greatly appreciated. My confrontation skills are really poor in general. An unfortunate number of people have cycled through my life who gaslighted, manipulated and put me down. But they're gone now, and I'm trying to get better. I try to find the humanity and goodness in everybody, but it's harder to do so with her than anybody else that I've ever met.

This past summer I had been seeing a coworker. Things were going well for about a few months. We spoke to each other every day, we seemed to have a lot in common, our sex was amazing (he's the first person I had sex with). My last and only relationship ended years ago, so it was nice to find something like this. At the end of the summer, I had to go back to school and he had to go back to school as well (he returned to his alma mater to work on his master's degree and is working there as a teaching fellow). I think the distance between us put a fair amount of strain on things. We were arguing all the time. There was a general lack of effective communication between the two of us, which has a lot to do with his severe drinking issues. There were a lot of misinterpretations about our relationship and we had trouble talking things through.

For awhile I pushed for a relationship because I thought it's what I wanted, but it ended up just pushing him away from me. I was unable to decide whether I really wanted to be with him, or if it was just the sex I wanted, or what. But I think I was just so scared to lose him at that point that anything seemed appealing. I had to come to terms with the fact that a relationship between us just wouldn't work out. I still find it difficult to accept that at times, mostly because I got used to blaming myself for things between us failing. But regardless, I decided to try pursing a friendship because I'm tired of things being bitter between us.

He told me a few weeks back that he wanted me to know that he would be very busy for the remainder of the semester. He had to grade final papers and had a very large work load for his class. So I tried not to smother him with texts. I texted him a few times to say happy thanksgiving and things along those lines. We talked here and there throughout the past few weeks and managed to have some normal conversations (but mostly when he's been drinking). I mentioned that if he wanted to hang out, I could bring a game over to his place and he said that sounded like fun.

I understand he's been busy so I haven't been taking the lack of communication to heart or expecting much. But, the thing that bothers me is his mixed messages.
We have to work together, and since our relationship went south, he said he wouldn't be a jerk to me at work to spare us from awkwardness. I see him joking around with our coworkers which includes my sister, but contrary to what he said, he's been so cold and condescending towards me. I try to be kind but I feel like I can't even make casual conversation with him in person. He's making our work environment incredibly uncomfortable by his behavior. It bothers me that he can casually text me when it's convenient for him, and then he acts the way he does at work.

I've been thinking of just giving him some time (which is way more than he deserves really) but at this point, it seems like all of this is just a red flag and a sign to go NC.

Anyways, i asked her if she was dating him, just a single simple question. she went fucking ballistic and pretty much tried to rip me a new one via text. Angry texts flying in left and right every few minutes. She said some pretty fucked up stuff like hoping to develop feelings for him to spite me, I'm not yours to worry about, insulting my mom(real mature there lol), blaming me for harming her mental stability, etc.

I'm perfectly fine despite her doing all this, which i think is pissing her off more. I was continuing to text her until I get the old I need time text.

This is a complete 180 from who she normally is and last time she and this guy were together, I didn't hear from her for months until he broke up with her. She has NEVER gone off on me like this before and is not crazy as the situation makes her seem to be.

What the actual fuck is going on?!? Honestly, I'm thinking drugs because this guy is kind of sketchy. I have only met him once after practically forcing her to let me meet him. As far as I know, he grew up a snotty rich kid and absolutely dispises overweight people; so naturally he drove her to near anorexia last time.

My sister said I should just ignore her until she gets over herself, but I care about her far to much to leave her alone with this guy.

14564,Non-Romantic,36ueh6,"Hi /r/Relationships, I am using a throwaway account. Long time lurker, first-time poster, etc. I hope I am following the rules for posting, but if not, please tell me.

I am in college on a full-ride scholarship so there is no need for me to take out any sort of loans for any reason but I have the option to. My sister is successful and makes 6-figures. However, to get to that place, she also had to take out a lot of school loans (&gt; $150,000). 

My sister has been asking me to take out small federal subsidized loans around $5000 because I won't get any interest on them until after graduation, but she promises to pay back before then. However, I do not trust her. I recently found out that my mom gave her $10,000 to offset the interest and pay back her debt faster but she used it instead on her boyfriend's loans. He has more loans than she does. My mom was extremely angry at her, especially since we are not well-off ourselves, but there was not much my mom could do at that point. Also, she has borrowed from other people, such as my other sister, but took years to pay back and it was a very small amount. 

My sister and I are not particularly close. We don't share feelings or have deep conversations. She is very dismissive of everyone else's feelings and her language can be very vitriolic especially if you don't agree with her opinions. Growing up, our relationship was tumultuous. She could be very kind and loving one moment and screaming insults at me for hours the next. I am very sensitive to it but I am also a very passive person and do not like confrontation,so I just stay silent while she rages and yells. This has allowed us to coexist. 

She currently lives at home with my parents to save money to pay back her loans. She has never missed a payment of any sort, but she also lives paycheck by paycheck because she enjoys luxurious items such as brand-name clothing and also has to make huge payments on her loans.

To the present, she has asked me to take out loans. I do not feel comfortable doing so. If I say no, she will hold a grudge and take every opportunity to make snide remarks and just be plain mean when I come home (I am away for college). I have been getting therapy dealing with problems that stem from her treatment of me as a child and I feel that if I return, the problems and feelings I have will come back.  My parents are clueless and are under the impression that my sister and I are extremely close. Also, I can't speak our native language as well as my older sister, so she has always been able to explain herself and turn me into the enemy in their eyes when things got wrong. I do not want to see my sister if she will act this way just because I said no. But I love parents and want to see them and do not want them have to deal with our conflicts and shatter their image of a perfect family. Also, they will not kick her out or anything. I asked my other sister (23) what I should do and she told me to just say no. When I asked her how to deal our oldest sister in the aftermath, she doesn't give me a response. She knows how our oldest sister can be and has witness our oldest sister treatment of me when we were younger. I feel like I am having to choose to pick between my sanity and seeing my parents whom I love my very much. Also, it is my neck on the line because those loans will be in my name. What should I do? I have resolved to say no, but I do not know how to act or what to say when she verbally attacks me. I am afraid I will shut down like I always have when does that and have never stood up for myself.

She is currently borrowing a couple grand from me and wants more on top of that.

**tl;dr**: My sister wants me to take out school loans and give them to her so that she can pay back her loans faster. I do not want to but have never stood up to her before. If I say no, she will make my life a nightmare while I'm visiting home. I want to see my parents but I do not want to deal with her. 

EDIT 1: Maybe I didn't phrase it very well, but my question isn't whether or not I should give her the loan. I have already decided not to as I stated above. My question was to how to deal with her because if I want to visit my parents and do things with them, I would have to face her as well. It's difficult standing up to someone who has been verbally abusive to you multiple times for a long period of time.

14583,Non-Romantic,2bdteq,"She knows the relationship is abusive.  According to her he only hits her once a year or so and only when he's been drinking really hard.  Hrm. 

 It's not even the physical abuse that worries me, though.  She has bipolar disorder and is not taking her meds, trying to develop her own coping mechanisms rather than relying on chemicals she feels are having negative effects on her body.  I am not a doctor and I do not give her advice about whether or not to take medication, but her doctor does seem to be supportive of her decision and for the most part it's going pretty well.  Except for her boyfriend.  He has very low self-esteem and instead of working on his own issues, he seems to just want to make sure she feels as bad as he does all the time.  Every time it looks like she's making progress, she'll show up all tearful because of something her douchebag boyfriend said or did which makes her feel worthless and sets her back enormously.

Now, I'm frustrated.  I will not push her to break up with him - I've made it clear that I think she should end the relationship, but I don't want to press her too hard to the point she feels ashamed and stops talking to me about it at all.  She has said numerous times that she doesn't want to break up with him because they have a lot of history and he stuck by her at a point when (she claims) she was the one being the ass-hole in the relationship so she feels like it wouldn't be fair to abandon him now.  

Just recently, he had one of his episodes and screamed at her and broke up with her.  She showed up to work in tears, and we all rallied with words of support and encouragement.  We were all like finally, she's free of him. We all were happy to cover for her so she could leave work early and get her stuff out of his house.  However, when offered help getting said stuff she deflected with sayings like I don't know if I can handle that right now and it won't all fit in my car.  And by the next day she was back to talking like they were still in a relationship and none of that had even happened.  It's her life and I actually do understand the fear she feels at leaving something so familiar to her even if it is a destructive force, but she has an excellent support network right now.  All of her friends have made it clear that we are essentially on call for her should she need help with anything. So now we get down to the meat of the issue:

She is in an abusive relationship.  She acknowledges this.  She confides in her friends and coworkers about it. However, she refuses to take steps to manage the situation. So now I am unsure if she's telling me about what's going on with her because she wants help getting out or because she just wants attention. I don't want to push her because when I do give her the old I think you should break up with him prod, I can physically see her begin to shut me out.  But I don't want to let it go and wake up one morning and find out she's in the hospital or dead (unlikely but with drunken rages you never really know).

TLDR: How do you tell whether someone is asking for your help or just wants your attention? How do you help them anyway without pushing them too much? Can you help someone who isn't ready to help themselves?

14619,Non-Romantic,3dh4ep,"I'm not even really sure where to start, Reddit. My Dad LOVES to argue, and I do believe that a good debate every so often can be intriguing, but the last few years it has gotten to be nothing short of completely intolerable.

For starters, he picks arguments with my brother and I nearly every day, or at least a few times a week. The things he argues about with us, in my opinion, are not worth getting so upset about. He just seems to take all his anger out on us.

It's like he is perpetually upset about something no matter what. If it takes him more than 2 minutes to find his keys, he'll tear the house apart angrily, grunting and groaning, and throwing things around until he locates them, and then storms out.

Not only that, but he is constantly downloading content for his job (he works from home) and his computer freezes up a lot and gets viruses. This is probably when he gets the most upset. He makes a HUGE deal about this every time, yet he refuses to get virus protection. If there is ever a technological mishap, it's like the world is fucking crumbling around him.

A specific incident regarding this sticks out. This past week, my brother took the written/physical fitness test portion required to get into the police academy and he passed with flying colors! My Dad and I were the only ones home when he got back and I was congratulating my brother and asking questions because I was obviously super happy for him! My Dad, on the other hand, was yelling at his computer and throwing a tantrum because he couldn't figure out how to find the traffic conditions. My brother offered to check which just made my Dad more upset, but he complied and stormed off like usual. Never congratulated him or anything. I don't know why a father would act this way on a really big day for his only son.

The most recent incident happened last night. His friend on facebook posted a racist joke which understandably rubbed him the wrong way. Now, I understand in some situations it's important to speak up, however this was the fourth or fifth time he had complained to us about the same guy to which each time we all told my Dad to unfriend him because there was no use in arguing with people like that. He then tried explaining to my brother and I (by talking over us, &amp; constantly repeating no no no no no while we were trying to talk) that we were wrong and that we needed to use logic because it's stupid to ignore people like that.

Every time he is upset, he just complains, groans, then walks outside to have a cigarette. It's always a battle with him. Whenever we call him out, he just gets more defensive and upset. He just says I'm 58 I'll do whatever I want, like that's supposed to solve something.

I should probably mention he is a heavy drinker, rarely leaves the house besides to go to the store to get more beer and cigarettes. He also never really eats vegetables or fruits, and recently had a very minor stroke (the doctors aren't really sure what caused it). I'm sure this plays a role in everything, but it is impossible to talk to him about any of it without it starting a string of pointless arguments.

Maybe none of this sounds like a big deal, but my Mom has mentioned that he is starting to scare her, and I leave for school in a few months and won't be anywhere near home.

14621,Non-Romantic,3g0tft,"Hi boyfriend. If you're reading this, sorry. I just need an outside perspective.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 7 years. Our relationship is great!  Conversations are good, the silence isn't awkward, the sex is yesyesyes, and our families love the other.  We're probably going to spend the rest of our lives together.

But there's one thing: his little brother has all types of issues.  I don't even want to go through them but I'm sure they're all anxiety related. Their parents have spent a lot of money trying to figure out what the problem was and then when finally he went to a therapist (or psychiatrist, I couldn't remember) and they wanted to put him on meds, he tried it once and said I don't like how it makes me feel and that was that.

He's pretty spoiled so whatever he says goes when it comes to their parents [50s], hence why the medication never continued. Their parents don't really...parent.  Their dad doesn't care much about anything anymore since now he's unemployed and is just at his computer all day.  Apparently, back then, he used to be really strict on my boyfriend when it came to school and stuff.  Now it's just blah.  And their mom does not want to be authoritative.  She has told me this.  She has told me explicitly that she wants to be her kids' friend and not lecture them or give them a hard time.  (I feel like I should also put here that she still sleeps in the same bed as his little brother.  I mean, he's 16.  Someone tell me the level of normalcy for this.)

So that's where my boyfriend steps in.  He is now the authority figure for his little brother.  And I understand that's how it should be, considering he's 8 years older.  But I feel like he shouldn't be the only one doing it.  He does all of it: discipline, lecture, calm him down during an anxiety episode, deals with his tantrums (seriously, we'd be out and his dad will call him and say You need to come home and you can hear his little brother screaming in the background), all on top of being his older brother and his friend.  My boyfriend doesn't like it either but he feels obliged because 1) no one else is going to do it and his parents are going to suffer due to his brother's behavior and 2) he feels responsible for him because he asked for him when he was younger.

It's been an issue a couple of times before in our relationship but since then, I've learned to just turn the other cheek and not care so much since it isn't my problem and it doesn't have to be, paraphrasing my boyfriend's words.  And I get that, but for how long will he feel responsible for his little brother?  When will he decide, Okay, my job's done here and we'll be able to start our lives?  It doesn't seem like his little brother is going to stop needing him any time soon.

Like I said before, my boyfriend and I are most likely going to be spending the rest of our lives together.  I love him.  He's my best friend and he's my everything.  I am very much expecting to just wait this out, but I'm not sure how long that will be.  I guess I'm just here to ask if this is reasonable and not extremely out of the ordinary to make sure I'm not heading placing myself in a huge mess.

Six years ago I had to have surgery for a work related injury. After the surgery I became addicted to pain killers. I'm ashamed to say I did some very bad things during my addiction.

I  lied to my doctor and stole from my both my family and my wife's to fuel my addiction. I did whatever it took no matter how bad it was to get my high.

Eventually I was caught and after an intervention from my wife and friends and family, in addition to nearly destroying my marriage and losing my job and my kid, I went to rehab.

I have now been sober/clean for three years. My wife and I are doing fantastic, I have a great relationship with my kids, and I've pretty much been forgiven and welcomed back with open arms by everyone.

Except my wife's family. They cut me out of thier lives and refuse to believe I've changed. My wife and children are invited to family events, but I am banned. My wife and son used to go without me, but lately they've been going less and less.

My son is disgusted with his mother's side of the family and is angry with thier treatment of me. My wife vacillates between telling me I need to give them more time to being fed up and considering cutting her family out if they don't start letting me back into thier lives.

I understand I caused a lot of hurt and pain with what I did, but I've been clean for years now and I'm trying to make up for all the wrong I did during my addiction.

There was a decade in my life when we didn't speak, and that period only came to an end when he tried to kill himself (by carbon monoxide poisoning, a scheme which only failed because his garage is ventilated), which was about five years ago.  Since then, we've maintained regular contact, though he's been Baker Acted a dozen times.

I'm nervous about putting myself/my family's issues on a public forum like this, so I am using a throwaway and going to leave out specific details. I'm really looking for some legitimate advice here beyond going NC or getting into therapy. (I establish strong healthy boundaries, my personal life is great, I have been in therapy for the past year.)

THE BACKGROUND:

My younger brother and I are very close. Our parents divorced when we were too young to remember, we were passed back and forth when they felt it was convenient. We clung to each other for stability and a sense of belonging. I am overprotective of my brother because of this, and we both developed some mental/emotional scars as a result of this upbringing. My mother and father have their own set of issues. My mother is manic depressive, with codependency and relational problems. She always wanted to be our friend, in her household I was the responsible adult at a very young age. She has not changed much. My father suffered from depression after the divorce and turned to his work and alcoholism as a way to cope. He was very strict because he was always cleaning up after my mother's carelessness for many years. In his household, we were afraid of him. Eventually (HS for us), he got his drinking problem under control and became a much happier person. He tried very hard to make things right, and honestly I have great respect for my father and we have a healthy, happy relationship. 

After HS, I moved away for university and my brother stayed in town to attend the local community college. He remained living with my mother and hanging out with all our old bummy friends. He ended up dropping out of school (He has issues of self-hatred and has always claimed to be stupid and not cut out for education, although he is a very talented artist and musician) and began selling weed to make money. He came out as gay to the family soon after and introduced his boyfriend to us. We were all very supportive and welcoming although no one felt entirely comfortable with the age difference.

However, the boyfriend was very kind, sweet, and took great care of my brother. He brought out the best in him, encouraged him, and honestly my brother looked the happiest I had seen him in a long time.

CURRENT SITUATION:

Fast forward four years, and everything is completely, I don't even know, just terrible. The boyfriend has turned out to be a manipulative, evil person, who physically/emotionally abuses my brother. Turns out everything was a lie and this person is just the worst person on the entire planet. For a whole year my brother did not speak to me because the boyfriend was convinced that my brother and I were plotting against him. (He said some other horrific things, but I can't bring myself to type them here.) He has broken my brother's foot, and a few fingers, and even caused him to get stitches on his head. He has caused my brother to loose job after job, but still demands that he be the primary provider in their relationship. The boyfriend has been unemployed for two years now.

My brother was working at a very good job making decent money for just a HS grad (my dad is friends with the owner), and they had a small apt together. The boyfriend, in one of his crazy rampages, caused a scene at my brother's job and the police got involved. The boyfriend was arrested for public disturbance, trespassing, and assault against my brother. My brother lost his job and had to testify in court against the boyfriend. He said nothing happened, did not press charges, fines were paid and the craziness continued.

Brother lost the apt, and they were out on the streets. Both my mother, my father, and I all opened up our homes to my brother but not the boyfriend. My brother refused, saying that the only home he had was with his boyfriend, and if he wasn't welcome he would rather they sleep together on the streets than in their respective families homes apart. Not even one day later, my mother 'caves' and allows the two of them to move back into my brother's old room.

My father and I were at a loss of what to do, but at the time felt that it was beyond our control and continued to express our love and support for my brother in order to turn his life around and pursue his own happiness and goals.

My mother would (and still does) text/call/keep me up to date with all of the chaos that goes on within her home. She'll call me sobbing with them screaming in the background. She'll text me to talk shit about the boyfriend, or worse my brother. She'll beg for me to interfere, to help her escape from the situation she created. She'll tell me her latest over the top plot to rid her home of the boyfriend. At this point, I've become desensitized to it all. My therapist as helped me see the importance of boundaries and space and instilled a healthy perspective for my part in all this. Which in all honesty, is at a minimum. I do not engage. I live in a different city, speak to my brother over text, and have not spoken/seen the boyfriend in almost 2 years.

I have come to my brother's call of help me move out right now, I need to get out of here only to watch him get manipulated back into this man's arms. I've sat him down and expressed my pain of watching him self-destruct, of watching him show up with another bruise/a new accident. I've gotten him interviews at where I work. I've tried to get him to move to my city and go to the same school as me. I've offered to host him at my apt for as long as he needs. I've told my mother to call the police and have this man removed from her home but she refuses. (Honestly, I think she just needs to be needed by my brother) But the result of all my efforts has always been the same: things get stirred up, then nothing's changed.

My brother sobs about how scared and unhappy he his. He is battered, beaten, and broken down. He is a shell of what he used to be. His youth has slipped away from him and he's not even 23. 

My father continues to offer his home, and to ensure his protection from this man (the boyfriend) but my brother won't go. He refuses to acknowledge my father and ignores him unless he truly desperately needs something. It hurts my father, but he won't stop trying every time my brother comes around.

And now, I've just found out, that once again they were fighting in public but now this time my brother was arrested. My mother bailed him out and brought them BOTH (why?!) back home. Now my brother has to go to probation once a week or go to jail for four years. I am at my limit.

I am so lost, and so hurt, and so confused at what to do. I'm lost because I've done just about anything and everything in my ability that I just about CAN do. I'm hurt because I just don't know why my brother didn't call ME. I've always come when he's called me, I love him unconditionally, and would never let him sit around waiting in a jail cell. I'm confused because I'm scared that he no longer trusts me. The only way I found out about this is because my mother called me, he STILL has not told me. (I think he is ashamed, but this was an emergency, and he chose/is choosing to hide it from me.) I'm confused because my mother continues to allow the situation to thrive/fester beneath her roof and in the meantime destroy our already dismantled family.

Reddit, strangers, humans, brothers, fathers, mothers, sisters, significant others, WHAT CAN I DO?

How can I help my brother? How can I continue to love my family? I feel like each member is on their own deserted island, and I am the sea. I can touch, and I can see, but there is no other connection and there is no inter-relating. I know that everyone involved wants the same thing: My brother to be happy, the boyfriend to just go away and leave us all be, things to resume their assumed sense of normalcy. Why does it seem like despite our efforts (police, interventions, solutions) nothing is helping/working?

A couple months before I left, I had just turned 18 and got access to a trust fund that a family member had left me when he passed. I took some of the money from the fund to put into a savings account in case I needed it. My mom told me I should put her name on the account too so that if I was in the hospital or something she could pay the hospital.

Fast forward to october. We were living in an apartment that was getting to be pretty expensive and so she bought a house that cut our housing costs in half. Around this time we had to change banks. The old bank didn't have online banking but the new one does. When you sign up for these accounts, you put in your email on the paperwork so they can send you an email about your online banking. I had searched for a way before to set it up without that email, but all I could find were results for the banks' credit card accounts. I told my mom about it and she said she had put my email on that account so it was strange that I never got the email. Well tonight I found out how to set it up with just your social and debit card. All the money in the account was gone except for $500.

I asked her what she did with it and she said she didn't have enough money to close on the house so she borrowed it. My mom has borrowed money from everybody in my family and even my boyfriend and never paid anyone back. (I paid back my boyfriend because that's my responsibility because he's my boyfriend.) She had already borrowed about $4k from me a couple years ago. She lied about the reasons so that my trust fund would give her money. Technically that's illegal because it's a UTMA and none of that is supposed to go to her. She didn't ask me to borrow money. She didn't tell me she was borrowing money. She actively hid the fact that she did.

When I confronted her, she said I didn't understand what she was going through. That I was making everything worse because my boyfriend is coming to visit for christmas and that was stressing her out. That I was blowing everything out of proportion. I asked her for an apology and she said that she was sorry she didn't tell me. As if it was just an oops. forgot to mention you have a dentist appointment tomorrow. When I got upset and started crying and asked her how she could do that to me and how I am supposed to trust her anymore, she said Well how am I supposed to trust you when you can't even drive. What if I was in the hospital? I don't have anybody else (she doesn't have any friends and most of our family is on the other side of the country). I told her that the only way I could have anything other than 0 trust for her was if she said verbatim I'm sorry I hurt you and she said I'm sorry I did that but I took it as good enough.

So to catch everyone up here, she borrowed $4k illegally but with my permission, another $4k from my boyfriend that I paid back to him so now she owes me instead of him, and now she has also stolen between $8 and $18k from me on top of that. (She has kept the bank statements from me for so long that I don't remember how much was in that account) I know legally she can take it without any consequences so it isn't legally stealing but in the real sense of the word it is absolutely stealing. She knows that or she wouldn't have hid it from me.

I know step 1 is to get a bank account in my own name. I just don't know what any of the other steps are. At what step do I feel like I can trust anybody ever again and at what step do I get out of here with my pets when I can't even drive. Do I move out? Can I move out? What then? Even when I have all the independence stuff sorted out, how/when/can I even sort out the emotional side of having no family or friends and being completely alone except for my boyfriend? Of not having anybody in my life that I've ever been able to trust or depend on or even be vulnerable around.

I feel so stupid. I should have known better than to let her be on the account. She has borrowed from everybody in my family. She rushed me into getting the account but would always lose the statements or be too busy to show them to me. She made snide remarks about me spending &lt;$400 on black friday/cyber monday sales and presents for my boyfriend when I had barely touched the money in that account since I got it except for plane tickets and to pay my boyfriend back the money she owed him. I have an Ndad, I should know the signs of manipulation by now. Apparently I'm just too fucking stupid.

I'm sorry if this is jumbled and hard to read. I'm sitting here crying and shaking. I feel like I'm going to throw up. I understand that she needed the money and I'm not trying to be greedy. I just don't understand why she would take it in a way that would hurt me so badly.

14659,Non-Romantic,236cfu,"EDIT: I am going to rephrase this entire post because 99% of comments are based on me doing a program I'm not. My fault for not providing enough identifying details, but you know, anonymity.

I have just started my masters. There are two subjects I have received advanced standing for, because they are undergrad introductory subjects I have already completed. It is not an audit, I have already received the credit, I do not pay for the class and do not do the assignments. Sometimes I attend the lecture component for revision. Sometimes I do not. I phrased this as skipping because this is what the person in question (called M) considers it. I have explained that I don't need to attend the class to her, but it seems she is having the same response as this thread, so I need to make it more clear to her.

The masters is by coursework, not research. I do not intend to do a PhD. I intend to become a practicing clinician.

I fucked up at the start by missing 3 one hour classes in an introductory subject on a topic I am not familiar with. This is because the class is at 8am and I slept in. There is no excuse for this. I am now attending every one of these classes and intend to continue.

I acknowledge that missing the subject I am unfamiliar with is a big problem. I did not make it clear enough that missing the other two subjects is actually the default position, and by going to class at all I am doing more than is necessary of me.

My problem is with M noticing that I am often not in class and mentioning this to me and others. I was unsure why she would do this. I have received some good advice so far to explain why. If anyone else wants to add anything feel free.

14670,Non-Romantic,2l57i6,"I am at an impasse with my parents. I am 30F, and I have lived away from home since I was 18. I have never had a great relationship with my parents, but it's been fairly civil. I moved out to be away from my mother, to live with my then boyfriend, now husband. We married and then moved about two hours away from where both of our sets of parents live. We visited often, about every other month or so. Each set visited us about every four months, his parents more than mine.


Two years ago, we moved 2000 miles away for my husband's job. This has enabled us to have a life we never imagined (in the good way!), but it started out with struggles. We were only able to go home to visit once in the first year, but have managed to visit every six months now.

My parents rarely call, I always call them. I have called them over 30 times in six months, whereas they have only called me 4 times. They have yet to come visit us, but they travel by car (approximately 8 hours there, same back) to visit my sister. Each time I bring up a possible visit, I am stonewalled and they say, It's easier to go visit her because she's closer.


I finally broke down today and broached the topic, as I have so many times unsuccessfully in the past. Today I hit a nerve. I had purposefully not called, because I knew that my mom was visiting my sister. They do not call me when they are at my sister's house, for whatever reason, but I had a suspicion that they were on their drive back home. I was right. They called me on the way home, and I didn't answer, but started the awkward conversation of, Why is it so hard for you to come visit us? and I sent a text detailing how often I call and visit versus how often they call and visit. I was polite, but to the point.


We have more money now, but the first year and a half was vicious for us. We basically borrowed money from friends so we could go home to visit. My parents are retirees, but they still work fairly regularly, and each have a comfortable pension.


When I asked my parents why they refused to visit us, but would go see my sister (sometimes every other month, sometimes more), I received a bevy of answers:

* It's too far to drive there. (The answer given until today)

* There is no room to sleep in (Even though we have an air mattress that we will gladly sleep on, giving them our comfy bed, and the privacy that comes from our bedroom, while we would sleep in the other room, our office. Also, I didn't mention this to them, but why would we have a spare bedroom, vacant for all other uses, for them if they refuse to visit us?)

* My Dad claims he hates driving out here, even though we offered to chauffeur them wherever they needed to go. We live in a suburb anyway, so even if they rented a car, the worst driving would be from the airport to our house, which we could easily do. Our neighborhood is quite residential.



My mom claims that they didn't realize how unbalanced our relationship is, and I believe her. She is quite non-confrontational (and I am, too, to a point), and also, they generally don't tend to think about things outside their bubble. They are close to my sister because she has made herself a clone of my mother.  Same personality, same job, same everything. I beat to my own drum but I am not exclusionary to anyone. My family (each side) has the tendency to bully (my mom's siblings pick on her brother, because he moved, and anyone else who is the slightest bit different. Cousins and aunts are labeled weird for nearly any normal behavior. My dad and his sister were neglected after his father remarried, so my dad was always seen as inferior in his dad's eyes, a terrible man for many reasons.). I refuse to play the bullying game, but I'm quiet about it. I don't chime in when people start bulling (my aunt and my sisters, yes, I have two, but she is older than me also and lives at home, that's another story), I wait for it to be over and then start in on the new conversation. I stood up once, and it got me shunned for a good two years or so.


I think I'm babbling. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. I don't know how much information I need for you all to give advice. Like I said before, I texted, and then we had a conversation on the phone. My mom, quite frustratedly, asked, What do you want me to do? and I responded, To want to know me, to call me, to visit me, and just generally be a part of my life. But that answer wasn't enough for her. She wants this to be all wrapped up in a tidy little package, and I don't know how to do that.

I have flirted with the idea of estrangement, and truthfully, I'm pretty estranged from my family anyway. I don't want to just walk away, because I've never been beaten or molested, or anything like that. Both of my parents were quite absent when I was growing up, but I don't feel like that means that I should cut off ties as an adult. I definitely could have had it worse, and believe me, I'm thankful. I want to have a healthy, fulfilling relationship with both of them.

I told my mom that I would call her in a few days. Now I have a few days to sit and think about what could create a healthy give and take relationship. Any thoughts? I will answer any questions, though honestly, I am not expecting ANY questions.

So, I'm graduating high school in 3 weeks, and for part of the ceremony, the people organizing it all ask you to sign up in groups of 4 for who you walk onto the stage with and sit down with (it literally will take 1 minute). Carrie and I had discussed this and who we'd be walking with earlier, but never made any promises or official decisions as to who we would for sure be walking with. 

On Monday, 3 of my other best friends - one of which being my all time best friends since we were 3 who doesn't get along with Carrie very well -  (all 17/f) came up to me and asked me if I would be in their group of 4 for the commencement, and I said sure. We signed up. No big deal. I just thought that if Carrie signed up with some of her other friends for right after us she could still sit with me and it would all be good, but apparently not.

Carrie saw the sign up sheet before I had a chance to tell her that I was walking with 3 of my other friends and she has been completely ignoring me in person and through text ever since. I tried speaking to her today, but she just looked at me today and purposely walked into my shoulder and kept walking away, ignoring me. I've tried to explain to her why I chose to be with my other friends, but she just won't even acknowledge me.

My friends and I are a very close bunch who never fight, never have drama, or anything, so I'm super confused as to why she's acting this way, because it's never happened before.

So my dad has been with this woman for about 10 years. At first she seemed nice. My dad went to visit her, and they kept it at that for about 5 - 7 months? They ended up agreeing to move in together, she moved in with us. Immediate change, she was an ass to me and my brother, and I quickly found out she had a drinking problem. Well, over the years she developed a drug problem. She'd run out of the house and be gone for weeks. She even tried to offer me Spice(K-2) whatever you want to call it. I ended up telling my dad, she left for a while, she came back. Nothing got better. In fact a week ago she went to jail for drug abuse and stealing from a grocery store, and that was her 2nd time in jail in under a month. I think you get the point.

My dad isn't the smartest person in the world. I talk to him about it and the only thing I got out of it was he doesn't want to be alone.

14683,Non-Romantic,3888ps,"My boyfriend Hank* and I have been together for almost four years. We moved across the country with my dad’s family for a new start about two years ago. We’ve moved out of their house (they let us stay with them until we got on our feet) and we’ve been renting our own house for almost a year.

Because of our busy schedules with work, school, family functions, and general life stuff, we’ve had a lot of trouble making friends. It doesn’t help that we live in an area that’s mostly older families and retirees. I’ve managed to make a few friends around our age, although I’m very shy and it’s hard for me to reach out to them without seeming (in my eyes) weird and clingy. He’s made a few older friends who are 10+ years older than us.

One of his old friends John*  from high school messaged my boyfriend via facebook about being nearby in a couple weeks in our metropolitan area with his girlfriend Jane*. My boyfriend said that if they wanted to stay longer with us, they could. John accepted and he and Jane changed their flights so that they would be coming a few days before their conference and leaving right after.

Of course, Hank didn’t talk to me about this. He told me one day that John and Jane would be coming to stay with us on a Tuesday and leaving on a Friday. I knew about a week in advance.

My boyfriend knows that John used to date one of my high school friends Amy*. She and I weren’t close after high school so I don’t know all the details of their relationship, but from other friends that I’ve kept in touch with, Amy became a drug abuser, a dealer, a stripper, and stole lots of things from her “friends”. From what Hank tells me, John was straight edge. Until, of course, he met Amy. I saw on facebook they’d post about getting high and going around town. I don’t know how much John has changed in the ~1 year since dating Amy and now dating Jane, but I’m not super comfortable with him being in our house.

I forgot to mention that Hank is both going to school and working. He goes to school in the morning and works in the evening. His schedule changed yesterday, and rather than working the 20 hours he was originally going to (with adequate time to hang out with John and Jane) he is now working 40 hours and won’t be seeing them at all unless it’s between school and work, and then driving them to their hotel on Friday.

So, that leaves me with playing hostess with *his friends* after I get done with work. I’m not excited to hang out with them at all. We have two dogs, so I told Hank that I’d be taking them to my dad’s house during the day under the guise of “not wanting John and Jane to have to deal with them during the day” since they can be jerks and bark a lot. I actually want the dogs out of the house because I’m not comfortable with one of the dogs being alone with strangers, since she can get aggressive and territorial with strangers. Hank doesn’t think she’d be a problem.

So, reddit, how do I deal with strangers in my house without being overly paranoid? I’m extremely socially awkward and have been having anxiety about them coming. Do I just deal with it? I’d love to just stay at my dad’s house and ignore them.

Oh, and they’re probably on their way from the airport to my house in a cab right now. They’ll be staying until Friday. With no car. So literally the only thing they will be doing is sitting at our house.

My mother and step father dealt with intimidation from him in the early years, and court battles over child support, and I don't even want to know the extent of the abuse to my mother (he never laid a finger on me, but there was intimidation). They never said a bad word about him until now. 31 years later.

I'm supposed to visit him for two days this week (longest trip in 5 or so years) and I know he's excited about it.

This year he started struggling with some feelings of depression and loneliness, and it pretty much turned him into something of a bipolar asshole. 

I tried helping him through it, recommended him counselors and such, but he refused to try anything. He became pretty socially destructive and alienated himself from another good friend. Generally speaking, he's not very pleasant to be around anymore. I didn't hang out with him for a week and definitely felt a lot more happy and relaxed.

 My Mom has a narcissistic personality disorder and BPD. She is also very controlling and when it suits her she will be generous if it gives her attention. Growing up she would tell us stories of her childhood with her seven brothers and sisters but when me and my siblings came into adolescence her personality changed. She started telling lies to strangers and family members about our myself and my sisters. Maybe when I was a child I didn't notice it but as we grew older the lies became more wild and obvious to myself and my siblings. There were several times I received angry phone calls and emails from cousins over imaginary events that painted my Mom as the poor woman with terrible children. Of course in their minds they couldn't imagine my Mom lying so our family began to think the worst of us despite being good kids with good grades. Of course we weren't saints (what teen is?) but we were far from the abusive spoiled brats that my Mom painted us out to be. Almost all of these occurrences revolved around me and my two sisters never our brother (who is the youngest only son and golden child). When we would confront our Mom she would claim either ignorance or they must have misheard her. 


 My Mom is an RN and she has frequently made claims of being better than the doctors she works with and even going as far as bragging about convincing a woman to circumcise her son with false information. She preached the perils of a boy possessing a foreskin based on her religious reasons that she did it because it was her Duty to God. I got upset and questioned her ethics and she flew into a rage and threatened to call the police and kick me out. (I was 16 at the time)

He frequently flip flopped between taking his medication and stopping to abuse heroin and other drugs. He was found by his nurse on the floor of his apartment severely brain damaged from an overdose of various medications. He was on life support and my Mom made the decision to let him pass on. I was incredibly sad by what happened to my Uncle because we were close. When I was visiting from out of state I would take him shopping and help him as much as I could. I loved his stories and who he is. He was just terribly flawed when it came to loving himself. It was terrible to watch him pass on in such a terrible state. 


Days later my Mom began talking about how his druggie friends intentionally gave him so much of his medication while he was almost black out drunk so that they could give him a merciful death/steal his cash. She claimed there was nothing we could do because she convinced the doctor who wrote the death certificate to make the cause of death natural causes. I asked her, if she did do that, why would she falsify documents like that when those people needed to be arrested. She said that she didn't want them to have the satisfaction of thinking they caused his death. I was like... wtf? They did cause his death if what your saying is true! I told her that she should go to the police with the knowledge that she had but she refused. She said that she wasn't going to ruin the life of the doctor who wrote the death certificate. I felt sick to my stomach hearing this. 


 I don't know what to do. She's a pathological liar and a narcissist. She's just an RN working at a hospital how could she possibly do something like that? How can she be more concerned about appearances and the livelihood of a strange man who apparently wrote a false document as a favor for her than her own brother getting justice?


 I just don't know what's true of false with her. I barely keep contact with her as it is because of her toxic behavior and lies. I don't know if she lied about having the capabilities of doing something like that because she's insecure over my success at work and my husband's successes. She's superficial enough to care about things like that. It's breaking my heart if it's true and it's breaking my heart that she could lie about her twin brother's death. It makes me feel sick. I need to know if she's full of shit. I tried to get more information from her but apparently she's the only source of any of it. No one else knows.

B and C have not changed the way they treat me and I do not have any issues with them at the moment. 

I really don't want to talk to her about the gossip, but I find it hard to ignore the gossip. I plan on avoiding her from now on. Not making eye contact, only speaking to her when I have too, not even the casual 'morning' or 'hello', and only keeping eye contact/noticing our mutual friends and ignoring her.

14749,Non-Romantic,2q4elq,"I live with three other people, and we're all in college (and all early 20s). One of my roommates is usually a nice guy, but every time something even vaguely political or controversial (or just something he has tangential knowledge on), he's got to absolutely dominate the conversation with his personal wisdom on the topic (he's an Engineering major from a small town; he's not that worldly). 

For instance, I had a doctor's appointment for some head pain I've been having (perhaps stress headaches caused by him). I told him about the migraines and why I was seeing a doctor, and that 1) prompted him to launch into a rant about why what I was having were not real migraines (even though the doctor told me I was having actual migraines), and 2) had him talking about *his* migraines and why they're so bad until I just walked into my room and stopped talking to him. I told him well, uh, then apparently the doctor is wrong, and he said Yeah probably!. I stress again, the guy is an environmental engineering major with no medical professionals in his family. 

The other thing he does, which is probably just a subset of the previous paragraph: He can't just let people talk about their own lives. I was eavesdropping on him studying with a group of people in the living room, and every time one of them would start telling a story, he'd butt in and totally redirect the story to be about himself. I was starting to feel really bad for this one girl there, because she was constantly getting shut down by this guy. 

How can I tell him about how he comes off, and what can I do about this behavior, while still staying in an amicable relationship with the guy? He's generally nice (I choose to keep him as a roommate from last year), but recently it seems like its been getting worse, because I've found it just unbearable to talk to with him for more than a few minutes. Another one of my other roommates has discussed him with me (we vent to each other about it), and we agree that the guy's behavior is off.

14753,Non-Romantic,2fnnus,"My family is pretty religious, I wouldn't say we are fundamentalist, but my parents are definitely not fond of homosexuality.  I've always been the more secular oriented one in the family, so that stuff doesn't bother me at all, but it bothers my parents.  Whats weird is that my younger sister is always extremely religious, or at least pretends to be that way.  She is always first to arrive at church, last to leave, etc.  Always praying, always making a big deal out of her religion, making sure everyone knows she prays, is religious.

Well, I caught her.  My parents were out for the week in another city, and I was at home with my sister.  I have classes during the day, and I work afterwards, I usually come back really late, normally around 11pm.

On this day I arrived back early.  I called my sister to see if she was at home or not, no answer. I went to check her bedroom, it was empty. Its strange cause I was certain she was meant to be at home.  She said her friend would be dropping by for a bit, and leaving before I arrived, but she promised they wouldn't go far. 

I go and check our parent's bed room, and would you have, there are two naked girls in the bed there asleep. As I open the door and see, I literally shout WHAT THE FUCK, and they wake up, my sister jumps out of bed, looks at me, and there is another girl in their with her, both butt naked.

I slam the door behind me as I back the fuck out of their.  I leave the house and go drive around for an hour, I need to clear my head, and also give them time to get their shit together.  I see so many texts from her, very angry ones.

I go back home, she's completely freaking out.  I don't want to bring it up, but she is terrified I will tell our parents.  She is crying her heart out.  I keep trying to assure her I won't, but she doesn't believe me.

She has a history of self-harm, and not so subtly threatened further harm if I told anyone.  I assured her I won't tell anyone.

Yes I'm religious, but no it doesn't bother me. Its her life, whether its a choice or whether she's born with it, she's not hurting anyone, so I want her to be happy. But my parents won't see it like that.

She has every reason to be terrified of them finding out, because there is a very real chance they might do something drastic like disowning her.  So I'm scared of them finding out, but I know its inevitable. How long can she hide it.

What I'm really worried about is the repercussions this will have on our family.  Best case scenario is she keeps it hidden until she's finished college, but I don't see that happening.  I see this as having massive potential to rip our family apart.

14755,Non-Romantic,1yla0n,"Hi reddit,

Lets start out with some background information...their is this girl, lets call her Sarah. Her an I had a very short relationship about one year ago. Nothing serious but we broke up because it was kind of pointless to go forward. We didn't talk for a while but we had a few classes together at our new school (High School) so i thought
It's pointless to just be awkward in half of our classes so we might as well just be friends. I'm pretty sure i texted her those exact words, and she agreed so from there we were friends again.


Fast forward about 2 months she tells me her boyfriend fingered her. I kind of freak the fuck out and tell her to get out of that relationship because hes defiantly exploiting her (hes 1 year 
older then her) I say hes exploiting her because she had some major issues in the past with depression and stuff (actually one suicide attempt) she tells me shes so embarrassed and makes me promise
I'll tell no one, I of course say I wont because that would ruin her entire life and make me look bad as well, so I tell no one. Fast forward one more month she tells me after a High School dance 
him and her go to her house and she sucks his dick...and he went down on her. I once again just kinda of go on a mental rampage, I tell her we need to take a break so I can think about this.
So over the next few days I'm thinking about this one of my friends comes up to me and says Did you hear Sarah sucked Tyler's (Not his real name of course) dick, and he went down on her?, I deny it.

But  a few days later she texts me saying It's been killing me not talking to you can we resolve this problem? Now I care about this girl **A LOT** and I agree to be friends again if she breaks up with him. She agrees and we continue our friendship but in a somewhat of on the down-low because I don't want to be known as the guy who hangs out with Sarah who sucked Tyler's dick. We go on being friends and she asks me one day what I thought of people that had sex in their freshman year of High School I say that they're stupid and throwing away something that's meant to be used later in a more serious relationship.

 About one hour later she texts me saying I'm so sorry, never talk to me again I'm a whore.. I learn her and some other guy I knew
very little about had sex (Lets call him Douche). I for some reason dont go full blown What the fuck is wrong with you I say Sarah, do you realize how much I care about you? We precede to get
 into a pretty deep conversation and she confesses she had Douche over to piss of Tyler (which they had broken up a few days prior). She says her and Douche talked about it before hand and decided to do so.

 Now I was in a state of disbelief for quite a while but i somehow felt happy because I have no advice to give her anymore because shes done everything I told her not to.  I also figure out she did it because it makes herself feel better. Now no one except her and I and a few of her friends know this, but shes lost a lot of friends over people figuring out about the oral thing but no one knows about her having sex with some sophomore. So now I'm here and were really good friends and she agreed to never talk to anyone shes been sexual with.


She actually follows through with this and I'm happy with her for doing so. She tells me I'm easily her best friend (I don't think shes lying we've been through a lot)  and I respond  saying the same (I really care about her and she easily is my best friend as well). Now today I have reason to believe her and Douche are going sledding. I honestly don't know what to do I've told her I really don't want him and her hanging out but i have yet to hear a reply (maybe 2 hours ago). I need to know what to do I cant just stop being friends with her because I'm 99% sure she would go off the deep end, and no doubt start getting boned by this guy again. I need to make sure you guys know that I care **WAY** to much about her and would hate myself 
for doing that to her. If you guys have any ideas of what I can do please let me know i'm lost right now. I'm sure I've forgotten a few things but if I remember Ill make sure to update. Thanks.

Edit: I dont know why some of the words are all blue I'll try to figure out why.

On my phone, so apologize for autocorrects. 
 
I've know this guy nearly my entire life. (I'm 27f). In high school he was popular and did well. Six weeks before graduation he dropped out, because he said people were talking about him too much. He didn't get his license, but did everything he was supposed to right until it was time to get his license and then didn't. 

After high school, we all moved on. College, grad school, doctorates and he remained with his parents without a high school diploma. Eventually he got his diploma through a program, but didn't get a college degree. So his parents, who's health is failing, have to drive him everywhere. This included to and from work, to go shopping, and the gym everyday. 

At one point his parents attempted to force him to get his life in order. He responded by attacking his dad with a golf club, and another time with a knife. He is well over 6 feet and works out religiously. When his mom wouldn't do what he wanted, he would spit on her and slap her. Eventually he got in trouble with the police for this, and that's when his family told me all of this. It was about 3 years ago. His mom dropped the restraining order and let him come home so he wouldn't be homeless. 

He told me that everything is his parents fault. His sister (my closest and dearest friend) had cancer as a child. He says his parents loved her more. His family is basically poor. He blames them for not giving him the life he thinks he should have had. 

Since he's move home nothing has changed. His mother or father will be admitted to the hospital, and the other can't stay because they have to drive this guy to the gym, so that he doesn't loose his temper. They are afraid of him. 

I'm afraid that he has some sort of mental illness. He refuses to talk about anything and leeches off his parents who can't even afford their basic bills. He doesn't pay any rent or utilities. 

I'm afraid everything will come to a head this fall. His best friend (M) since childhood is getting married. He is not only not the best man, he's not in the wedding at all. When he feels rejected he drinks and lashes out. M is in his early 30s and says he has to give up on him, and surround himself with productive individuals. I know this will make this guy freak out. He's a heavy drinker.

His parents are afraid of him. His sister has anxiety issues and won't confront him. His parents ask for help, but he ignores them. I don't feel like there's anything I can do, but I'm very close with M (my grad school roommate). I know this guy will do something ridiculous, criminal, and dangerous during or after the wedding. 

Is there anything I can do?

14772,Non-Romantic,21cuan,"Hello Reddit. I have a roommate that has some issues I believe he needs help with... I'm going to provide a little background and then get to the root issue. The impetus for me writing this post is me getting frustrated about the mess he constantly leaves around the house.


I am living with two friends... one I have been happily living with for three years now. One, I'll call K. K is a good childhood friend. I've outlasted a bunch of other roommates who have lived with us. I've been kept around mostly because I try to keep the place clean, don't start drama, etc. K owns the house we live in. Full disclosure, I've been called a neat freak and OCD, which I admit to.


The other person living with us, I'll call J. J was another childhood friend, but moved away when we were younger... before we had access to cars. J and K kept in touch, but honestly I didn't hear from J for about 13 years until I found out he was coming to live with us.


J has fallen on some hard times. He has a less than useful degree in English that he hasn't been able to translate into a job. Because of this he works in a retail environment, that from what I hear from him is a pretty negative environment. He often comes home in a manic state because either his job has been threatened for petty reasons, or he's been forced to do something not in his job title... like clean an overflowed toilet. He is **not** a janitor and that's not part of his job.


Last year Js mother passed away very quickly and unexpectedly due to cancer. Js mother was not prepared for this, and left a giant financial mess for J to take care of in her absence. Death-bed will, all the things you're not supposed to do basically. J was completely unprepared to deal with these issues, and it's been a huge point of stress and pain for him recently to overcome these issues.

After his mother's death, J packed all his shit up, and moved a long distance from his mother's home to our house. He left friends and family in his old state, and was able to get a new job at his previous employer in the new state. It was honestly one of the bravest things I think J has ever done, and I give him a lot of credit for having the balls to go through with this, despite the shortcomings I will describe below. 


J is not the most social person... he's a big anime fan, only listens to j-pop music (cannot speak or read japanese), leads our small home group in D&amp;D sessions, and prefers to spend 90% of his free time holed up in his room. His personal hygiene and organizational skills are very below par. He is capable of dressing himself, washing himself and cleaning his teeth... but will apply a very half-assed incomplete effort to shaving, leaving him with missed patches of hair and looking less than professional or adult. His room is a disaster and often has the smell of his poorly kept fish tank emanating from it. If you look in his room, there are often dirty dishes piled upon each other, cat litter on the floor, and other detritus that hasn't been taken care of in weeks.

**Root Issue: Inability to finish anything, The 5+ Year Catfish**

There are many other things I believe are huge problems with J, but the biggest is his 5 year catfish relationship he is currently engaged in. Previous to his mother's death, he has been communicating with someone online he refers to as his entity. He has never heard this person's voice, seen a picture of them, or had any in-person interaction with them. He does not know if they are officially in a relationship, and is absolutely terrified of doing anything that might constitute taking a next step... for fear that this person will be revolted with what they see and never talk to him again.

J, K and I have talked about this situation extensively in both group settings and individually amongst ourselves. He acknowledges the fact that the other person he is talking to may not be who they say they are. For him, even discovering this fact would be terrible, so he prefers to perpetuate the the lie of her true identity; the mediocrity that he is comfortable with. He openly acknowledges that he is lying to himself, but seems to have a cognitive dissonance that prevents him from actually doing anything about it.

Instead of telling J that he needs to cease his relationship because it's destructive to himself, we've basically told him that if this is what he really wants he should pursue it then. Any attempts to help him move forward with his life are met with extreme resistance. Trying to get him to come out with us and be social has been like pulling teeth... until he bought himself a smartphone. Why did he do this? So he could continue talking to his entity while we were out. I have started calling him out lately on his habit of zoning out mid-conversation while talking to the entity. He does not see how rude it is to ignore someone talking to you while you tap away on your phone. He does not seem capable of relaxing or otherwise taking a load off his mind without obsessively communicating with his entity.

I am kind of at a loss of how I can help J move forward. If J was a teenager, this would be understandable behavior... but J, K and I are all late 20s males... and J is actually the oldest of the 3.

While some might say it's not my right  to interfere in his life like this, I believe what he's perpetuating is basically lying to himself and setting himself up for heartbreak and failure. Many things in his life exhibit a failure to complete things... and this is just another symptom of that sickness. One that he's allowed to go on for **FIVE YEARS**... he's been comfortable lying to himself for 5 years that things are ok. At first I just wanted to ignore his problems, but it genuinely bothers me to see a friend carry on in ways that will never benefit him and actively hold him back from being a more adult human being.

In a previous post that got taken down in /r/askreddit, someone said why bother this poor guy if he's happy with his relationship. The entity has several times disappeared for a week at time, without any notice. J will become EXTREMELY anxious and cranky when this happens, and eventually get a little worked up and say how he doesn't appreciate the behavior. She will return with a half-assed excuse about power going out for a week, which he won't even question... and then back to business as usual. He has set two soft deadlines for himself that have gone and passed... talking to her on the phone for his birthday and exchanging pictures with her for valentine's day. Both were completely avoided, and swept under the rug as if they never existed before.

I believe he maintains the relationship because he says it's all he has... yet he fails to recognize that he has nothing. He never discusses any personal issues with his entity... just anime and video games. He doesn't want to bother her with any of the mundane issues he has in life. She seems to be purely an escape from the shitty life that he's made for himself, or failed to make for himself.

I need to do something because J's lack of follow up exhibited in how he handles personal relationships results in him leaving his shit all over the house. J will never take out the recycling, a large portion of which he generates. I have never seen J take out the trash once. J will leave his laptop bag, keys, and wallet strewn about the downstairs group area. We let him borrow a desk when he moved in, and after two months of using the desk, it was covered in the scum of uncleaned food and other items. It took me a 1/2 hour and a scrub brush to return the table to its previous clean state. He had NO PROBLEM living with this disgusting table, and spending hours using his computer there on a daily basis.

**tl;dr I am looking for perspective, suggestions, or anything else anybody might be able to add that might help me do the following**

* better co-exist with J
* help J overcome the things preventing him from moving forward in life
* help me not to not be an overbearing asshole roommate to J
* help me get J to stop living like a hoarder, which causes filth and disorganization to radiate from his personal space

14794,Non-Romantic,32pplj,"I feel silly making a post about this on the internet, but I am sort of at a loss about whether I am being too sensitive or I just need to let this go or what. 

My Dad has not been involved in my life as more than someone who sends money and shows up once a year or so since I was six. It's mostly been my mother, my step-father and me. Consequently, my aunts and my grandparents have also been minimally involved in my life. My grandparents, I give a little bit more of a pass on this one, because they at least called me and would try and pick me up and see me from time to time. Before anyone asks, I am very confident my mother at no point 'kept' my family from me. This has been entirely something that this side of my family did on their own.

Once I was in my 20's, Dad's family starting trying to have more contact with me. My aunts specifically have been reaching out. They send me birthday cards, sometimes texts and emails and I get invited to events my father is attending also.  My father is mildly mentally disabled, and I think they generally expect me to sort of 'look after him' at these events.

This may seem innocuous, but it drives me crazy. Seriously. I hate it, and I have no idea how to escape it. I end up going to weddings, funerals, I get birthday cards from these people who are essentially strangers, pretending to know me, and I'm supposed to be comfortable and ok with this. NO ONE will acknowledge that there is a 20 year period where pretty much no one spoke to me and I didn't see anyone. I'll make jokes about it and everyone will change the subject. I strongly suspect they keep me around because they don't want to have to deal with my father as he ages, and so they don't have to be responsible for him. All I know is for awhile I used to try and reciprocate contact through emails, Facebook, letters, what have you, and I got nothing. No one would add me back, write back, what have you. The contact seems to have to be on their terms. 

Am I being crazy? Too sensitive? Can I just tell these people to leave me alone? Return their birthday cards? What do I do with this? It's awful. It makes me feel very anxious and it's so wildly inconsistent that once I get my feet under me, they swoop back in and knock me sideways again. I have a hard time drawing boundaries with them too because they feel like strangers. It makes me feel crazy. I want them to go away and not come back. Is that unreasonable? How do I do that? Do I have to tell them?

My original goal was to get all of my documents. I had a passport that he kept in his top drawer (yeah, he was a control freak). In the office, my birth certificate. In my room, I left my W-2 form from work. These are things that I HAVE TO HAVE. I realized about 5 minutes after leaving with everything. I tried to go back and retrieve documents. He basically said fuck off and slammed the door in my face. The cop said that the only thing I can do is take him to civil court. But this would cost me money that I don't have.

My mother has a copy of my birth certificate, and my job can request a new W-2 Form (this might take a couple of weeks, so I'm unable to file my taxes this year). As for my passport book AND card are both going to have to be replaced. This will cost me money that I don't have.

As for the relationship between me and my dad, I don't think he will talk to me for a long time. And honestly, I'm in no hurry to be asking him for a damn thing. He is keeping these documents away from me, and I will not give in and go crawling back just to have him laugh in my face. He wants to see me fail at being independent. So I refuse to do that. Reasoning is also impossible.

I could take him to civil court but honestly, I don't see that ending well for me. Costs would be ridiculous and he might just deny having these documents. In fact, he could have already gotten rid of them.

14840,Non-Romantic,2mi6ze,"I met this dude at the end of high school, and we sort of just had everything in common and everything lined up and we became best friends.

I was dating a girl at the time, and did for another 2 years after we met. We went on double dates with him and his girlfriend, etc.

I always struggled with my sexuality, and ended my relationship with my girlfriend and told my closest friends it was because I was gay, I still haven't even told some acquaintances and my family the reason.

He helped me a TON and without him I probably would be in a lot worse place right now with it all.

He still helps me a ton with myself.

Anyway, the one thing that sort of bugs me is he tends to be more open about my sexuality than I do.

He's told his dad, which I guess is fine, but I don't see the reason for it, it made me feel out of place because I go to his house a lot and talk and see his family. His dad is pretty conservative, but doesn't have a problem with it at all.

He has a gay friend at work that we sometimes hang out with when I go out with him and his work friends, and one time this guy said something to me that implied that he knew I was gay. And it just threw me off, because now it is said in front of other people that he works with, and I just don't know in what context it was said to him or who else was around at his work when he told this guy.

And he has this other female friend that he knows at college that said something to me too when I hung out with them that implied she knew.

The latest thing is he has a new girlfriend, and I've met and hung out with them, and she's a cool girl. But he wants to tell her I'm gay.

I just don't see how its anything that concerns her, or them as a couple in any way that it needs to be said out of the blue.

I have no problem with her knowing when it comes up in the natural course of conversation when I'm around, but it just feels weird to have it said when its not relevant at this point.

I don't have a problem with these people knowing, they are people I would tell IF NEEDED, I just feel weird that it didn't come from me, and that I wasn't around to clarify or provide context for something that is very personal to me. It feels like I get talked about behind my back, not in a bad way, but in a way that I'm not there to defend myself or represent myself.

This is in no way hurting or effecting my relationship with my friend, I just honestly don't know what to make of it myself and what my feelings are about this, and why he would have his reasons.

I have asked him, and he said its because he feels like things would be easier for me if people him and I might be around know who I really am so I don't have to hide and spend effort and time carefully constructing my life to keep my sexuality closely hidden. And it also lets you know who is and isn't someone I should hang around. It just still feels sort of strange still.

The other day I was hanging out with him and a couple of our other closest friends (all guys), I have told them all, but I never bring it up at all.

My friend made a comment at a restaurant about me finding another guy attractive. It just made me instantly cringe and tense up because its not something I would ever talk about.

When I asked him after he said that we always talk about the girls we find attractive, and no one cares you find a guy attractive, I just want you to feel like you can fit in with us without your sexuality being so hidden.

Maybe I just need to loosen up?

14851,Non-Romantic,3a6ao5,"I have known Calvin for a 9 years now and he recently moved to the city I lived in early last year with his previous girlfriend, Anna, who he was with for over 3 years. Calvin introduced me to his Anna and some other friends and we soon became a little group going out to dinner and little trips out of the city or just hanging out in general. We all got on quite well.

The beginning of last month, Anna went missing and Calvin called me to help him. I went straight to him and we tried our best to locate her, but unfortunately it was too late and she had committed suicide by jumping off a cliff. Her body was found at the bottom that evening.

We went through a lot during the preceding 2 weeks after her death, from that day onwards it was an emotional rollercoaster. From contacting her parents (she is from abroad) to trying to get access to her body, planning her funeral, locating her belongings that was with her at the time...everything. It really took it's toll on everyone. Seeing her family was the worst because you could see that everyone had been crying non stop yet you had to stay strong for everyone. 

Finally, everything was sorted out towards the middle of May. Her parents left shortly after with her ashes and the only thing left is the final inquest into her death. That will be held hopefully in the upcoming months. 

The hardest part for me as a friend is over and I cannot imagine what Calvin is going through. Helping her family and him remove her belongings was painful as their home is now empty...she had a lot of things..make up..clothes..everything was her and to see it all gone is only a constant reminder of her absence. I tried to be there for him as much as possible..but obviously I didn't want to bother him too much or push him to talk etc. I let things go steadily, talking every now and then with any updates on the situation (death cert. place is wrong..coroner trying to contact etc.). 

He has been going out of the city into another place a few times since and he has told me it is to take his mind off of the situation...which I find good for him as he said he wants to be around people who don't know what happened or just weren't there at the time, so this was understandable.

Last week, we were messaging and I just asked him if there were any updates. He told me there were lots...So I asked him whether this was good or bad..He told me he planned to go to her home country to visit her parents as it is the 90 day mark of her passing as well as her birthday in August. Also that he has a new girlfriend and that he was worried to tell me. I told him that it was fine. It's no biggie, he deserves smile again and if someone new can do that temporarily or permanently, then who am I to judge. I don't really know the 'right' or 'wrong' time length but it's really none of my business. 

And then...he told me that he was moving her into his home. The weekends that he's been spending out of the city has been with this girl and she's now moving to our city to be with him. I'm still fine at this point. Grief does strange things to people.

And then..he told me that I knew her..I know nobody from the place that he told me about but it turns out that actually I don't know KNOW her..it's just that he told me about her 2 years ago. This girl, Brenda, had pursued him (while he was with Anna and she KNEW this) pretty strongly. 

I felt so uncomfortable with this. I literally couldn't sleep...I don't know why. I felt really odd. But..I decided to give it a chance, we had dinner last night with another friend and Calvin and Brenda. They even went to the BATHROOM together. Watching made me feel so uncomfortable, her constant leaning on him, sticking to him...it was weird. 

There's so many other issues...the fact that where she is from, her culture is very money orientated, they've been together less than a month, and he's basically going to pay the entire rent, food, ..everything. Coupled with the fact that he already bought her expensive jewellery, she booked a trip the past weekend for them (cheap flights) and he paid for everything else...car rental...food..hotel. 

It's all just too soon isn't it?

Given the fact that..his last girlfriend is very laid back, low maintenance no designer labels and this girl is ....super high maintenance..expects the guy to pay for everything...it's just..odd.

I don't want to impose something on him or stick my nose where he belongs...but my gut reaction is just to never speak to my friend again...I'm not sure how to process this? This girl feels like bad news. I know as a female, I would not feel comfortable sleeping in another person's bed knowing that it has been less than even 2 months since their passing...It just to me feels like....this girl will stop at nothing to be able to get what she wants?

I don't really know if confrontation is the best thing..yet do I tell him how I feel and abandon him as a friend? What if he needs me at a later time?

To be honest...I also know that this is none of my business..but at the same time..I'm not sure if I AM overstepping my boundaries if I say something? I would consider myself close with him...given that I was with him every step of the way...have met both his and Anna's parents and was the only other person attending the funeral service aside from her family and him.

So a lot has happened since my last update and I have posted some of it in a different sub. I talked to my landlord and my roommate was served a 10 day notice to quit. About a week after i came home to most of my things missing and my room (which I kept locked) was broken into, only my property not my roommates was taken. She lied about her stuff being taken and what time she left (I had a Webcam set up in the living room) luckily I have renters insurance so I'm covered. The detective informed me that he found my Xbox at the pawn shop, turns out the person who pawn it was my roommate boyfriend's brother whom was accompanied by Tre. I applied for a victims protective order which was delays for whatever reason but I moved out so I should be ok. And I received a phone call for my stolen iPad since I had the activation lock on it, but whomever called it in has to be involved since they had my name. I just recently won in small claims court for her breaking the lease by having the roommate move in and as soon as I get the payments I will (hopefully) not ever see my old roommate again. The detective is going to try to press charges against all 3 (maybe 4 if whomever called me about the iPad is involved.)  I just wanted to give everyone an update on how things went and it has been a kinda wild ride lately with a lot of different things happening. Thanks everyone who gave me the advice.

14864,Non-Romantic,1tj28s,"Hi /r/relationships. I'm a first time poster, long time reader. I'm having a very serious problem lately that I do not know how to deal with.

I'll give you folks a little bit of backstory. Several years ago, my father died from cancer. As my father was dying, my mother turned to alcohol as a coping mechanism. After he died, she continued to drink excessively. There are many times that I can remember having to drive her home from public places because she was too drunk. She eventually started sneaking entire boxes of wine into her room and drinking them over the course of a day. In time, my mother eventually saw a substance abuse counselor and stopped drinking. She has also been on antidepressants ever since my father died, but has not taken the time to speak to a counselor about the things going on in her life.

I very recently graduated college. I still live at home, and I pay rent to stay here. As the days to graduation grew closer, my mother would tell me how proud she was of me. At the same time, she started experiencing several stressors at work, stopped taking her antidepressants, and started going out with her best friend to restaurants to have a few drinks. The drinking has slowly been increasing over the past six months ever since she went on a cruise with my sister and the rest of her family. They are all fully aware of her previous addiction problems, but they allowed her to buy fruity drinks on the cruise. Since then, she has been drinking more and more, after having done so well for years and not touching a drop of alcohol.

The day before I graduated, I was very tired and very stressed out. It was my father's birthday, which is always a very tough day for me, and I worked 3rd shift along with going to school full time and driving an hour away from home twice a week for a mandatory internship. I had gotten home from school that day and went to bed. My mother decided to have a surprise celebration on that day and had a couple of family members over for dinner. I told her that I was having a very rough day, I was exhausted, and I just wanted to sleep. I told her I was sorry, but I did not want to take part in the surprise party. She must have come in and out of my room at least three times over the course of the night, demanding that I come downstairs and spend time with them. Each time I told her no until she finally stopped doing it.

I graduated the next day and called her and asked her if I could come see her at work. She was very short with me, and made me feel like graduating was not a big deal. I decided not to go and see her at work. When I got home, I received a phone call for a potential job opportunity and got set up for an interview. I was so excited! I call my mom as soon as I got off the phone with the recruiter and told her that I had an interview set up. Again, I felt like I was getting the cold shoulder from her, so I hung up to avoid confrontation. I received a text from her shortly afterwards saying that I made the entire family feel like garbage, and I should be ashamed of myself.

I took it upon myself to get in touch with my family to see if they were really offended that I had not seen them the day before, and none of them were. I sent a text message back telling her this, but received no reply. Since then, I've got the cold shoulder from both her and my sister. They are very close and think alike. My sister lives in the house with us. I did not make any attempt to try and talk to either of them because I thought this was all very unreasonable and it would blow over. I was wrong.

On Saturday, my girlfriend's parents invited me over to their house for a family dinner and to celebrate my graduation. When my mother find out that this was happening, she went on a tirade and called my girlfriend garbage and said that her parents were useless. She said if I wanted to be part of the family so badly, I didn't have to be part of her family anymore and I could depend on my girlfriend's parents instead. I was angry, and I retaliated and brought up her drinking and her refusal to take her antidepressant, which she had been off for several days at this point. I left the house, I went to my girlfriends parents house, and I had a great time.

Yesterday, my girlfriend came over to my house because we had plans to spend the day together. I was still getting the cold shoulder from my mother and my sister, so I had been avoiding them and locking myself in my room. They have not made any attempts in the past few days to try and come in and speak to me. Before I left to go out with my girlfriend, I tried to go and speak to my mother to see if I could smooth things over before the holidays. I wanted to apologize to her again for not taking part in her surprise party. She was completely wasted, and told me that my girlfriend and her parents were assholes, she no longer considered me her son, and told me I was a disgrace to her. I kept my mouth shut the whole time, hoping that she would rant and I would have a chance to speak to her. Instead, she shoved herself past me, left the room, and went to get more alcohol. She told me that she was going to get wasted, and she didn't care what anyone thought. My girlfriend and my sister heard the whole exchange. My girlfriend was very upset by what my mother had said, and my sister tried to get my mother to stop drinking, but she had become violent. I left the house with my girlfriend before things could escalate any further. By the time I had gotten home, my mother was in bed, &amp; I did not speak to her.

I worked 3rd shift last night, so I went into work at 11 p.m. I got home at 7 a.m. and went up into my room only to have my mother barge in and demand that I take the lock off of my door. I told her I would not be doing that. She told me if I wouldn't, she would take the door down herself. I told her that was fine, and she could try if she wanted to. She called me an asshole and left the room. I locked the door because I've been getting very tired of the constant verbal abuse, the threats, and the cold shoulder due to her alcoholism and her being off of her medication.

I don't know how much longer I'm going to be stuck in this house. I have a job interview on Monday related to my career, but as of right now I do not have enough money to rent a place of my own. I am scared of the way she's acting lately and I fear things are just going to get worse before they get better. I know that she is under a lot of stress, but I also feel as though everything has been blown out of proportion and is escalating very quickly. I don't know what to do, so I am writing this as truthfully as I can to see if anyone can offer me any advice for the time being. I will be seeing my own personal counselor later on in the afternoon, and I will be telling her about everything that's happened over the past few days. Any advice you folks can give me would be greatly appreciated. I want to fix the situation and the abuse to stop, but I fear as long as she continues to drink, stay off of her medication, and refuse to go to counseling, it will not. I'm sorry for the length of the post and I'm sorry if everything is not completely clear. If there's anything else that you would like me to add, please let me know. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I really hope that you can help me out.

14873,Non-Romantic,25hdgr,"So, here goes nothing: 

My Dad has been single and disabled for 20 or so years (minor heart problems). He raised me by himself since my parents got divorced when I was around 12~ish and I have absolute no contact with my mother. 

For the past 8 or so years, he does nothing with his life. He sleeps on the couch, plays video games, watches TV, smokes 2 packs a day and eats frozen food like a kid. He won't leave the house, or do anything else at all. The complaint is his heart and his knees. When it's too cold, it's his knees. When it's too hot, it's his knees or his heart. The truth is, it's none of those things. His Doctor says he's completely fine and should really exercise. He can walk/up down the stairs to the bathroom just fine, but yet he can't walk to his car to even pick me up from the shop when I put my car in last week. However, he'll drive to the gas station for cigarettes or drive-thru food with no problem. I've spoken to his Doctor who gives him health pamphlets for any visit and who urges him to exercise, but he'll complain to me the Doctors won't do anything for him. He's getting very, very dumb. He asks me to pay all of his bills for him, he asks me to speak to people on the phone for him. Anything requiring a slight bit of critical thinking, he'll ask me to do for him. (More on this later). He's not depressed or sad. He is indifferent and sees nothing wrong with his lifestyle. 

Then there's his outlook. I've basically raised myself since I was 15-16. Everything since then in my life, I've bought or learned myself, nothing has been handed to me. Since moving home from college graduation he hasn't said good job on me graduating, he doesn't ask how my job is, he doesn't ask how I am. It's always 'where are you going' when I walk out the door, or it's to complain about anything in general. He just doesn't care. I've never cared about money, but when asked by my family how he could afford two packs of cigarettes a day but can't give me a cent for my birthday (or even remember when it is), he pretends to not hear it, but I digress.

I've been trying very hard to get him to care or do something, especially since it's warming up. I try to take him out for dinner, talk to him about my life or his (nothing is new, so I bring up old topics), etc. He has nothing to add, and just beings complaining about anything minute. Most of the things he asks me to do for him, I simply say no and I talk to him about doing it himself and assist where possible. He has very little to do, and if I take away that, then he'll just get even worse. The problem isn't that he can't do it, it's that he is ultimately lazy. He'll tell me he can't call Comcast to ask about a billing question and ask for me to do it, but he just doesn't want to do it himself. In the end, he'll do it and get upset with me that I'm not helping. If I'm not around to do this, he'll ask his friend who's over all the time to do it for him. 

This really is just the tip of the iceberg and hopefully I've painted an accurate picture of my frustrations and feeling of helplessness toward my Father. I'm moving out in one month and I know that this behavior won't end and it breaks my heart. I've all about given up and am about to leave him to his own devices and destructive habits.

14879,Non-Romantic,2ckdhx,"I have an about to be two year old son. I've had a restraining order against his father, because of physical abuse, since my son was three months old. The order only protects me but I do not allow my son to be alone with my ex. My ex can see him anytime he wants so long as there is a third party present which would be my mom or sister, or his mother. He only tries to see our son about once every three months for only a few hours and its usually to take a few photos for facebook and that's about it. I'm told he spends a lot of time playing on his phone and not really engaging with our son. My sister refers to him as a Facebook dad because its as if he just wants to keep up the appearance he is a good father. He never provides diapers or milk, I once asked for money through my sister for milk and was expected to pay it back, I never did. I am only just now starting the process for child support. 
 So my ex's mother who has made more of an effort to see my son than his father, texted me kind of last minute to come take son for a few hours this last weekend. She does this once a month and she drives from her home town about an a hour away. They usually do lunch go shopping and to the park. So even though I found it odd she texted me last minute, and that my ex texted my sister to reply to his mom when I didn't respond right away I agreed. I figured they were probably meeting together for lunch like hey have done a few times in the past.

 
 Fast forward to today and my sister is friends with my ex on facebook ,so she showed me pictures of my son with my ex and his pregnant gf at their pregnancy announcenment party. I am not upset that she took him to the party but that she was not upfront about what they would be doing. I understand that now that this woman is pregnant and she is now a semi permanent fixture in my ex's life, but my ex is barely even a fixture in my sons life. He does not do anything to provide for him. I feel like my son is too young to understand any of this and his presence at this party was completely superficial. As if my ex is saying  look new gfs family, i'm a good dad because she let me have him today. Plus I never met this woman and I have no idea about what kind of people her family are or what kind of person she is. My ex's mother was the only one from my ex's side at the party so it was all her family.


All that aside I just wish my ex's mother would have been honest and told where they were going, so it wasn't a surprise later. I feel that I have the right to know who and where my son is. Am I wrong to feel this way? Would I be right to even say anything? I am a very non confrontational person but this urks me.

14904,Non-Romantic,2633yi,"Her older sister has schizophrenia and it's really heartbreaking for them.  I've only known them for a short period of time (met them six months ago), although my parents and siblings have known them for years (they met them before I did).  We live in Canada and they live in Australia.  When she asked me if I was happy in Canada, I lied and said yes and I felt really bad lying, so when I came back home to Canada, I asked her if I could email her (her preferred method of communication) and finally tell her about that 'thing.'

So, I shared my truth with her (that a few years ago I worked with a trauma specialist) and told her that I was in a really good place now, but I still wasn't as happy as I wanted to be and that I was working on it.  But, I felt vulnerable and scared and still feel that way, because I shared something so scary about myself with her and she hasn't replied back and it's been more than two months now (which I understand since she's very busy with work and personal things including an on-and-off again relationship with her boyfriend of 8 years).  But, it's scary for me.

So, how do I get over this uncomfortable feeling of vulnerability?  Was it a good idea to share a bit of my past (saying that I had PTSD)?  I thought it was a good idea at first because I was being honest rather than lying and creating visibility because mental health isn't something that people really talk about and I didn't think it was 'fair' to keep something like this from my older cousin when I knew that her sister had schizophrenia.  But, now I just feel like I opened up a can of worms and I don't know what to do.  I should also mention that I didn't initially mention the part about PTSD, but I just said that growing up I was trying to make it through a lot in my life and that things got bad for me during undergrad, but that I was in a good place now.  And then she probed for more information--asked if it was depression and I didn't want to give another partial truth in this situation.  She told me that she wanted to fill me in about her sister (after the first email that I sent her) and other things too.  So, why do I feel like I opened up a can of worms?

How do you know if the problem is your friends, or your own?  If i have three friends that all seem to have issues with me, then I would be smart to take a hard look at myself, right?

A few examples:  the woman in the group talks about her latest relationship, says she wants a guy to pay attention to her, the 'player' type in the group says it works better if you do not pay attention to the woman and I chime in that I 'read an article about how...' and then kind of relay what it said, and how it pertains to the subject we are talking about.  The subject then becomes that I read too many articles, and if I want to figure out relationships, people are too complex to understand by reading.  I need to see a therapist, etc.  Side note: I am getting separated from my wife so it wasn't easy to hear that my idea on how to become smarter in relationships was all wrong.  

Next example, again the woman is talking about the guy who ignores her.  I had read about emotional unavailability and mention it, and say it makes you wonder, maybe its a defense mechanism?  Like how doctors tell you not to eat your favorite foods while getting Chemo for cancer.  You will get sick, then hate the foods you enjoy and tried to eat while on chemo.  the body thinks the food is poison.  Maybe a bad relaitonship does this to us?  I get a lecture on how bad the Chemo analogy is because its not like a relationship at all, its designed to destroy the body!  I even get I thought you were a smart guy, but that analogy does not fit at all.  I try to point out that Chemo was just the example that came to mind, the idea is that our bodies and brains seem to push us away from things that harm us, maybe it relates to relationships... doesn't help.  I feel like she is just finding any way to attack what i say.  

The other two do it sometimes too.  I try really hard to get along, I have read about how to communicate better, validation, things like that, but no matter how much I try, it seems like every few days just me trying to contribute to the group chat gets one or more of them making me feel like shit.  

But, as i said, if multiple people seem to be defensive with you, isn't that a sign that it could be YOU that is the problem?  How do you know?  My problem is that I can't completely let this stuff go, and I think that just perpetuates it.  If I try to talk to one of them singly, I get a lot of 'you worry too much, just be yourself, dont worry what everyone else things, its not confident.  etc etc.  But then I get irritated over time and for example with the relationship conversation after 5 minutes of being told I am doing it all wrong, I am told to see a counselor.  Which i am.  So i say so youre saying I shouldnt read articles online written by counselors or psychologists or about a study that was done, but go talk to someone who ... basically went to college and read articles and books and studies?  Which i realize comes across as being pretty shitty, but how do you handle people pointing the finger at you and not defend yourself?  Is the answer to just bite your tongue and walk away?  I have a hard time with that.

14911,Non-Romantic,3eozng,"I have OCD and depression. I was clinically diagnosed in March of 2014 and have been doing pretty well for myself since starting medication and therapy. Before my diagnosis, I had to drop out of college and was confined to my bedroom, afraid of leaving my room for fear that something bad would happen to me. Now, I have a full time job making pretty decent money, I have my own place, and am finally getting around to enjoying the life I should've been living for the past 4 years.

My mental illness came on during college, which is pretty typical based on everything my doctors and my own research has told me. I have never been abused, never been mistreated or hurt. As an only child (and only grandchild), I did have some issues with being helicopter parented and having basically two sets of parents to answer to (mom and dad, grandma and grandpa). And while that did have an impact on my sanity, I still was not abused. 

Flash forward to this past week, where I have been on vacation with my mom, stepdad, stepsister and brother-in-law, and stepbrother. We had a pretty awesome week all-in-all. On our last night of vacation, however, I had a slight meltdown at a restaurant we nearly ate at.

Here's the set up: we rented a cabin that had uncomfortable beds and bad air conditioning. It's the hottest part of the year and I've been hot all week long. Because no one could agree when to get dinner on that particular night, we skipped lunch and weren't eating dinner until nearly 8 o'clock that evening. Because the restaurant everyone wanted to go to was part of a huge commercial-plex, it was a very long, long walk to the restaurant after walking through the mountains all day. In short, I'm hot, tired, and hungry.

The place where my stepbrother wanted to eat is called Dick's Last Resort. It's got quite a reputation if you don't know about it (I had no clue before walking in). The goal of the wait staff is to insult you throughout dinner. We were seated at a long table with another group of people (strike one for me, I don't care for strangers). The waiter comes over and bangs a handful of those hats against my head. Again, I have no clue what this place is about, so I'm like wtf'ing. Strike two for me. We ordered drinks and I asked for a unsweetened iced tea and then requested sweetener. Dude glares at me and asks what's the point of ordering unsweet if I want sweetener. By this point, I'm ready to go. I'm very uncomfortable and my mom noticed and asked if I was alright. I didn't want to be the kid with the problem since this is our first family vacation all together, so I said, no, I'm fine, even though I'm really, really not comfortable.

But then, dude comes back and starts tying a bib around my neck. I don't like to be touched... I'm working on it, but it's still a thing. I especially don't like to be touched by strangers. I tried to pull it off while he was tying it and kept saying no, please stop. Stop. Please stop, but he kept on, saying I promise not to tie it tight. I let him finish tying it and then ripped it off and had to excuse myself from the table. After that, my family went on ahead and paid for the drinks we'd ordered and then we moved to another restaurant. To their credit, no one made me feel bad for getting up and leaving and my stepsister said she was glad we left anyway, that she didn't care for the gimmick. We had a nice dinner at another place and I was able to calm down after about fifteen minutes and then everything was fine.

That night, after we'd gotten back, my mom came up to my room and checked on me. She sat on my bed and asked if we could talk. I said okay. She told me that could tell I've made a huge improvement in my life in the last year and knows I'll keep going, but said she knows something awful happened to me in college and I can't say anything because I'm afraid.

I assured her that nothing happened to me in college.

She said, I just know you're not the same person you were when you left my house. Something happened to you. You just don't develop all this fear out of nowhere. You were terrified at dinner tonight, and I think I know what it is that happened to you.

Again, I assured her that nothing happened to me and explained that the combination of being hot, tired, hungry, and someone touching me when I didn't want to be touched caused me to have a momentary problem, but I patched myself up quickly and was fine.

She said, I just look at all of the things you've said to me... you say things all the time like 'no means no', you talk about all these statistics about rape and abortions... I think you were date raped by [friend from college] and you just won't talk about it.

I told her again how very, very far off base she was, how that didn't happen. I am a very progressive liberal and have talked to her and my whole family in the past about the way they use slurs and say things. For her to pick that stuff out is cherry-picking to suit her agenda and I told her that. She shrugged her shoulders and just said I know what happened to you and I wish you'd tell me so I can understand why you are the way you are.

So, basically, my mom would rather believe that I've been raped than understand that I have a mental illness that causes irrational fears and behaviors. I've tried to help her understand for over a year now, and while she's supportive of my treatment and medication, she still doesn't fully understand and I don't think she ever will.

I'm the only non-religious person in my family and they honestly believe that my fears stem from not having full faith in God to take my fear away. I'm not looking for advice on converting them and they certainly don't know I'm non-religious (and never will).

I have honestly thought about telling my mom I was raped by some unnamed person at a random party... just enough to satisfy her without her going further snooping or trying to hurt someone. 

I've tried giving her literature about OCD/depression, but she believes that her helicopter parenting (which was called out by my stepdad who is an awesome guy) is what has caused me to develop my mental illness. She blames herself for my mental illness and no matter how much I assure her that's not the case, she is still convinced. 

If I tell her I was raped, maybe it would give her some amount of comfort. I don't know. I really don't know what to do here. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. What would you guys do?

14916,Non-Romantic,3ds28h,"I met my BF at work. We work for a large advertising agency; I started there right out of college and he transferred to my office (which is the main one) from a satellite office on the west coast. We work in different departments, and met at happy hour soon after he transferred. He was incredibly handsome and kind and I was immediately smitten.

We started eating lunch together and he asked me out on a real date after a few weeks of lunch dates. He told me that he still didn't know the city very well, since he had moved so recently, so I planned a food/drink walking tour, which he loved. I was so happy, because I felt like I really found someone who I connected with, and he was similarly into me.

He cooked for us on our 3rd or 4th date, and after we ate we cuddled on his couch, and he told me that he needed to talk to me about something. I immediately feared the worst, but he quickly assured me that he wasn't going to break up with me. He just told me straight up, he was bisexual and he felt like I needed to know. He said that in the past, some girls had been put off by the fact that he slept with and dated men, some had been really awful and immediately assumed that he would cheat on them left and right with guys (which is incredibly offensive and monogamy is really important to him, as his mother cheated on his dad when he was a kid but that's another story for another day) and felt like he had to tell me, especially before we became sexually intimate (we hadn't gone past heavy petting/making out at that point). To be honest, I was taken aback at first, because I hadn't been expecting it.  I was quiet for a bit, but I realized that it didn't really matter to me at all. I really liked him, and this wasn't something that I felt like was a dealbreaker. This led to us having a heart to heart, and I opened up to him. I'm normally very shy around men (hadn't had a real boyfriend before him, was a virgin, etc) and we talked about our respective baggage, and by the end of the night, I felt closer to him than ever. I think this is when I realized I fell in love with him. We made plans to get STI tested together (even though I hadn't had sex--it was just something I wanted to do with him instead of just putting him on the spot).

Things have been fantastic since then. I love my boyfriend, work is great, our sex life is amazing, and I'm moving in with him at the end of next month when my lease ends. He doesn't have a lot of family, but I've met his dad, who is a wonderful man, and he's met my parents, siblings, and grandparents (I live very near the town I grew up in) and they all love him.

So a few months ago, he got word that a good friend of his from college was getting married, and he asked me if I would come with him as his plus one. I of course said yet, I haven't met many of his friends from before we met and he was really excited that I would meet them.

The wedding was this past Friday, so we flew out late Wednesday night. His friend who was getting married (we'll call him Matt) picked us up at the airport, and Matt was very sweet and I immediately took a liking to him. Matt drove us to our hotel, and told us he would see us in the morning for brunch at his house.

My BF was really excited for brunch, all of his friends would be there and he hadn't seen some of them in quite some time. He told me how he knew that they would love me, etc. I really liked Matt, so I assumed that they would all be like him.

We get to Matt's, which was packed with people. My BF was so excited to see his friends, and proudly showed me off as his girlfriend. I could tell that some of his friends were shocked that I was a girl but that was to be expected, as he told me that he mostly dated guys in college, plus I have a unisex name. Nonetheless, most everyone was really nice, but two guys (we'll call them Tom and Chris) were really weird.

Throughout the day, I didn't want to be that girlfriend, attached to my BF's hip, and I tried to socialize with others. I ended up chatting with Tom and Chris, who my BF lived with his last two years of college. They started making snide, but jokey, comments about me being a female, saying that my BF had changed so much, that they couldn't believe he went to pussy after having cock for so long, said that they couldn't believe he became straight (which is bullshit, because he's not...he's always been bisexual) and it really made me uncomfortable. I excused myself after a while, and went back to my BF and stuck around with him most of the day. I didn't know how to respond, especially since everyone had been drinking, so I just ignored it.

Yesterday was Matt's wedding, which was lovely, but during the reception, Tom was again being really awful. He made rude comments about my body that I don't want to get into but again were under the guise of being friendly ribbing. He immediately clammed up if my BF was nearby, but what he was saying honestly hurt me.

Tom ended up getting wasted at the reception, and cornered me as I was getting myself and my BF another drink and told me that my BF would leave me, my BF was probably already cheating on me because I couldn't satisfy him the way a man would be able to, etc. I knew he was just talking out of his ass but honestly what he said really upset me. I felt awful but I told my BF I wasn't feeling well and that I wanted to go back to the hotel, and he said he would go back with him. I told him he didn't have to, if he wanted to stay I didn't mind, but he said he was tired as well so we went back together.

Right before we went to bed he asked me if I had fun, if I liked his friends, etc, and I told him I did. I didn't want to ruin his day, and we went to bed soon after.

We got back home this morning, and he's been working at his apartment because he has a presentation tomorrow. He texted me earlier, saying that Tom had invited us to something at the end of September and asked if I wanted to go. I haven't responded because I honestly don't want to be around that man ever again. Should I tell my boyfriend about what happened?

Drake is completely obsessed with Rebecca. It’s creepy. He talks to me about how they will have a wonderful future, get married, have kids, and always reminds me how beautiful she is. That’s good and all, but he starts to get into some really creepy things like “fucking her when we’re older” or “jerking off to her every day.” Average for teenagers these days, huh? He is constantly asking me how she is, how was her day, where is she, etc. Very stalker-ish things. (Since Rebecca is ignoring him) I am extremely annoyed because our conversations always have to be about **her**. Not video games, not cats, not school, but her. It even got to the point where I had to get another friend to tell him to ‘stop talking about Rebecca with me.’ 

Anyways, Drake has already asked her out two times already. Both times rejected. It’s been about a year since the rejections. Rebecca just really hates Drake. She tells me that she doesn't want to have a romantic relationship at such a young age, and just doesn't want anything to involve with him. She even told Drake to ‘move on.’ I absolutely respect her opinion. However, Drake doesn't understand this. He still believes that Rebecca and him still have a chance. They don’t. Rebecca is constantly trying to ignore him and doesn't want to see him. Luckily (for her), she and Drake will be going to different high schools. 

Unfortunately , Drake has depression. He’s depressed about multiple things in his life but one of the main reasons is Rebecca. He knows that there might be a slight possibility that he might never end up with her. He told me that “she is the one. If she ends up with another guy, then I’ll just die alone.” As a friend, I’m always there to cheer him up. But to be honest, I feel really guilty. I already told him in the past to move on, but he’s really strong-willed and won’t give up so easily. So what do I do? Telling him to move on again and again won’t help him at all. However, getting back to the ‘she is the one’ part, I need to tell you guys that he liked many girls in the past. MANY. Even me, what the heck? I want him to understand that even if he doesn't end up with her, there are ‘plenty of other fishes in the sea’. We’re 14, what do you expect? But he’ll just deny it, as always. Because *she is the one.*

Now here’s the awkward situation I’m in right now:

Rebecca hates him, and tries to ignore him. She honestly just wants to start a new social life in high school, but he won’t leave her alone, which fuels more hatred inside of her.
  
Drake is depressed, won’t get over her, and probably won’t get over his depression unless he’s on good terms with Rebecca again. He’s also thinking about asking her out again in high school, but I warned him that it won’t go so well. He’s still going for it though. He’ll ask me for relationship advice, since I’m the closest person to her. 

Now…what do I say/do?

**TL;DR: I have a friend [14/M] who’s obsessed with my best friend [13/F], asked her out two times, both times rejected. Refuses to move on. It’s been a year since the rejection. And he also has depression too. But my best friend just honestly wants him to leave her alone.**

14955,Non-Romantic,2a7fa0,"I'm unsure how to proceed after deciding I no longer wanted a particular friend in my life anymore. She's  a person who equates attention with personal validation, and desperately requires social approval in order to be happy. When someone withholds these things from her, as I have now done alongside several other important people in her life, she becomes incredibly insecure and resorts to very counterproductive tactics like anger, lying, gossip, manipulation, revenge-seeking, projection, eating disorders and more. The process is very destructive and ultimately creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which her responses to rejection are causing people to reject her, causing her to have stronger counter-adaptive responses.


She needs some professional help and probably some medication to help her break the cycles of anxiety and paranoia surrounding rejection that are literally running her life.


Now I feel that I'm in an awkward spot because I accidentally ended our friendship in a more dramatic way than I would have liked. I should have told her how I felt calmly and I should have told her a long time ago. But instead I quickly ended the friendship in the heat of a moment, without much explanation.


I feel like I have particular insights that might help her understand herself better and maybe seek help, but now that I've already ended the friendship I feel it isn't my place. I also have no way of predicting how she would respond to hearing that information from me, as a person who is known to have strong negative reactions to social rejection.

**tl;dr**: I don't want to be friends with this girl. But I feel like I should help her. But I don't think she would take my offer of help very well. So should I just do nothing?

14967,Non-Romantic,38k0xj,"Last May 2014, my mother was diagnosed with ALS, you might remember the ice bucket challenge that went around about this disease. Hers is a very slow progressing version, which is good, but ultimately someday she will not be able to live on her own. 

She lives by herself, my alcoholic father divorced her because hes a POS, but thats another relationship. Her house is where me and my two brothers grew up, its a bit house, about 1900 sq ft. Last fall she started having difficulty going up and down the stairs more than a few times a day, she was getting very fatigued doing even the most simple of tasks. She started to wonder how much longer she could live on her own etc. The biggest issue with the house is the stairs and the multiple rooms, which are now daunting to her as her disease progresses. 

Her idea, that she came to me about was if her and I might switch houses. My house is small, its a single story, 2 bedroom, and only 750 sq ft. Everything is pretty new in there. The roof is less than 6 years old, it's got new fixtures, new appliances etc. But the key part is that its a smaller house, one she can navigate herself, one where she could feasibly do her laundry without having to go up and down stairs, get to her kitchen and back with minimal effort etc. My house is ideal for her, and because I have a husband and a toddler, her house is more ideal for us.

The main issue started when I told her I wanted to renovate her house some before we moved in. Her carpet is 35+ years old, the walls are stained with nicotine and tar (shes a VERY heavy smoker, and honestly it's disgusting). She said OK, so I made sure it was really OK and started the renovations. We took the carpet out first, she sat and whined the whole time, saying how embarrassed she was about it etc. We got new laminate flooring to put in, but I wanted to wait until after we were done painting. Now, again, this house is HUGE, and she had Wallpaper borders (three layers deep mind you) around the entire upstairs of the house, including a fully wallpapered bathroom and kitchen. 

I called in the troops, we got the paper down, and painted the dining room, living room, hallway. But we didn't get to the bedrooms because she has stuff piled in them. Our painting was for naught though because she is STILL smoking in the house, so I am going to have to lay down a Second Layer of Killz paint anyways when we do move in. 

I work full time, 5 days a week, 9am - 5:15pm, I leave at 7:45am and get home at 6:30pm daily. I don't have a lot of time. My husband has been plucking at our house daily. We had a tree taken down, so there is clean up from that. Staining the porch, painting the rooms (she hates the color of my house) Installing the new washer and dryer she wanted,I am putting a patio in off the back of my house for her AND we are demolishing the hallway closet to make it wheelchair accessible. The Hallway closet is pretty much the only storage in the house besides the tiny closets in the bedrooms, but she can't get a wheel chair through the hall with it up, so down it's going on Saturday. There is also the issue of the driveway, it's buckling so we are replacing it.

All of these remodeling things she wanted done to my house, I am doing myself (or my husband/brothers etc) plus I am the one with an army of my friends trying to spruce up her house so that it is inhabitable to the point that I won't die of asthma when we move in. 

Here is my issue, shes constantly harping on about how it isn't fair that I am going to have her house put together exactly the way she wanted it, but was never able to do herself. I keep getting these guilt trippy comments about things that I am going to PAY for to fix on her house. She says she is fine with the house switch and the renovations, but then she goes around and tells people that I left her house in a state of disrepair (not true, the floors are not down currently, but we can repair it) and I am just at a loss honestly. 

I get it, this is HER house, she bought it 30 years ago, and now shes moving into a tiny house, where she is slowly going to lose control of her body, eventually being confined to a bed, and then she will die. It's not fair, it isn't fair, and I absolutely hate that it's happening to her, because I love her so much, and I don't want to lose her. 

But, the emotional toll this is taking on me is way more than I can really put into words. Since January of this year I have been coordinating, buying, repairing, fixing, running around, and just trying to get everything done before the June 13th moving day, which is in 1 week. Things are not 100% done yet, I'm running out of time, and instead of offering to help me, or finding someone to help out, all I am getting is this freaking guilt trip because I can't get it done fast enough for her liking. She is absolutely convinced that there is no way we are going to get both houses packed into the moving trucks and moved on the same day. I have two moving trucks coming, and 8 people at each house to move stuff out and in. My house is pretty much packed besides kitchen stuff, and clothes. Her house is pretty much packed besides the same stuff. 

I suppose the advice I am looking for is, how do I bring this up to her? She is legitimately hurting my feelings about the whole thing, and if that is the way she feels about all this work I have put into trying to do this, then quite honestly she can stay in her big house, sell it, and then get an apartment. I will finish the renovations there, but I don't want to switch if I am going to constantly get a guilt trip because I am physically able to do things with her house that she wasn't able to do. It's almost like she is in complete denial that this is happening, and I don't know how to comfort her, or get her to see that she is hurting my feelings during this whole thing. 

**tl;dr**: My mother is dying of ALS, her house is too big for her, she doesn't want to sell it so she offered to switch houses with me, my husband, and my son. Her house is 1900sqft, mine is 750sqft and 1 story. It will be much easier for her to manage, but now that the date is close I am getting a TON of backlash from her, guilt trips, and snarky comments made behind my back. I'm at a loss, and I'm hurt.

A little background: I just moved to a new state about 5 months ago. I've become very close with my neighbors: roommates Smith (31M), Daisy (26F) and Jordon (21M), who live in an apartment near mine. Jordon is in love with Daisy, and Daisy tells Jordon she feels the same way, but is in no place for a relationship right now (Daisy has some addiction problems and tends to choose older men who are usually picked because they supply the alcohol or drugs). This has been going on since I met them a few months ago and Jordon refuses to give up chasing Daisy, who is very beautiful and sexual and charming. 




Recently, however, Daisy has been coming home from work acting like a giddy schoolgirl (her words) and claiming to have fallen in love with a coworker (41M). Jordon has been moody and his roommate Smith (who I'm dating) tells me that the last time Jordon came home, his arms had cut marks on them. We knew Jordon cut in the past, but we haven't seen any evidence that it was still happening/ happening again until now. 




Right now, Daisy and Jordon aren't really talking, so we can't ask her to talk to Jordon. Smith has known Jordon only a couple months longer than I have and isn't as close to him as I am (Jordon tells me everything and says that he wouldn't be where he is in his life today if he didn't have me to talk to). I want to talk to Jordon and help him any way I can, without making him embarrassed or defensive.

14982,Non-Romantic,2dmqp7,"My brother Peter has Down's Syndrome. I love Peter very much and would without question call him the most important person in my life. Ever since we were kids we were very close and my mom often said that I was kind of a second dad in terms of protectiveness and willingness to help out with him after my parents got divorced. Today this translates to mostly babysitting whenever my parents work schedules get hectic or if they want an odd night off. Peter is fairly high-functioning for someone with Down's but my parents understandably don't feel comfortable leaving him alone in the house for long periods of time. Most of the time I'm happy to help and will babysit whenever I can.


Lately however I've been noticing myself becoming less and less enthusiastic to babysit. I think I've just begun to notice how often I'm asked to do it. I would guess I've babysat Peter 4-5 times in the last 2-3 months. My parents always pay me for my services, which I appreciate because it's certainly not something I expect or insist on and hey it's easy money. But at the same time I can't help but feel a little stuck and wonder if it's beginning to interfere with my own life. There are  times where I'm asked to babysit but I just plain can't because of work or because I have something else I need (or want) to do and I end up feeling guilty leaving my parents without someone to watch Peter. For example...


Today my mom asked me to watch Peter next month so that she can go on a cruise with some of her girl friends to celebrate one of their birthdays. She would only need me to watch him one night because my dad's schedule worked out enough that he would be able to watch Peter for the rest of the time. Unfortunately, my friend and I are taking a six hour road trip that weekend to go see a comedian perform and we wouldn't be back in time for me to watch Peter the night she needs me to. This is something we've planned for a month and we've been very much looking forward to it. So because of this, mom might have to skip out on the cruise with her friends. I could hear the disappointment in her voice when I told her this and I immediately felt really guilty. Mom's schedule is very hectic with work and watching Peter and she definitely deserves a break whenever she can get one. She even said something like I never get to do these things watching Peter every other weekend. I suggested that we try to find another babysitter but for whatever reason mom didn't seem too thrilled about the idea.



But in the end, I feel like I deserve a life for myself as well. I don't want to end up as Peter's permanent babysitter, as much as I love him. Sometimes this makes me feel really guilty when I see how much my parents have to work for Peter. How can I build and enjoy a life for myself without feeling like a selfish jerk and while still supporting my family?

A little background, We went to the same college together although not in the same class. We decided after 2 years in college to live together and things were great. We barely ever seen each other at college, I had my friends and he had his. When we spent an evening home together we just chilled and watched TV/played Xbox. When friends came over it was even better as we wouldn't have to interact as much. It was great and barring minor inconveniences, I thought it was a good arrangement. 

Since college, we have gotten a job in the same company. His cubicle is right across the hall from mine, I also live in the same apartment block as him. Lately things have turned sour between us. I can't talk to him as a friend or anything as he is very self-centered. Nothing really matters to him unless he can relate it back to himself or through some story he has experienced. It feels like I'm talking to an obnoxious clever bot. He constantly feels the urge to hum and whistle every song he knows now which is only adding fuel to the fire. Literally I do not posses the vocabulary to explain how much this is annoying me.  He gets very upset over small instances and I'm generally a laid back person but when he gets excited and anxious, it pisses me off further. I don't like telling other people what to do as when people do this to me it gets under my skin. He is only this way with me though as he has very few friends that he can really talk to in his true personality, I have never seen him be rude or obnoxious to other people

1. Everything had to be put into I feel statements or a variation of that.

2. There were not I'm sorry, but you... to turn the blame on each other.

3. Cutting each other off or interrupting was not allowed.

As some of you commented on my original post, my list was overly long so I shortened it and made sure that I left out all the petty comments.  The things that I brought up:
1. Paying bills on time.

2. Cleo's approaching move in, and the need for a back up plan if Cleo does not adjust to life with us or in a small apartment next year.

3. A policy for inviting people over.

4. Locking the door.

Heather brought up:

1. Paying bills on time and in full.

2. Being allowed to bring people over.

3. Gas money (she is the only member of our house who owns a car)

Katie brought up:

1. How she felt brought down by our negativity and questions about her adopting Cleo.

2. Her concern that she wasn't being given enough warning when people came over.

3. Our lack of understanding when she couldn't pay bills on time.

4. That I seemed extra bitchy the past three or four weeks.

5. That I lock the door all the time.

Rachel then opened the floor, and we decided that since Katie called the meeting, she could start.  Katie opened up with how she felt attacked by the fact that I asked so many questions about Cleo, and how things would change once she arrived Saturday.  She felt as if I was beating a dead horse and being very pessimistic.  I agreed that I had been asking a large number of questions, and tried to explain that I was asking so many because I am not excited to have a dog in the house I want to prepare myself and be able to expect.  Katie was frustrated and stated that she feels as if I am looking for things to dislike about Cleo, and trying to find a way to make things not work out.  With Rachel and Heather's help I was able to explain that I am not looking at Cleo's adoption pessimistically, but rather realistically and do not expect everything to be a bed of roses.  Adopting a 4 year-old shelter dog is a wonderful thing to do, BUT it is also a time intensive venture with no guarantee that everything will work out.  Heather built on that explaining that we are happy for Katie but we are not the ones getting a cuddly pet to play with, so we are looking at it from a house keeping perspective rather than a pet owner perspective.  Heather brought to Katie's attention that Cleo is sole the reason that I can no longer bring my cat next, making it even harder for me to be excited.  Katie tried to say that everything will be fine and we need to just stop worrying about it, but Rachel intervened saying that adding an extra living being to our household is a valid thing to be worried about on our part, and that Katie would find relief from our concerns if she could provide answers, a list of expectations, and her plans for how to deal with different scenarios.  We resolved to sit down Monday afternoon (the next time we are all free) and write up a contract spelling out responsibilities and expectations that must be upheld once Cleo gets here.  The contract will include: things Heather and I can help with if necessary, things Heather and I are unwilling/unable to help with, Katie's duties and care plan for Cleo, where Cleo will go if the expectations are not met, her kennel times, food times, locations for her supplies, etc. 

-
Paying bills on time was a big issue and Heather and I both said that this is not something we could compromise on, Katie needed to stop asking us to cover her or let her pay us late.  Katie asserted that it wouldn't happen again so she didn't understand why we were making a big deal out of it.  Katie apparently had some misconceptions about how much money Heather and I have, and did not realize that each of us, at some point had to borrow money from our parents to cover her portion because we did not have enough.  Rachel was able to help us come to the agreement that from our end bills had to be sent to Katie on a specific date, we have has 3 days from that date to pay, if we are late we add whatever the utility late fee would be added onto their bill (I.e. if Katie didn't get me money for the cable bill then xfinity's late fee $6.63 would be added to what she owed me.)  

-
It turns out that because of where Katie lived in Alaska there was never any need for her to lock the door, or carry keys with her.  This is the first time that Katie has lived somewhere with other people who do feel that the door needs to be locked, so it's completely foreign to her and she was annoyed at having to carry keys.  Rachel was able to explain to Katie that my desire to have the door locked was normal for where we live, and is a very real and important safety issue.  It was agreed upon that from now on the front and back doors will locked whenever the house is left empty, and that after 10pm the front door will be chained.  Katie is frustrated that she will have to carry her keys now, but does understand why leaving the house unlocked bothered me.

-
Heather apparently had also had problems with Katie recently concerning having people over and was the driving force behind this point.  Katie said that she finds people being here distracting and has been struggling to focus, which is why she started vetoing guests recently, but understands that we are allowed to have people over.  The three of us decided that anything over 4 people necessitated a head up, and that on school nights no more than two people are allowed to stay past 11pm without permission from everyone who will be home.  If guests who were previously okayed to stay past 11 become too loud, we will ask the roommate they are with quiet them down, if they do not then they will be asked to leave.  Weekends are fair game, provide that 24 hours notice is given for anything big, however until Cleo is acclimated to our house we will not be throwing any ragers. 
It was also decided that guests staying longer than 3 days needed extended warning and can be vetoed.  Katie suggested that anyone staying longer than a week should be added to the utility bills.  (I.e. If I had a guest for a week, then the utility bills would be split between 3.25 people instead of 3 people and I would pick up 42% of the bills while Katie and Heather would each have 29% of the bills.)

-
Heather felt disrespected because Katie would ask for rides, but never offer gas money.  A compromise was reached that once a semester Katie and I would separately pay to fill up Heather's car rather than giving her gas money every time.

-
The last topic was that Katie felt as though I'd become bitchier the past few weeks.  I explained to her that in part that was because of how quickly the adoption process had gone with Cleo and I was frustrated because I felt as though my concerns weren't being addressed when I brought them to her.  I also apologized, because I know that I have been more stressed than normal since Spring Break, and my boyfriend's recent move has been tough on me, so I have been a little on edge and just hadn't noticed how much it was slipping into my voice and interactions.

Despite it being stressful, I feel as though the meeting was definitely a good thing and hopefully things will remain better.  Afterwards it was nice to sit and just hang out with them after the tension had cleared from the room.

Usually I wouldn't take to social media about these things, but I figure at least one of you guys on here would give some decent/positive advice on how to deal with friendship breakups, because maybe some of you have been in this situation before.


So, my best friend just ended our friendship. 

Background: We met at our workplace. We've worked together for the past year at the same job, but hadn't gotten close until about 7 or 8 months ago when we started spending a lot of time together. We bonded over a lot of things and found out we were very similar. Since we went to the same school (though we had no classes together) and worked at the same place, it was not hard for to find something to talk about in the beginning. Our friendship moved past school and work, and although we would see each other between classes or at work, we would also make time for each other outside of all that. When the semester ended we continued to hang out. 


Her boyfriend broke with her back in April (around the same time my own relationship was budding) and I was the one that she called crying, and I was the one who talked her through the breakup. I was the one who was there for her whenever she needed to vent or talk, literally there 24/7 for her. I prioritized our friendship because she was going through a rough time. Even when I was spending time with my boyfriend, I would still respond to her messages and take her calls to try to be there for her. Even though it would interfere sometimes, I still tried my best to be a good friend. 


About a week after getting out of a relationship she had a thing with a new guy. With this new guy came new problems and new heartbreak, which I continued to hear about but still supported her. 


*Fast forward* to maybe about 3 weeks ago when she started getting distant. I let it be for a few weeks, but things got weird when I would see her but she would barely speak to me at all. She also stopped responding to my messages whenever I would try to talk to her she would brush me off or not respond. Finally about 2 days ago I asked her what the hell was going on with us and she told me. Her response was long, but she basically said that me asking her for stressed her out because it reminded her of her past relationship and she really didn't need that. I was really hurt that she wasn't there for me when I needed to talk about things yet I had been there for her so many times in the past. I understand that the timing of our romantic relationships (mine starting as hers was ending) was really unfortunate, but I really thought our friendship had been stronger than this. 


   
TL;DR my best friend broke up our friendship because she said me asking her for advice stressed her out (see details in last paragraph above). Am i overreacting by being so upset about this?

We have an end of the year project which is basically whatever the hell you want for linear data structures. The requirement is just that it shows you know the material basically. A lot of people are doing small projects (reading through a phone book and finding all palindrome names is one. And that group has 4 people).

I decided to work with the traveling salesman problem and evolutionary algorithms. 

**Technical mumbo jumbo below it's not necessary but it proves that I actually did enough (more than fucking enough) for this assignment.**

------------------

The program I created which is due at the end of the year (which still has a bit but I started way early) is basically 4 separate programs.

The first uses a genetic evolutionary algorithm I made to solve the travelling salesman problem. 

The second program uses  the nearest neighbor algorithm to solve the problem. 

The third program uses a brute force method just calculating every possible combination.

Finally the fourth problem randomly generates the cities each of these programs need to visit and tests the time it takes each of them to find the optimal route and also the approximate error when it comes to NN algorithm. It goes up to N cities and increments by one city each time and runs the program. If computation time of one of the algorithms is way too long it suspends and moves onto the next algorithm.

My mother had a very ugly divorce from him after my sister and I had moved out. He had hidden money from her and was able to afford a better lawyer so he basically took her to the cleaners and she has been struggling since. He moved into an apartment and eventually bought a house with the money he got from the divorce. My mother and I have been to AA meetings and have tried to support each other the best we can, but she was never able to cut off ties with him.

The past few years he has turned into a recluse due to his drinking. Thankfully he does not drive while drinking, but that means he would not leave the house to get food and supplies for long periods of time. During all this time he is getting sicker and sicker; losing teeth, becoming emaciated, etc. But still my mother would call him frequently to check up on him and help him in any way she can. 

Last year he reports to her that he thinks he had a mild stroke. We all agree that the symptoms sound like a stroke, and I finally get up the courage to see him and ask him to see a doctor but he refuses and has not seen a doctor since. Since then he has gotten significantly sicker and my mother confesses to me that for the past few months she has been doing all his grocery shopping and chores since he can barely move around the house and can barely speak. Now he is telling her that he finally thinks it's time to go to a doctor or hospital since he thinks that his body is finally failing him. 

I want to be there for my mother since I know she still loves him, but I have had a lot of anger and resentment towards him for a long time and I have tried to distance myself from him for many reasons. He was always very selfish and cruel towards my mother and has done things in my eyes that are unforgivable. I am being pressured by the rest of my family to be a, good daughter and help out more since he is probably dying, but I have no desire to be a part of any of this. 

I am not close with my extended family so I don't really have anyone to go to for advice. His drinking and illness was always kept very private and only we know what is going on. I feel as though I should have written him off long ago, but now I am in a very hard place.

15059,Non-Romantic,1vkvsz,"This is probably going to be fairly long, so please bare with me. 

  To acquaint you guys with my work setting, I work in a cookie shop in my neighboring town's local shopping mall.  I work with *all* females with the exception of my male manager.  I'm the youngest of everybody there, the second youngest being a senior in high school and 17 years old.  (I'm a junior)  I get along with all of my co-workers and have even formed friendships with the majority of them.  (Mostly those in which I work with more frequently)  My male manager is very fond of me and we even speak like friends during our down time.  He's awesome and I think it's mainly due to the fact that we have that mutual 'respect'..being the only dudes in that joint.  

  My typical day is I come in, stock up on stuff, help customers for a few hours, take my break, come back, help customers, then I either close the register, do the dishes, or handle the sweeping and mopping along with taking out the trash and boxes to the bins outside.  I have always been quite a slow learner. (it may be relevant that all throughout elementary school I was diagnosed with ADHD and put on medication for it, I no longer take medication)  I would often forget to do things, sometimes I wouldn't do something a certain way, or anything of the like and my female manager would get visibly frustrated with me.  Understandable enough.  

*Now this is where things get very suspicious..* 

She treats me different, this much is plainly obvious.  I've noticed it, my co-workers have noticed, hell I think even my male manager has noticed but hasn't said anything to protect his sister's position as manager.  (Both my managers are brother and sister, by the way)  I'm going to start off with describing how she simply speaks to me.  The way she communicates with me is that of someone trying to get someone with mentally retardation to understand their words.  She looks at me to the side, with a look resembling are you fucking stupid? and speaks real slow.  Also her greeting to me is nothing in comparison to the gitty, candy-ass greeting she gives to the rest of my co-workers.  (Maybe it's simply because I'm a guy?  I don't know.)  
Now I'm going to go into the tasks she has me do.  This is where things get very noticeable.  Every time my co workers are standing around doing nothing, she'll get mad at me for ignoring certain tasks AS I'M DOING SOMETHING ELSE and yet my co workers are just dawdling.  And I get bitched at for not doing what I'm supposed to be doing, completely ignoring the fact that I'm the one taking a personal initiative to get shit done early while everyone else just does nothing.  

Every single day I go out of my way to be as nice as possible to her, but nothing every works.  I'm 100% convinced she has some hate towards me.  I understand I can be difficult with my slow learning and what not but I put in 110% there and I always will.  She finds something wrong in EVERYTHING I do, literally, everything.  Even one of my co workers, (who has been there for about 3 years) said that she was on my ass about everything and simply wouldn't just shut the hell up.  Even when I'm doing something THE EXACT same way she showed me how to do it, she'll jump in and fix it and tell me I did it wrong then smile at the customer and apologize and say sorry, he's still training.  This shit pisses me off so much.  I try and try and try my hardest to do things the right way, and I DO, yet there is always something wrong.  I see my co workers doing things wrong all the time that my manager sees, yet she decides to say nothing and with me there are always words to be said.  Seriously?  

There was even one time where she was showing me how to do something that I've never been trained to do (and believe me, I would remember) and she said this is the third time I've showed you how to do this.  I knew it was bullshit, SHE knew it was bullshit.  But what in the world could I have said at that point?  This job is seriously something I'm super proud of and I do not want to get fired, so I mostly just bite the bullet and don't say anything out of place.  

  It's also very important to note that when she's not there and I work with my male manager I do everything the same way and at the end of the day he compliments me on my good work, pats me on the back and we all leave for the night.  Yet with her she's complaining THE WHOLE DAY ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAMN THING I DO.  I just wish someone would give me some possible reasons as to why in the world someone would act this way.  I've always been super nice to her, at the end of every night I offer to stay unpaid time after and assist her with anything that she may need help with like heavy lifting.  (She often has me do tasks that involve heavy lifting, which I'm totally okay with and I am glad to help out with)  So I don't see why she'd act this way.  All the people here that are newer than me don't even get the same treatment I do.  

I even told my parents about this and my mother's guess what that she just hates men.  I discarded that thought as to me it sounds silly but now I really have no other way to explain it haha.  

I just don't get it.  She's always telling me watch your co-workers, and how they do things, learn from them.  And she's referring to people that **ARE NEWER THAN ME!!** I even get blamed for their fuck ups all the time and even when they go out of their way to defend me (which I hugely appreciate) she still scolds me for something they did.  

It's to the point to where I literally just get nervous around her.  To the point to where doing certain tasks like closing register I find myself visibly shaking because I'm so scared of her now.  I've come home feeling like a worthless piece of shit every night because I don't feel as if I'm doing my job right, even though I get congratulated when she's not around.  I have considered looking for new work, just plain accepting that I'm no good for that place and she's eventually going to fire me.  I've now started to come to the revelation that she's probably literally acting out of personal feelings, and going beyond the regular employer to employee and I honestly just do not know what to do.  

**TL;DR**:  I feel as if female manager hates me.  Talks to me like idiot, constantly finds things wrong with what I do even when done right, makes things up to make me seem like I'm a bad worker, goes out of her way to treat co workers better than me (they've noticed this), and scolds me for shit she knows I don't do.

She has to send out boxes upon boxes of marketing crap a few times a month, and decides to use my desk and chair area, whether I'm physically there or not.  We're talking piles and piles of junk, boxes, tape, packing materials, etc.  She also makes as much noise as humanly possible while doing it, so much that it is impossible for me to be on the phone, or even think while she's doing it.  And she does it right next to me.  

She has set VERY heavy boxes on top of my purse, my cell phone, etc.  She pushes my chair, slams things onto my desk, etc.  I've asked her many times, very nicely to stop.  I've inquired as to why she cannot use her GIGANTIC corner office, or the conference room, or the breakroom, or any other location in the office, and she just ignores me.

I went to my boss and HR many, many times over this.  They just keep telling me to wait, that I'll eventually be moved.  There has been no action from them to resolve the situation.

Today I lost it.  I'm battling some health issues, so I already feel like crap.  I was away from my desk for 30 minutes helping another coworker, and I come back and there is stuff EVERYWHERE.  On my keyboard, on my chair, everywhere.  I walked in and asked her if she could move it.  I GUESS *YOU* can put it on the floor.  I lost it.  I told her she needed to get her shit off my desk and to stop hindering me from working.  She made a point to put more things on my desk and make more noise.

He's not aggressive, he's a very awesome guy who really does care about others... I just don't think he can literally comprehend the consequences of his actions.

Now before you ask why we keep helping him... It's because he has two children. He is still with the mother, but it's off and on. My nephews are the best thing that's happened to our family. We can't block him from our lives because of this. I love my brother, and I want help for him so badly. I think I'm just looking for advice. I want to sit him down and talk to him, but I wouldn't even know where to begin. If anyone has any suggestions... Or really any advice, I'd appreciate it.

15098,Non-Romantic,33kzje,"I'm at a loss reddit. Forgive me if any of this becomes messy. 
My friend, we'll call her Fe has a roommate who we will call Mike. Mike and Fe consider each other to be close to best friends. In fact Fe is one of Mike's only friends, aside from Fe's boyfriend. 

Fe only recently moved into Mike's home. One night while both of them were drunk, Mike took advantage of Fe sexually. I do not know the extent of this, however I do know 

* it was definitely of a sexual manner

* Fe did not consent or want this

* Fe felt traumatized and wished it had never happened and even had some thoughts which I would categorize as suicidal as a result.

Kinda sounds simple enough right? 

Wrong. After this whole incident, as they were still living in the house Mike and Fe agreed over text to talk it over. Mike insists that he does not remember it happening, although doesn't deny it did. He says he feels disgusted by what happened and he is very remorseful. As a result of this Mike and Fe have gone back to being friends. To be fair I do believe he is genuinely remorseful.

Every fiber of my being tells me that this feels wrong. Fe contacted me after the incident and she was clearly traumatized by the whole event. Objectively I can't comprehend how in any situation someone can sexually assault someone and they remain friends, and this be okay. This is an experience she can never forget and as she has a history of self harm and depression I worry for her mental health in the long-term, will pretending it never happened come back to bite her in the ass?
At the end of the day, no matter how remorseful he is, I believe you can not change the fact that he sexually assaulted her.
The fact that he was also drunk makes it more messy as well. If he doesn't remember it then does that change the situation? Or does it not because being drunk doesn't changes someone's morales and values. Conveniently I must add this situation occurred only a few days after Fe moved in.

Other details that may be relevant include the fact that Mike has only ever had one relationship, funnily enough with me. We ended on very unhealthy terms and I am longer friends with him because I resent him for how he treated me during our relationship. I believe he has unhealthy views of women and he was extremely selfish in our relationship, and only ever cared about his pleasure. His only other female friend is no longer friends with him as one day at a pool party he kept talking about her breasts to his other friends, and after they all left he proceeded to masturbate (which he admitted to when a friend returned to pick up something he had left behind and he wouldn't answer the door). All female friends he has ever had, I feel he has viewed in a very unhealthy sexual light. There's no crime in thinking sexually of people, but I think it's different when they're your friend and you do it to such an extreme.

I am afraid that my friend is normalizing the situation and a part of her has accepted it as she believes she deserves it, even though I have tried my best to reinforce that none of it was her fault. She wishes to pretend it never happened and move forward. He doesn't want to throw away their friendship over this. 

Reddit please advise me as to what you think of this situation. Ask me further questions to clarify the situation, tell me if you think ultimately I need to leave the situation alone. I want what is best for my friend.

15110,Non-Romantic,24gta2,"So my brother is going to school right now, he was in the Navy and now receives monthly payments from them for being honorably discharged. I think it's around $1,700, and then he gets paid on top of that for going to school, and his schooling is 100% free.           
            
I work full time (well, I did, more on that later) for $9.25 an hour which is  $2 over minimum wage, so my paychecks are normally around 450-500 and I get paid every two weeks, so on a bad month I can earn 700, on a good month I'll earn around 1,000.                  
             
We share a car right now because his car broke down and he's in the process of fixing it at his school. Monday thru Friday from 6 AM to about 630 PM he has the car. Before, he would take me to work on his way to school in the morning and our grandma would pick me up from work when I was done. She ended up being scheduled for knee surgery so obviously she couldn't drive me if she got it done, which is why I cut my work hours to weekends only. Some things went wrong and she ended up having to reschedule the surgery for June 4th, so there's no point in my changing my availability back to normal because it takes 2-3 weeks to change it, then 2-3 to change it again (which i'd have to if my brother's car wasn't fixed by June 4th). I called my boss and told him to call me in if they got a call off or if they needed extra help that day, but so far they haven't called, so I've been using some vacation time and personal hours to hopefully fill the monetary void.              
               
So anyway, my cut in pay has led to me asking my brother to take over our cell phone bill. Both of our phones are on it, I have been paying it since we got the phones, I even paid the security deposits and the price of his phone. He wanted the iPhone 5 and with a new line activation it was $100, then it was $150 to security deposit. The first bill I received was $423 because they charge for the month ahead, which means the first bill was the month we got it, then the month after it. Ever since I have been paying $180 a month for these phones. Obviously $180 can be pricey if you're only working 8 hours a week, which is why I asked him to pay for it until I can go back to work full time.                
             
So the other day, Sunday, I told him our phone bill was due tomorrow, the 28th, and he said he could pay it Wednesday, but no sooner. I told him it wasn't a big deal, I could pay it so long as he paid me back Wednesday. So we agreed and I paid it, the next morning I looked at my bank account and somehow the garbage bill posted that day, when I thought it posted days ago, and my account overdrafted because of the phone bill being taken out as well. So now I'm $-23 on my bank account and our netflix fee wouldn't go through today because my bank account is overdrawn and the netflix is linked to my card.           
                
Yesterday I texted him and told him he could just deposit the money into my bank account if there's a bank near his school, which there should be because it's a fairly common bank, but he didn't respond to it, but I know he read it because he came home with milk, which was my other text I sent after the text about the money.                    
               
When he didn't say anything about the money, I went to my mom asking her what I should do, and she said just to ask him. Well yesterday he was in a pissy mood, which is pretty common because he has mental issues, so I didn't really want to upset him by pushing the matter. I did end up asking him when he didn't seem to be in such a bad mood, I tried to lighten the question by telling him I did some of his laundry, but I didn't get very far and by the end of the day, I still haven't seen my $180.                      
                    
I've borrowed money from him before and have paid him back as soon as I told him I would, but he's never really borrowed money from me but I didn't really think it was going to be this difficult to get the money back. I planned on seeing my boyfriend next week with that money (he lives an hour away and I haven't seen him for 3 weeks).                  
                  
I mean, I guess I can't really complain because I wanted to use the $180 for something recreational, but that means I've spent my whole paycheck on all bills, meanwhile I know my brother has already bought recreational things with his money and doesn't pay any bills aside from his car payment and the gas he uses to go to school, which is about 45 minutes away. I think it's completely fair for him to have to pay for our phones for a few months since I've been paying the bill in the past. I also bought groceries this month and the garbage bill and the agreement was originally that I paid for the groceries and garbage and he pays the phone bill, because I told him I couldn't afford to do all 3.                  
                  
So do I keep bringing it up, get my mom involved, or drop it? How can I go about getting my money back without seeming like a bitch? I feel bad because it's money I want to spend on visiting my boyfriend, and it's not like I need it, but my boyfriend's been stressed with graduation coming up and I haven't seen him for so long and I really miss him, but at the same time I'm pissed because my brother and I had an agreement and he buried his head in the sand.                    
                    
**tldr** brother and I agreed that he would pay the phone bill if I bought groceries and paid the garbage bill, he told me he couldn't pay the bill til Wednesday, so I paid the bill because he said he would pay me back, it's Thursday and I still haven't seen the money after asking him twice for it.",I (22F) can't get my brother (24M) to pay me back.,0.0,False,3.0,10.0,1398962061.0,/r/relationships/comments/24gta2/i_22f_cant_get_my_brother_24m_to_pay_me_back/,NonRomantic

Welp, she's still here with no real prospects for moving out next week.  She has looked at 3 apartments in the 23 days she has been here. Three.  This weekend has been perfect weather and she has not looked at a single apartment. 

She's not a bad person, She's nice, and is overall a considerate roommate (cleans up after herself and such) but I just don't want her here anymore. She's just an overall drama queen that gives every reason under the sun why things aren't working out for her and it's not my problem.

A little over 2 years ago, my friend had what one could only assume should have been a one night stand which was incredibly unusual for her. She met him in a college class when he asked for the notes since he didn't like going to class, took her for coffee, and not even a few hours later they were going at it in her room without protection which was also unusual for her. She messaged me, freaking out the next morning, wondering if I'd go with her to get Plan B because she did something incredibly stupid and wasn't sure if he'd follow through and pick some up for a friend. He did, later that day, and I figured that would hopefully be the end of whatever they had. 

But nope. They eventually considered themselves exclusive and started dating. She became incredibly dependent upon him almost immediately - constantly texting him wherever she was (in class, hanging out with me etc), ditching me and our plans for him, dragging him along when I'd ask her to go someplace. I never liked him even before this was happening, couldn't figure out why. About halfway through the semester she found out he was sexting other women - asking for inappropriate pictures as well. She freaked, smacked him away and apparently after arguing managed to forgive him.

At this point I massively disliked him, because I've gone through a similar thing and I absolutely hate cheaters. I told her that I would still hang out with her, but I NEVER wanted him around me and that I would appreciate it if she stopped talking to me about him (almost every sentence contained some information about him whenever she talked to me. Her life really revolved around him). I still couldn't believe she trusted him - he would have a female friend stay with him in his room for periods of time and he refused to tell this friend that he was in a relationship - giving the excuse that his friend would be extremely upset with him and he didn't want to cause drama. If that wasn't a massive red flag, I don't know what is. 

They started living together and no longer attended school with me due to financial reasons. Just recently she moved back home with him staying there and I finally got around to talking to her about why. Turns out she found him sexting other women again - people he's met and potentially flirted with (maybe done more with) in public. She said she could no longer trust him and he promised to get into therapy (although he's been in therapy for years now) thinking that would make everything better. 

I'm not sure what they are right now. She claims that they're only friends because she could never trust him again - yet she drives hours to visit him once a month and I'm sure they're sleeping together yet. She guilts him into paying for everything when she visits him saying that he owes her. She's pushing the blame of what he's doing to the women he's been sexting - contacting the girl and telling her he's in a relationship and to back off. Then she tells him that she knows the girls name/number/address and if she EVER finds out he was doing something like that again she'll go over there and make this girls life a living hell and he'll have to live with the guilt that he caused that to happen. This is what leads me to believe she's still considering herself with him because she's so flippin' dependent upon people and it pisses me off that she's blaming the other woman instead of the idiot she's with. I just want to shake some sense into her, but don't know how or what to say.

15169,Non-Romantic,287ysj,"This might be long but I'll try and keep it as short as possible. Also bear with me, this might seem a little high school but I'm really unsure of how to handle this situation correctly.

I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years and he's always had this female friend, we'll call her Jane.

At first I was a little weary of her, being that she is a lot like me, I'm not going to lie I felt a little threatened.

He talked to her a lot, I mean a lot, and sometimes prioritized time with her over me.

When we first started dating he told me right off the bat he would never stop talking to her and that a couple of his exes had a problem with her and wanted him to choose, and that he wouldn't be doing that.

So I did have some reasons to be suspicious of her, and when I told him that it bothered me the amount that they talked and sometimes how he prioritized it, he didn't budge and told me I'm going to have to trust him. That nothing is going on between them.

Soon after, she added me on Facebook. She messaged me and made it a point to talk to me. It came to the point where I even heard from her more than my bf did. So I started feeling better about the situation and trusted it. She seemed to be trying to alleviate any fears I had.

I didn't think anything of how much she messaged me, though. Nor did I think anything when she liked a lot of my pictures. I just started to consider her a friend rather than her being just my boyfriend's friend.

I've had a guy friend, we'll call him John, for years. We're not as close as my boyfriend and Jane, but we still have kept in contact since high school. 

He has had a lot of bad luck in relationships and 7 months ago asked me if I had any friends I could set him up with. Because she's similar to me and really seemed good for John, I thought of Jane.

At first they seemed to really get along. We'd even go on double dates all the time.

But she would want to go on double dates with us more than she wanted to go on dates alone with him. 

After a while he told me how she would ditch his plans often, and seemed to be losing interest.

He once told me how she was pressuring him asking if he would sleep with any of his female friends, who would he pick. He thought she was being jealous. But mentioned how she said she would sleep with me if she were him. Then started talking about threesomes and how she wouldn't mind if I had one with them because she trusts me.

He told me she would talk about me a lot too, and I just figured it was her being fond of me, and was glad to have a good friend.

I understand a lot of this shows some red flags here and there, but I wasn't looking for any so I didn't pay any attention to them.

They just recently broke up and John acted funny toward me. He wouldn't really answer my texts when I tried to console him. I pried a lot and I realize that was really stupid of me but I really wanted to help him.

He told me she'd confessed to having feelings for me that she couldn't get over and broke up with him.

He seemed to be blaming me over these things and was mistrustful of me. I tried to tell him I didn't do anything wrong, I have a boyfriend so it's not like I was encouraging her feelings or anything. I told him I have no idea. He doesn't believe me.

I told my boyfriend about this situation, more so ranting about it and trying to figure out what to do.

And now my boyfriend is very angry with Jane. He said he feels she was using him to get to me. He is angry that she stopped talking to him as much once she became friends with me. He thinks that she's being a shitty friend because (his words) she is trying to steal his girlfriend. I personally don't feel she was actively trying to get with me, I think she just had feelings that she was trying to ignore and hoping would go away but they didn't.

He told me he's not going to be friends with her anymore and messaged her telling her off.

Then a day after that I got a text from her. Basically it was her saying she had feelings for me since she met me but is so sorry that they got worse and she didn't distance herself from me. She told me she's always been confused about her sexuality and she really thinks that she is not into men, at all. 

She told me that it's really hard for her and now she's lost a friend in me, my boyfriend, and John. She said she cares for us all a lot and didn't mean to hurt anyone. She said that her family already doesn't want much to do with her when she told them she might not be straight in the past (they're religious).

I wanted to text her back. I feel bad for this girl. I really do. 

My boyfriend was with me when I got the text. He told me I better not write her back because I'll be betraying him and that he wants me to delete her number and never talk to her again.

I feel conflicted. I feel like it will ruin my relationship with my boyfriend and friendship with John if I keep in contact with Jane. But I feel horrible for this girl. 

She's going through a lot with her sexuality and no one is accepting of it. She was just trying to be honest with me, my boyfriend, and John by telling us. I don't feel she was doing anything purposely vindictive. But maybe I'm ignorant.

I also can't help but feel my boyfriend is being a hypocrite since he refused to do anything back when he was talking to her too much and I had anxiety that things were going on, and that he refused in the past with past gfs and always chose her over them, but now is essentially asking me to do the same thing. 

And as for my friend John, I feel a little angry with him as well. For blaming me and not trusting me more even though we've been friends for a long time. I feel like it means nothing to him if he's going to throw it away because of this.

And I'm also conflicted because I also don't want to lead Jane on by staying friends with her. I'm not sure if it would help her or harm her if I were to stick to my guns and be there for her right now. Because I am straight and don't have feelings for her but I do care about her as a friend.

There's not really anyone I can talk to about this, since the 3 people I usually went to for support are all part of this situation.

When my sister came along 4.5 years after me my parents spoiled her to make up for what my grandparents did with me. She grew up feeling very entitled because my parents always told her how unfair it was she had to deal with being the second and apparently less liked grandchild. I was a kid so I never really understood but as I got older I could see how my grandparents did treat me better but never understood why this made it ok for my sister to get a present, tell my parents it was the wrong one or color and she didn't want it and that be ok. I was never like that.


Our mom died when I was 22 and she was 17. My dad (and us all) has tried to be supportive of her since as thats a bad age to lose someone. That was 3 year ago and she will use that as an excuse all the time.



**Current situation:**


Sister is 20, never worked, still a year or two out from finishing high school with barely passing marks, will not learn to drive, goes out and parties every night and stays up all night. Sleeps 2-9 most days. Lives at home rent free, doesnt help out because she is an adult and doesnt have to do what anyone tells her anymore and just causes a lot of stress for my dad. He is totally heart broken over my mom still and she is the last daughter at home (two brothers in grade school still living with him) and he is afraid if he does anything to push her she'll take off. Since she has no concept of money or responsibility shed likely turn to rather unpleasant career options and my dad is terrified of that.


I love her dearly but I am too hard on her sometimes. I want her to succeed and know its possible even when life is tough. I graduated college on time and with extremely high marks even though my mom died right in the middle of it, I just know she can make it through high school and work a fast food job if she really tried. She doesnt drive either and constantly calls asking for things or for rides to see her friends, I am so busy with working a full time job and planning my wedding I have no time to drive across town for her. I go over once or twice a week to help them with homework after I get off work and buy groceries and get dinner so I do what I can when I am there for her when it comes to homework and offer to give her driving lessons.


I asked her to be a bridesmaid because I want her to be a part of my day and want to include her. It has been hell. I have to buy her everything drive her to every event and I dont even really mind that stuff. Its the constant asking for more and never thanking me and being a spoiled brat about everything. Had to drive almost 2 hours to get her to/from my bridal shower and she didnt even offer a gift (didnt want one but any mention would have been nice) or even help clean up. I have a torn shoulder even and she sat on her phone watching me and my MIL clean up for 2 hours after and then got mad I wouldn't drive her to her friends house on the way home because it was out of the way.

Blew me off 3 times to take her shopping for her dress, literally forgot and didnt tell me she wasnt going to be around when I showed up to get her and drove across town for her. When she finally did go she complained the whole time I wouldnt let her go off on her own and just put in her headphones the entire time. She eventually just left me anyways and went and used her last $20 for an ipod case and earrings. I spent over $300 on her and my brothers clothes for the wedding and when I asked her to buy herself the pair of $12 shoes we found for her she refused saying she had nothing left after leaving and going to buy herself that stuff. I bought them anyways.

We get in the car and she tells me she isnt sure she can be near my other bridesmaids because they are all bitches who havent gotten their dresses yet and since she is the only one that has she just isnt sure she can be at the salon with us when we all get our hair done.

We get home, I get no thank you, but instead asked for a ride and I decline as its late Sunday night and I am tired and have early meetings the next day. She just scoffs and mutters something and walks away. No thank you for spending all that time and money on her or anything just annoyance I wont do more.

I am at my wits end with her. I love her and she is hurting me beyond repair with some of her behavior. That is just the latest mess with her. My fiance, who normally has more patience for her than I, has even called her up and told her how shitty she is being.

I dont want to damage our relationship anymore but I dont know what to do. I cant just sit by why she treats everyone like this. I dont want to even look at her anymore.

**TL;DR:** Sister is VERY ungrateful. Spoiled as a kid and now 20 with no job, doesnt know how to drive, failing out of school, and just expects everyone to do everything for her with very little thanks. Asked her to be my bridesmaid, she had done nothing to help and I have had to buy her everything and drive her everywhere. She just keeps asking for more and more and I can't handle her anymore. What do I do?

**EDIT: I dont normally do ANYTHING aside from homework help for her. For my wedding since I want her in it I knew I had to do the things to make that happen. I never drive her or buy her anything aside from stuff for my wedding. The food I mentioned is in regards to buying my family dinner and she will be at home sometimes and eat some of it but its not directly for her. I stopped doing anything for her when she turned 19 hoping shes learn to drive and get a job but my dad still does most things for her so it hasnt gotten any better.**

15178,Non-Romantic,2szx47,"Background: One of my [25F] best friends, Mark [24M] has been dating Emily [28F] for about a year and a half. They're a nice couple, albeit completely absorbed in each other and somewhat co-dependent, I rarely see him on his own anymore. Mark has always been super serious about his relationships and fell hard for Emily very quickly and she seemed to feel the same about him.


The problem: I was recently at a party where I met Emily's most recent ex Derek [36M]. We were chatting and I mentioned something about my friend Mark and then Derek mentioned that he used to date Emily and knew about Mark and Emily's current relationship. Derek made a few comments about how things would never have worked out with for him with Emily because she was so much younger than him. He then started telling me about how when Emily and Mark first started dating she had told Derek about her and Mark's problems in their sex life and went on to tell me that Mark couldn't get it up for the first month or so they were together. I was shocked, and uncomfortable, I was sure this wasn't information Mark would have wanted me or anyone other than Emily to know. It seemed like a huge betrayal of trust that Emily told HER EX about Mark's private problems. I ended the conversation with Derek quickly, and haven't run into him since.


I've now spent a lot of time debating whether Derek could be lying (I don't think he was?) or if there could be ANY plausible reason why Emily would have told an ex such intimate details about her relationship with Mark. And most importantly I've been trying to decide if I should tell Mark. I don't want to embarrass him or make him uncomfortable by bringing up something without being sure, and I really don't want to seem like I'm accusing Emily of anything without strong proof. But he's one of my best friends and I want to make sure I'm being a good friend to him.


It's made more complicated because Mark and Emily got engaged over the holidays and have recently set a date for October. I don't want to cause trouble, but I'm a little worried about my friend and this relationship. Should I say something to him, or do I keep it to myself?

We have yet to discuss specifics, but he is offering a partnership, which would include access to his established software, business contacts, and his experience. 

While it is a great opportunity, I have taken a test run of his software, and don't love it. I would like to develop my own, but his, along with his branding, is something that seems non-negotiable. I would like to have a relationship in which we bounce ideas off each other, and he has mentioned that this would be an option, but is really trying to sell the partnership route. 

My question is, how do I politely decline this partnership offer without burning the bridge? I get a feeling from him that he is very proud of his software and branding, and anything alluding to a rejection of it will be taken as an insult. He does have experience in the industry, and I am very interested in this, but not to have to deviate from the path I would like to take the company.

15188,Non-Romantic,25wgiq,"So there's this girl that. She's a foreign exchange student [17 F] and is pretty amazing. She and I had our math classes at the same time but not in the same room. She does however have it in the classroom across from me. Well I'd catch her looking over at me and same goes for me.

Well one night I was at a dance and she was there with her friends. I ended up asking her to dance and she agreed. We danced until she had to leave. I'd say that we hit it off. I waited for about a day to go by before asking her if she'd like to go out for lunch some time. She said yes and then gave me her number. But before giving me her number asked if she knew that she was leaving about a month and a half. I told that I knew that and she smiled and said Alright!. She did however tell me that she doesn't check her phone that often so if she didn't reply that was why. We went out for lunch and again, hit it off.

We continued to talk to each other and what have you. Well after a week or so, I then asked her if she wanted to hangout and she over course agreed. I texed her that Friday before and she said that she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to hangout because her host family was moving but that we could go out to eat again some time next week. I told her that it was all good and that it was understandable. I also offered to help them move. She said Alrighty, thanks:)

I was pretty bummed that we couldn't hangout but I was excited that I still got to go out with her. Well I tried texting her that Sunday and she didn't reply. I thought nothing of it because I figured that she was still moving. That Monday I didn't see her at school. I knew that she hadn't left for home yet because she told me that she wasn't leaving for another month or so. I tried texting her and again no reply. I let a couple of days pass and she still wasn't at school. I sent her one more text. She didn't reply.

She ended up not coming to school at all this last week and she never replied to my text. I feel like I'm being annoying. I've been talking to a friend and he said I should wait to see if she's there this week before sending another text. 

I know it's not the best idea to get involved with a foreign exchange student so close to her leaving but I really like her and I'm pretty sure she likes me. I'm willing to Skype with her and save up to visit her. I haven't told her that or the fact that I like her. I don't know what to do...

15190,Non-Romantic,2aordv,"So I've lived comfortably, asking permission to do anything or go anywhere all the way up until I started dating my girlfriend. She was the first serious relationship I've ever had. We talked about living together, having kids, pets etc.

She's been very understanding about me living at home which is amazing because she is already living on her own (and has been for quite some time). But I know that my parents saying that I can only sleep over at her place on days when I don't have work the next morning is taking a toll on her.

My parents are using the logic that I'll be too tired for work the next day and should come home and sleep before 12 so I can get ready. The flaw in that logic is that I am literally parking my car directly across the street from my girlfriend's place to get to work (20 mins away from my house). They said that having sex the night before will make me not perform at work. 

On top of that, I told them I don't feel like I've grown up enough and that I want to take on all the responsibility I can (continue paying car insurance and gas, take out my own phone bill, simulate rent every month by moving $1000 into my savings monthly). I told them I know I've been too lazy in the past and I'm committing myself to fixing it. They accepted that they sheltered me too much because my dad had a rough childhood and he didn't want the same for me. 

I love the relationship that I have with them and do not want to lose that bond with them (especially my dad. We're best friends) but I would also like to be able to go spend the night with my girlfriend during the week without walking home to a shitstorm of how disappointed they are. I tried to tell them that my GF respects that I need sleep and I get enough. She also fixes breakfast and makes sure I leave for work on time. They say I won't be able to perform.

They also seem to think she's instigating all the thoughts I now have on growing up and moving out. She did make me consider it but that's because I love her and want to be with her. She's fine with waiting for me to move out but this school night curfew shit is making her feel like she's dating a high schooler. She's not even allowed to spend the night at my place. When we're at my place, I can't even go to a closed room door because it sets a bad example for my little sister who might I add is 20. 

What can I do to make them accept that I'm an adult?

**EDIT:** I should probably add that they approach the topic of me moving out with shaming, negativity and guilt. Usually I'd hear you'd be a fool to move out now, Do you not care about your family anymore?, If you eave, don't expect us to chum up to you etc. Basically, they've made it seem that if I leave, they'll disown me.

We also live with his mom [60F] - the 3 of us rent a house, me and my SO live on one floor and his mom lives on the other. Before I met my SO, his mom had some really unhealthy habits, got really sick and had to have surgery which left her unable to do some stuff, like lift even slightly heavy things. 

My SO is extremely lazy. I love him to pieces in almost every other way, but, he has never once done the dishes since we've been together. I do *all* the cooking and cleaning for both of us, which is kind of a pain, but if I didn't do it, there would be flies everywhere. It doesn't bother me a ton, though.

What *does* bother me, is when my SO's mom asks him to do something for her around the house that she can't do herself (which happens pretty frequently), and he procrastinates and tries to get me to do it instead. Maybe this makes me a dick, but I usually refuse just on principle. I don't mind cleaning up after my SO, but when we started living together, I wasn't intending to be cleaning up after his mom, too. I just don't really think it's my responsibility, and if the roles were reversed, I wouldn't expect him to do *my* mom's housework. He always gets mad and huffy when I say no, but he literally does *no* housework of his own, he comes home from work and drinks beer and watches TV all night until he falls asleep... he has plenty of time.

15204,Non-Romantic,34xp4y,"I have been with my fiancé for about a year now. We had a pretty quick and messy start as I was in a relationship when we met and the break up was not amicable but that's not the issue. 

My fiancé has been friends with this girl for about a decade. She's the type of girl that takes 2 hours to get ready, make up, jewelry, fancy clothes, always looking like she's going to a cocktail party at a rich guys house. Gives everyone around her orders, and expects the men in her life to take care of her. She and my fiancé dated for an extremely brief period a few years ago but realized they were better as friends and that was that. 

Now none of that really bothers me bc I'm a pretty strong willed person and it takes a lot to get me heated or even upset. I tried to be cool with this chick when I first met her bc she was an important part of my fiancé's life (he thought of her as his best friend) and I wanted both of them to know that I respect their friendship and have no issues with them remaining close. 

She was not having any of that. She iced me out almost immediately and actively tried to get him to not be with me. She says that's bc of the way our relationship began and that she's just looking out for her friend, and if that were the case I would understand completely. But my gut tells me that's not it. 

For the past few years, my fiancé has been footing all the bills. The mortgage (he owns the house she lives in while he stays at my place that I rent bc I can't stand to be around her and refuse to put myself around all that catty negative energy), more than half the utiluties, the cell phone, she was even on his car insurance until about a month ago. I suspect this is the reason she doesn't like me, bc now that he is in a relationship he will no longer be financing her lifestyle. 

My main issue is this: back in February my fiancé asked her to move out bc he and I wanted to move in together. It took her almost 3 months to find a place but she finally did and as far as we can see her stuff is gone with the exception of a few random stacks of papers and some of her boyfriend's stuff in the garage. I have had to do a deep clean since she left. She has cats and dogs and I'm super allergic, so I prefer to do all the cleaning myself so I can be sure it's done right. I also have compulsive tendencies when it comes to cleaning so me doing it myself just saves me the headache of explaining my nature to others and keeps me from looking like to much of an unappreciative dick. 

Another problem is, she left her dog behind bc it needs to be rehomed (her bf has a small child and the dog is yippy and bites) and she hasn't found anyone to take him. And she is insisting she needs to be there for a few hours when I want to be ther(so I can move my stuff, continue to clean, and organize)to take care of the dog, finish moving, and clean. 

We tried negotiating a time for her to be done and she flat out refused saying she has other things to do and won't rearrange her schedule for us. My fiancé tried to tell her I insist on taking care of the cleaning myself and I will even take her dog out and feed and water him. She flipped out saying we were pushing her out and she told us she didn't have a lot of time off to do things and be isn't listening to her when she tells him things. 

I'm annoyed and pissed right now. I can move my entire apartment in one day and she needs several to move one room? Also, she had since February to get this done so I feel like at this point she can suck a dick and work around my schedule since she's been holding us up for almost 3 months... My fiancé has had enough. He said he doesn't give a shit if I make her uncomfortable it's my place now and if she doesn't want to be there when I am she can leave. I just hate drama and would rather not walk into a huge minefield of it. I'm hyper motivated to get things done so I need some advice on how to deal with her if she's there when I show up or if she shows up while I'm there. I'm very much a kill them with kindness person, but the struggle is real with this one.

Just a sidenote, there is no official lease and no written tenant/landlord agreement.

This causes her to find any reason to scold me and let out her frustrations on to me. She's never been there for me emotionally and I'm only relying on her because I'm financially dependent on her.**

So my mom and dad never really liked each other and up until today, I don't understand why they ever together. When I lived with my parents and sister (I'm the oldest), my mom never used to scold me because my dad used to call her out for it. Then I just started feeling like my mother just despised me.


1. When he moved out, I started sensing the fact that my mom favored my sister over me. She always told me, You act just like your father and I hate that, or Get out of my face, I don't want to see you, and proceeded to tell me to lock myself in the bathroom with the lights off for 30 minutes until she was ready to see my face again. She always said (and still does), If I had the chance to redo my life, I would've married a white man so my kids could have curly hair and blue eyes. (I'm African)


2. About the African thing. We lived in Africa nine years ago. My room was made out of cardboard, it was hard for my mother to find water and electricity, and a bunch of vigilantes killed a lot of my relatives. When we moved to America, my mother banned my sister and I from speaking swahili or talking about anything related to Africa (Except our relatives). The other day I was talking about how I admire Akon for providing electricity to millions of Africans and she starts yelling at me saying that she feels like I'm looking backwards, why am I not focusing on things that are going on in America? Why am I reading Al Jazeera anyway? and if Akon is so admirable, then how come she didn't get a mother's day gift for mother's day (it was finals week, I had no money--she always tells us not to buy her things and we never bought her anything but this year was such a big deal, and I sent her an email telling her happy mothers day). That was two weeks ago. So yesterday I go to the mall and buy her lotion from BBW (keep in mind that my job doesn't pay much, it's $9 for 3 hour shifts 4 days a week). Today she tells my sister that she didn't want the lotion and that she wanted Panda Express. I'm so done. Then that evening she asked me, Can you explain to me what you do in this house that makes you valuable? That makes people appreciate to see you? I just said nothing because she already had an answer for me in mind.




3. I'm 5'7 which I guess is considered tall for people in my family. My sister (14F) is 5'2 or 5'3 My mom always gushes about how my sister is so beautiful, how she loves that my sister is so short, and how she wishes that she was short like my sister.

 My sister gets to take acrobatics classes, ballet, and gymnastics, but when I had asked my mom for singing lessons (Aged 12), she said no. This stuff isn't really a big deal to me, but I just noticed it.

4. Now we get to the emotionally abusive stuff. When I was 15, I was hoping my mom would provide me with some sort of comfort when I decided to tell her about how depressed I was. Instead, she sat across from me unaffected. She didn't even offer to give me a hug or provide any practical advice. That was the last time I told her about my depression. My suicidal tendencies and depressive thoughts began the year before (When I was 14). She thinks that if you think happy thoughts, then you won't be sad anymore. 

5. When I forget to wash a plate in the sink or wipe the counter, she uses that as an excuse to insult my intelligence e.g. Why do you act so stupid? For forgetting to do regular household chores, I get 5 hours of yelling followed by a grudge that surmises when I do something else that aggravates her. When everyone else pisses her off at work, I'll forget to do something and then she'll just go off on me. She always says, I can't have a good relationship with you because I'm already mad at you before you even show me your face, and I'm trying to teach you not to be a nuisance to other people, if I don't teach you, then people won't like you.

She's just raised me to think that I'm not and will never be good enough in every aspect of life. I've always strived to be perfect: get good grades, go to the gym, be nice and there for others, etc...but I've never really felt good enough because my mother treats me like I'm the bane of her existence. She's always just nitpicked every single thing that I've done and used it to her advantage to put me down. I just finished my freshman year (lived on campus) and I enjoyed being by myself. She says that she doesn't have enough money to let me live on campus next year (lies) so I have to stay home. I'm already so depressed this summer and I can't stomach living with her during the school year.

15223,Non-Romantic,2p9pkr,"My mom never has anything to say other than lectures on how to do simple things. She demands attention from me all the time and continues to treat me like I'm 10. Every time we fight, it's the same fight all the time. It's either because I don't want to talk or because she pushed me over the edge with her constant badgering. I've told her repeatedly that I don't want to talk about certain things and she continues to ask about them on a daily basis. 

For an example, if I got a cut, she will ask about it day and night. I will tell her I do not want to talk about it, and she will continue to ask nonstop. I always tell you the things I don't want to talk about, and she will continue to talk about them. I know this is her caring, but it's not really caring when you keep asking about something someone has already said they don't want to talk about. Maybe if she asked me once in a while, I would be okay with that. But at this point, I just stay silent and ignore everything. When I achieve anything, she doesn't really care.

 For an example... i just got a 2k scholarship...something that should be good news. She said, see, anyone can do it!.............          When I told her i was dating my first girlfriend when i was 20, she freaked out.... Now she constantly says.. well go to [GF]'s house if you etc 
My mom thinks I cannot function without her. honestly, she will always says that she'll never make breakfast,etc for me when she is mad.. but she clearly knows I've been making my own food for years. 

My mom and my sister are tight. My sister never understands my problems because she submits herself to my mom in every way. she thinks I'm spoiled when in reality, i'm frugal and barely spend money. How can i be spoiled when she spends thousands of dollars on a wedding? She thinks that all the conflict between my mom and I is caused by me alone. Her justification is that mom cares.... but my mom never really cares beyond herself because she never takes my opinion into consideration. How is this caring if it's one-sided? My sister thinks she is always right. Once, she joked that my girlfriend had X feature and I told her I found it offensive. she couldn't understand but her fiancee told her he was on the same page as me. She was offensive for saying that remark....  My sister has had big birthday parties and she goes out to eat often. She had a great life, achieving high marks in highschool, getting scholarships in college, getting a job early on. But she thinks the bullying I've dealt with weren't a big deal in my k-12 education.... 

My mom and sister think I treat my girlfriend better than them. Of course, why wouldn't I treat someone who takes my opinion into consideration better?!

15239,Non-Romantic,2fzpg9,"I've been dating my boyfriend, who I will refer to as Josh, for 2 years in a week and during this time he has had depression. It was pretty severe, the therapist he saw diagnosed him with PTSD, anxiety and depression so he can have pretty awful panic attacks, generally become really worked up/emotional very quickly. I have learnt over the two years how to deal with it because things that seem like him being careless or thoughtless are usually just a byproduct of his crazy attempts to not hate himself or do the right thing. He is on an anti-depressant and regularly smokes weed. Now, I know lots of people will critasize this choice, I did too, but he genuinly seems happier and better. He has less emotional outbursts, seems much more comfy in his own skin and was settling into a really nice thing. He has a job now, managed to get his licence and is looking into courses to do next year.



His brother, lets call him Sam, lives with Josh in their mums house. He is just now finishing his uni degree. He had been living by himself a few years back I think but now he's back at home. He isn't really straight edged, he has done drugs and I know he is pretty dismissive of Josh's smoking (a close friend who is friends with him said Josh was acting immature because smoking weed is for 16 year olds). An example of Sam's drug taking is his friends doing lines of coke on the pool table in Josh's room while their mum is upstairs. Josh and Sam used to be really close when they were kids, and I know Josh really misses Sam being there for him. Sam basically stopped talking to Josh since he turned 14/15 and only really talks to him if he wants something or wants to criticize him. This really hurts Josh because he looks up to Sam and I know he thinks a lot of his brother. I personally have always thought he was a jerk, but that's just my opinion. Anyway, this is just backstory. 



The problem arose yesterday when Josh and a few of his friends were setting up to smoke in the backyard of Josh/Sams house. This is pretty regular for them. Josh goes inside to grab some water and Sam starts ripping him a new one about weed fucking up his brain and not to do drugs at home. Josh yells at him back, but he does agree to leave the house. We all leave, I go home because I have stuff to do but I facebook Josh encouraging him to talk to his brother about it and talk it out.



Now, Josh hasn't told me exactly what Sam said back to him, but it went along the lines of Sam thinks Josh is too dependent on artificial substances to make himself feel okay and he should be focusing on self improvement instead. I think he was pretty harsh about it, Sams not exactly a nice and fuzzy guy. Josh is now a complete wreck, he doesn't want to make his brother mad so he is thinking of stopping the anti-depressants and smoking. I don't think he should, we have been really happy lately and everything has seemed aces. 




I am furious that his brother managed to fuck up the good vibes Josh was having, especially because he basically has no involvement in Josh's life other than making it worse. Last year he was on Josh's case about having a job and not doing well in uni, which was really unhelpful because it made Josh freak out even more. I agree we should be more discreet, but Sam hasn't even asked why Josh is depressed, let alone why he makes the choices he makes. He didn't say a thing to Josh about this stuff until he had this huge outburst and I think there are better ways to deal with these issues. But I don't know if its my place to say anything because Sam honestly scares me and I don't want to make things worse. I think he is hypocritical about drugs and, as an older sibling myself, I think he is a disgrace of a brother. My little sister has depression and I would never say or do anything that makes them critically upset. Josh is the youngest of the four full brothers and third youngest in the step-brother/full brother chain. 



I want to tell Sam that he has no right to pressure Josh with the moral high ground, especially considering he has never shown any interest in Josh's well-being. Should I?

However, there is this one patron who has been carrying a flame for me.  Over the course of my 3+ years at the library he has:

* After the note incident he approached me a week later and asked me what I thought of it.  I told him while it was nice of him (I think that was a mistake on my part), I was not interested and I was seeing someone.  He asked if I wanted to get coffee with him sometime and I told him no, I was/am seeing someone.  He asked if I was sure, I said yes.

* He occasionally writes short stories and would have me read them.

* About a month ago he gave me one of those melted plastic bead things in some kind of design, I threw it away.

* This morning I got a delivery of flowers addressed to me.  I signed for them because I thought they were from who I am *actually* dating.  There was a note included and through some basic sleuthing I figured out it was this patron.

15278,Non-Romantic,2idklh,"   I keep awkwardly bumping into a friend who I just reconciled with after a little issue. Basically a few months ago I asked her out, she said yes but it was finals and when she asked when I said since we're busy that it would be next semester. Afterwards she said that she wasn't looking for anything serious and I said that I understood. Which was my intention as 
I didn't expect anything out of this either. 

   Then next semester starts and after a few weeks I texted her asking how her summer went and she said it went well. Then I asked her if she was free for lunch and I got no response. Thinking back on it I don't think I made my intentions clear. So I texted her saying that I was sorry and that I misread what she told me last semester, that I only intended for it to be an outing as just friends and that I think I gave the wrong impression. I told her that I didn't want to lose her as a friend and that I hope the message clears things up.

    She replies back saying that she was sorry for not replying and she didn't want to come off as being rude or ignore my text, it was just that she didn't know how to say that she just wanted to be friends without saying it in a hurtful way. She said that this created anxiety for her because it happened before in the past and she thought I was expecting more from her when I asked her out. Then she said that she appreciated that I reach out and that of course we would remain friends.

    Then about a month after that I actually bumped into her on campus and we had a brief chat and that was it. I was relieved that things were back to normal for the most part. Then two days later it I feel that it just went bad all in one day. Last Friday I bumped into her again while on my way to a meeting and we had a brief chat again but it felt a little awkward. Then on the same day the worst happened, I bumped into her again at her apartment.  Her place just happens to be on the first floor right near the entrance and I moved in a few months ago after leaving my RA job because it’s the closest to the school and you don’t pay utilities. It looked like she was moving stuff into her place and when I passed by she said, ”Hey “my name” ad instead of being nonchalant and just saying hi back I said,” Hey, I forgot to tell you I moved in here.” *sigh* Immediately after I realized how wrong that came out because she already knew that I knew she stayed in that apartment complex and now it seems like I’m creeping on her because I moved there and kept bumping into her. What’s worse is that I think that is what she thinks because not even two minutes later when I get into room I saw that she posted an ambiguous message on twitter saying “OMFG THIS WOULD ****ING HAPPEN TO ME. WHAT DA ****.”  
   
    This could just be a coincidence though but Ugh now I feel like crap because I keep giving the wrong impression. I don’t want to be seen as some creepy guy who can’t get the message but I just keep having these awkward encounters. I’m even thinking of changing my walking route just to avoid encounters because just when it seemed liked I patched things up I kept bumping into her which is hurting the cool down period. Anyway I just wanted to rant and now I’ll see how things go from here. Sorry for the length but I wanted it to be clear from the start till now.

I wore my first button down (a sheer chiffon one) to work today and received compliments on it from both my parents. My dad insisted that he'd always told me to buy them because he found the style beautiful and elegant. My mom asked why he never told her that, there was an awkward pause, I began to say you already do wear button downs, but was cut off by my dad saying you need to lose ten inches before you can look like that and gesturing at me.

In fairness, that's true but also incredibly blunt (plus, I'm *22*) It was also right in front of me and my 16F sister (who struggles with her weight). My mom was humiliated and stammered some arguments, among them ten inches... That's ridiculous. That would be 24 inches, is anyone 24 inches? My dad argued back that he only responded because she asked. Mom said Not even models are that thin. Dad then said Oh yeah? Let's bring out the tape measure and compare you and hopeyoufind.

Mom's not skinny, but she isn't absurdly fat or anything. Maybe 150-160 and wears it well, especially for having had two kids and a career as a bio PhD. She's been going to the gym daily for at least the last five years and while the weight probably will never come off she can run a half marathon and is in better health the any of us. My dad is in terrible health because he won't exercise but stays skinny-fat.

She tells me that because I'm a [last name] I will always have financial security and she won't. Every single time I've reassured her that as long as I am afloat she is. However, that doesn't stop the broken record. Every conversation with her has been about the intricacies of their failing marriage, details I wish I didn't know. I have not had a single conversation with her in months that doesn't come back to my father and how much of a victim my mother feels that she is.

A secondary problem I've had with her is, in her musings about the party, she refused to invite any men. 
I know that this is sometimes traditional, but MIL is also aware that this would break my Dad's heart (as this is the only grandchild he is ever going to have). The no men would also mean my SO couldn't be there... which neither of us agree with.
She also wanted to include the link to my Baby Registry in the invites. I find this incredibly tacky and would be embarrassed for my friends and family to receive an invite with such a forceful prod to bring a gift.

As of right now, she expects me to plan her 2 wedding showers, one of which is far off in another state with the groom's family (I've no idea how I'm going to go about that), she also wants me to plan an engagement party, the rehearsal dinner, and a bachelorette party/spa day for all the bridesmaids, along with a dress hunt for her wedding dress and all of the bridesmaids dresses. She has put me in charge of buying and making decorations for all the parties and wedding itself, setting up their wedding registry for engagement gifts, creating and sending out invitations, making any and all reservations regarding the wedding, setting up and cleaning up the parties and wedding, hiring a photographer and getting them a cake and choosing a caterer for the wedding. I am expected to pay for her expenses along with mine in regards to the spa treatment (which in and of itself would cost me around 200 dollars, depending on the prices of the place she has picked out) and I'm also expected to buy her other bridal gifts, such as a tiara. She wants me to pay for her manicure, pedicure and hair treatment for the day of the wedding. I'm also expected to fund all the parties involved with the wedding.

I feel absolutely overwhelmed by all of the things that she is telling me that I have to plan and pay for on my own. I'm in the process of looking for a job, so I don't know where all of this money for her wedding could even come from. I've tried to explain to her that money is tight for me and I don't know how much I could pay for other than the basic things like my dress, but she won't listen to me. I've tried to explain to her that I'm happy to help, but I can't do all of this completely on my own...she just will not listen. And if you're wondering why her parents aren't involved? Her mother is leaving for a month or two on a trip, so she won't even be here to help with anything...her father is always busy with work...but her parents have never been very involved in her life, sadly. 

She has scheduled this wedding for only a few months away, despite me trying to tell her that holding off for a little while may give us more time to get everything done like she wants it, but she doesn't want to listen to me. I feel so guilty because I feel like I'm being a bad friend to her by being unable to do things like she wants it, but there's just no way that I can take care of all of this on my own. 

What do you think I should do? I'm afraid of creating conflict with her because she has a habit of dropping friends when she has any sort of conflict with them...even if the friend tries to work it out with her, she can be stubborn about it. I don't want to lose her as a friend, especially now that she has a wedding coming up, but I just feel at a loss of what to do. 


**tl;dr** My friend is getting married and chose me for her maid of honor. I'm happy for her, but she expects me to completely plan and pay for everything involved with the wedding. Despite me trying to talk to her about it, she won't listen. I don't want to lose her as a friend. How do you think I should handle this?

Wow, I come back from my night class and find that my post has exploded with comments! Thank you all for the advice and for understanding my predicament, I will just have to be firm and explain to her that I can't pay for and plan everything all on my own. I will be checking out the links that people have provided, and use them to back up my side of the conversation.
A lot of people have been asking me why I would want this friend to stick around, since it seems like she hasn't been acting like a good friend. Well, she has pulled through for me in the past when I've had serious things happen in my life. I felt like I could talk to her about anything and she'd be supportive of me.
Although, to be honest, she has always had a bit of a self-centered streak...like last Halloween for example, we each made our own costumes and she didn't seem to like it when I got compliments on mine, as if she felt like I was taking the spotlight from her or something...but I just figured that everyone has their things about them that aren't perfect. I never thought that things would turn out like this when she got engaged!
Also, I'm very shy and reserved, so other than my boyfriend and my family...I don't exactly have tons of friends.

6 years ago my friend Zombie died in a car accident 3 months before high school ended. Today, about an hour ago, I turned a corner and actually bumped into him. I know it was him.

He had heterochromia so his left eye was brown and his right eye was blue and his right eye had a torn iris that made it look like a U. Another identifying feature was the pigment on his upper-left cheek was always really pale no matter how much sun he got.

It was definitely him who I bumped into. I just stared and said his name Zombie? and he looked...surprised? Startled? Anyways he hurried past me. I called after him but he just kept speeding away from me. I didn't know how to react so I just stood there watching and processing what just happened.

We lived on the East coast, and I am on the West coast right now.

We were really close friends, and I still keep in touch with his family back home. Our high school friends mostly keep up with each other and I'm sure they'd all be, well, devastated if they found out. At most they'd be massively confused. I can't even imagine what his family would do.

I'm not sure what to think of this.

15362,Non-Romantic,2smw12,"I love my roommate she is awesome. We hang out have similar interests, but I am SO tired of her son. I've never felt like this towards a kid. 

I have a 1(16months) year old little girl. She is very big and advanced for her age and is already a little taller and bigger than him (she wears a 3T). She can talk in small phrases and understand very well. 

My roommate's son is constantly crying about something. He screams and cries constantly. They leave at 6:30am every morning and he almost always wakes my daughter(and myself) up screaming. He is constantly whining and crying when he wants something(which I know can be a normal 3 year old thing). These are all things I could deal with what really pisses me off is how he acts towards my daughter. He pinches, pushes, and spits on her constantly. She touches and toy that's his(our hers for that matter) he screams that it's his and will throw it at her or hit her in the head with it. He will follow her around the house and wait until no one is watching and push her into a wall or something. He pushed her off the little trampoline they got for Christmas this morning right after his mom thanked him for sharing so well. 

I'm so over this and his mom just says oh I'm sorry he's just having a bad day or I said I'd never let him act like this but daycare had destroyed my living little boy or you'll see one day it sucks not having control of your child. She hardly ever scolds him no time out no spanking nothing. He will hit and spit on her.

I'm at my wits end cause there are sometimes when he hits he really hard or bits her and won't let go that I want to knock the shit out of him. I'm not saying my daughter is a saint she will OCCASIONALLY try to hit him or take a toy away but I will pop her hand tell her no put her in her crib for two mins. She recently bit me and I popped her mouth she hasn't bit me since. I try to be respectful when they're asleep if she's being loud I take her into my room to play. I tell her no to be nice and take her hand and rub my arm gently when she tries to hit him to show her what nice touching is.

She is getting to the point where she cries and runs to me when she sees him. It usually isn't a problem because she works at 7am so they leave before we're awake and asleep when I get home from work at 9pm and I leave before she gets home from work but lately she got a promotion so her hours are changing and we've been crossing paths a lot.

I don't know what to do out what to say to get because I k* now people get super defensive of their children and I do have to live with her. 

Tl;Dr ... My roommate's three year old is constantly pinching, biting, pushing, and spitting on my one year old daughter. It's getting so bad she runs from him crying and afraid now. His mom won't discipline her. What do I do?!?! :(

15381,Non-Romantic,34hkl5,"Backstory: Me and my SO have been together for two years. We are currently expecting our first child. For the entirety of our relationship, he has worked pretty far away and has leased an apartment in the town he works. I work in our hometown and live with back with my parents because 1) I'm in school and 2) they live walking distance from my job. I don't want to pay $600-$800 dollars a month to live farther away from my work. Friday-Sunday, we both spend a lot of time at my SO's parents guest house. The guest house is a few houses down the street from their actual house, and his grandmother lives a few houses down from there. We pay a small amount of rent plus electric and water on the guest house. Me and my SO recently bought our own house between his and my work, but we won't be in it until AFTER the baby is born. Its imperative we are able to stay in the rent house with baby for a few weeks/months before we get into our actual house. 

About 3-4 months ago, myself, my SO, and our friends Josh and Grant were all hanging out at the guest house. Josh is my SO's BEST friend and more like his brother. He will be my childs uncle. We love Josh and have never, ever had an issue with Josh! My SO's parents have known Josh since he could walk. 

My SO's parents are ultra conservative, in an odd way. They think drinking and alcohol is terrible, and loudly let us know, but they drink regularly. They have a very high moral standard for others around them to uphold, but don't seem to uphold it in their own lives, but will very vocally let you know if they think you are doing something you shouldn't. His mother, especially, is pretty pushy and opinionated. All I've heard is how its a shame me and SO are having a baby before we got married and we should have thought about that. Frankly, I don't care. It happened, we are committed, and marriage will come when it comes. 

Anyway, when we were all hanging out at the guest house, ALL the doors were open, it was the middle of the day (around noon) and the house lights were all on. Josh walked into our bedroom and laid on the bed, and my SO walked in and sat on the floor beside the bed. Grant claimed the recliner, and I sat on the other side of the QUEEN sized bed next to Josh. We sat and talked and had some beers (or they did!) and one by one, we all sort of passed out. Josh was under the comforter turned toward the wall and I was on top of the comforter with a small throw turned toward my boyfriend on the floor. A good 2-3 foot of space was between me and Josh. We were not touching nor facing each other. We were back to back. Nothing happened. 

My SO's grandmother came over at some point and walked into the house. She didn't have to knock or open doors because they were all open. We woke up, and drowsily talked to her a bit. All was great and she left. I then shut the doors, turned out the lights, grabbed a bigger blanket for myseld and SO and gave him a pillow and finished the nap on the floor by my SO. 

This was probably 2-3 months ago.

We had a doctors appointment today, so SO took off work and came home yesterday. When I pulled into the drive, he and his parents were all standing around arguing. It was obvious that his mother was furious - yelling and pointing fingers and his dad was backing her up. My SO was throwing his hands in the air, shaking his head and walking away. I get out of the vehicle and his parents start walking back toward their house. Which was odd because they ALWAYS have talked to me. I'd say we are close. 

I asked my SO what was going on and he informed me that his grandmother had told his mother that when she came to the guest house all those months ago that something weird was going on between me, SO and Josh and that me and Josh were in bed together in an inappropriate way. SO mom and dad now think that my SO allows his best friend to have sex with me, and that we have a threesome type relationship going on - which is FAR from the truth. They said they beleive it, because they walked outside the other day and Josh had his hands on my stomach.... he was feeling my daughter move!!!!! They know I'm pregnant so I'm not sure why they are twisting this. They told us that Josh is no longer allowed on their property and that we will follow their strict rules from now on in the guest house, which includes no friends over, no drinking, no coming in past midnight, among other things. They also said if Josh is on their property, they will call the police. 

My SO has attempted to talk to them several times and his mom absolutely flips out - yelling, accusing and just acting holier-than-thou. 

We can't really talk to his grandma because 1) she is convinced of what she saw 2) Shes crazy. I just don't think it would do anything productive. 

My SO isn't home a lot, so I've decided to talk to his parents... I feel like since this accusation is about me, I can do that. It offends me that they would think such a thing about me... but the thing is, I'm 23 years old and not their daughter. If I wanted to have that type of relationship with their son and Josh it is totally none of their business - but regardless, I am going to talk to them and try to clear things up.

I have no idea where to start or what to say. I've seen so many great, clear cut, precise conversations on here and I need something like that! 

We love his parents and don't want to cut them out - we appreciate them letting us live in the guest house until we can move into our own home (which we have already purchased.) But we can't live under their thumb. We are our own family and adults... I'm not going to have a curfew and have no friends over, especially since we pay for the place. 

Any ideas, reddit? Not even sure where to BEGIN this conversation.

My grandmother likes to come over at random times of the week uninvited and unannounced, mostly for the purpose of lecturing my brother. My brother is dealing with an undiagnosed sickness (doctors are still trying to figure out what it is) and what at times seems to be depression. He's been having problems with dizziness, sleeping, and appetite. Most of the time he finds it best to lay down and nap, so we let him.

My grandmother's opinion is that all of his problems are in his head, so she'll just come over and interrupt his naps to tell him that. She'll lecture him on how he needs to be more selfless and that he needs to make more friends, and then she'll drag him downstairs to play the piano for her because that's something he's really good at. My brother is too nice to say no. 

I've asked my father to tell her to stop coming over in this way. If she could warn us first, even that would be better. She just comes in with a spare key.

Background information: 


I work in the custodial department at my University. There are different buildings that students work in that each have different full-time workers that help the students out. Then there is my boss who supervises and hires all the people for the buildings. 


Anyway, when I was first hired I was working at the library. Then last Fall my boss offered me a position in another building where I would be paid more and would be a student manager. I thought this was going to be a great opportunity and accepted the offer. Also, my SO was already working in the building I was transferring too.


To keep a very long story short, there was a lot of issues with full-time worker, let's call her Carrie, at this building. It was bearable in the beginning but then part-way through the semester my boss had to go medical and that's when things just spiraled down.  Once my boss was off, there was no one else willing to keep Carrie under control. 


She began harassing my co-workers more and more. Then she got other student workers from other departments in our building to harass them as well. I did not really experience too much of the harassment because she liked me oddly enough, yet she put me in an awkward position because she would come up to me and say racist things about the international workers and would also make really sexist remarks about the male workers. Basically, if you were an international student and/or male , she'd target you more. 


My SO is not someone to sit back and take stuff like that, so he complained a couple times to other full-time workers and some higher-ups, but, in the end, nothing was done. Ultimately the stress of it all got so bad for me that I just up and quit while my SO put in his two weeks. Yet, when I quit, Carrie started telling everyone that my SO was beating me and verbally abusing me (not true at all by the way)  which caused him to quit his two-week notice early. 


The following semester my boss is back and she offers both my SO and I, jobs at different locations. I take a job, but my SO was not in the position to take the job she offered at the time. 



Today: 


Now with the start of this semester my SO is looking for a job and e-mails my boss about the position she offered him last semester. She had not gotten back to him, so when she called I just casually asked if the position was stile available. That's when she told me she had not responded to my SO because she did not want to give him the job because he quit without warning with the last job. 


This probably would not bother me so much if she had not offered the job to him last semester. We both knew when we quit like that that we most likely would be burning bridges and neither of us expected to get more job offers from her after that.


I also just have this unsettling feeling that she had listened to the lies that Carrie had been telling and that she has only kept me on and given me so many job opportunities because she sees me as a victim. She never got to her my side or my SOs side of the story even though we both offered to speak with her in person about why we quiet so suddenly when she had returned. 


Anyway, I am considering looking for a new job now, but I cannot help but wonder if I am overreacting?

We got on very well and had a lot in common which is hard for me to find.

It took a lot of effort to see her as she was frequently busy but when I did see her it made me insanely happy. We kind of kept our friendship between us though as we knew the age gap would be frowned upon. After a hangout session I foolishly kissed her, she reciprocated though. Was all sweet, felt happy as fuck despite age gap, we both agree we should wait before we tell anyone.

a rumour then spreads at work that 'I took advantage of her when she was drunk and had sex with her', something I wouldn't do because I am not THAT big of an asshole and despite the romantic relationship I still kind of had an older brother role over her (let's not analyse that though).

I am at this point unaware and ask her as normal to hang out, for about a few weeks I get back nothing but rejections but okay, I know she is busy. She basically has no days off so I take this with a grain of salt, but then a month roles by and I have not seen her (still unaware of the rumour) so I get annoyed, not angry but I kind of got frustrated. This may just be me trying to justify it but I think I had reason to be annoyed because literally all I saw was a friend who didn't want to hang out with me, she called off our relationship as well without giving me a reason, just 'it won't work'.

Okay I am pretty pissed but we get past it until one day she stops talking to me completely, freak out thinking she is in trouble or not doing okay. This is the moment I find out about said rumour and lose my shit at the people spreading it, I try to tell her I had no knowledge of it and had no part in spreading it, occurs to me how awful I was to her. Try to explain this to no avail, she responds (finally) with such a heart wrenching message telling me in essence 'because of me she will never trust another person'. I know she is being hyperbolic but still hurt to read.

At this point I freaked the fuck out because I not only lost a girlfriend but someone I loved as a friend and I admit I got way weird, obviously doing more harm then good by sending message after message asking her to forgive me, skip to today -  think to myself 'nah I am over her', still see her at work sometimes and everything just comes flooding back, all I want is for her to forgive me but I cannot talk to her because I fear making it worse, I already got near stalky and do not want that to happen again.

Cathy has a strong affinity for my own country and loves our music, literature, TV everything. We met via mutual friends and have quickly become strong friends. There are romantic tinges here in that we have kissed before but nothing sexual at all.

She is currently spending a 2 month vacation in my country of origin and has been enjoying her time a lot. Recently she went to stay with my parents as they live in a fairly famous rural and rugged location which she has always wanted to visit, parents know we aren't dating but are just super hospitable to all of my friends.

The problem is her mother. Her mother is a super hardcore Christian and is obsessed with the purity of her daughter. Cathy is a Christian as well but fairly liberal in her outlook, her mother demands photos of her being in church every weekend and had a fair sized freakout when she went to stay with my parents but calmed down when she found out how sweet my parents were to her as a guest (which is a big deal in this culture).

The problems seem to be mounting when Cathy returns however, her mother is becoming more and more obsessed with virginity and more Narcissistic in outlook regarding it (along the lines of if she lost it, her mother would be devastated and could never live it down that Cathy’s body isn’t something she can choose what to do with, her mum gave it to her so she gets to say what it does, Cathy has put it as a disorder) even though we live in a fairly liberal capital city.

Cathy is concerned that if she returns her mum will put her on 24/7 observation (Cathy lives with her sister in an apartment owned by her parents, Sis would inform on her activities and moving out isn’t an option, it’s a capital city, it’s expensive) and her mother’s own vitriol is ramping up just as Cathy's own taste of freedom in my own country grows.

Cathy is becoming increasingly pessimistic about her mother and has commented that she wishes we could let each other go so her mum would let her live her life. I want her to not have this burden but I also know I want to continue our relationship as I do care for her and we do get along very well. I used to be the sort of person who would always try to 'save the girl' but now realize that this is dumb, in these scenarios people save themselves, though I do not mean they do this without support.

It'd never been an issue before but he's been doing something that honestly bothers me for a while now. I know it's stupid and the solution is to speak up but... it's creepy as heck and is this even a common thing people do?

Anyway! Cookie and I both have a girlfriend and a boyfriend, respectively. He had been single for a while before meeting his current girlfriend, and he was immediately ecstatic. They have been together for two years now and this has never changed. His mood and self-esteem have improved greatly and honestly, it's fantastic. I'm so happy and whenever they have problems, or there's something cute he'd like to share, he tells me. At the same time, when it pops up in conversation, I share something about my boyfriend and me as well. It's nice to support each other and tell funny stories.

However, ever since they started doing foreplay and slowly getting ready for sex, that's all I hear from him. I wouldn't mind it if it was asking for advice, or sharing advice, or if there was any reason whatsoever behind it. Other friends do it as well, like if we have to hang out and they're late they'll make a perverted joke and wink at each other. My boyfriend and I do it as well. It's funny every once in a while.

But Cookie, he now starts conversation with all the positions they did the night before. If he came inside her, what she screamed, I can picture all the details. I even know all the types and sizes of condoms he's tried. It doesn't come up randomly in conversation either. There's no more conversation. He chats me up with some descriptive detail, and whatever I may say, he keeps describing more! Everything begins and ends like this. 

I don't mind talking about sex, but I don't want to have these images in my mind everytime! I just want my perverted friend with whom I could still have actual conversations back. I tried changing the topic, replying shortly, not replying, I tried asking if his girlfriend was cool with him telling me all these things too. He never got the hint so I guess the only option I have is to be straightforward and tell him that I'm happy but not interested. I just don't want to have a fight about this. I'm scared he will be super hurt because he's so keen on being with his girlfriend, really. I am the same about my boyfriend, though, and I don't go parading our kinky fun around. Do I keep hoping it'll die down or is it a matter of different boundaries? How is this even a thing? 

Maybe I should mention that before meeting his girlfriend, he confessed feelings for me. He may be trying to impress me as a friend, though, but nothing more. As far as I know, his girlfriend's the one and he's gotten over it.

My 18 year old sister has always had problems with my mother but recently it has reached a boiling point and she decided she wants to leave the house. It would be awesome if she did it the right way and got a job and roomed somewhere in the city (we live in Chicago) that would have been fine and dandy because she's 18 she can do whatever she wants. BUT she has found someone, an older man, online who lives in New Mexico who is offering her a place to stay for free.
    It sounds extremely, extremely suspicious because my sister is exactly the right kind of girl that weirdos and pimps look for, she is vulnerable, has no money, has low self esteem, and is looking for an escape.

I just graduated from college last month. I went to University that was out of state and spent 2 out of the 3 summers having internships or research opportunities in my college city (so I really haven't spent that much time at home).

My parents got divorced when I was a sophomore in college (2 years ago). It was an extremely fast divorce. They formally admitted they were having problems to me and my older brother in October and were legally divorced and my mom had moved out by December. Things have horrible between my parents ever since.

All this being said, my mom was the one to move out of my childhood house and into a townhouse about 40 minutes from my dad. I'm not on the best of terms with my dad due to a very long and complicated string of events involving a step family and verbal abuse and such so I chose to move back home into my mom's house until I find a permanent job. 

Before I moved back home we had a chat about boundaries and giving each other space as in the past we have tended to spend 24/7 with each other during christmas breaks and such and clearly that would be sustain in this type of situation. 

I was on board with this, but it seems the last week or so that every single thing I do gets on my mom's nerves. She hasn't come to me about being upset but she has told my older brother I need to Fix my fucking attitude and I know she is spending a lot more time running errands or at her boyfriends instead of at home. 

I have a part time job, I cook and clean for myself, do my own laundry, etc in order to have a minimal impact on her. I'm hurt that she doesn't feel comfortable coming to me about whatever is bothering her.

I understand she may feel pressure to balance work, her long term boyfriend, and me, but we've only had 2 or 3 dinners alone in the past month I've been home and a handful of lunches. 

I'm at a loss about how to make this transition easier for her when it's stressful for me as well. 

Very few of my friends came home after college and the ones that did live about an hour away. I'm lonely and I miss having my mom as a friend.

15466,Non-Romantic,2oahrr,"Well, this is really ridiculous/long and I'm freaking out a little bit. Thanks so much for any input or advice you might have for me!


I live with my boyfriend and two other people.  The other two, (David and Shannon), have been dating for about four months. David is very controlling and possessive, and I've been trying to convince Shannon to break up with him for months.  She moved David in at the beginning of the lease (which is in my name, as well as all the bills) telling me that he was only staying for a few days.  He's been here since August, and I pretty much decided to let it go because it saved me roughly 300 - 350 a month in bills.  

Unfortunately David is a horrible person.  Shannon is not allowed to have any male friends, she's not allowed to hang out with me and my boyfriend at our house, he reads all of her emails etc...  The list goes on and on.  Basically, if you can think of controlling or abusive behavior, he does it.   Two weeks ago,  Shannon asked me to hang onto her phone so he wouldn't be able to go through all of her emails.  I kept telling her she should break up with him,  but she always tells me that she loves him sooo much  so she can't do it.  I hang on to her phone, and I stick it in my panty drawer.

Yesterday afternoon, the sheriff came by with a warrant for my boyfriend for a probation violation (didn't complete community service hours).  I was at work at the time, and got a call from my friend who let me know about the situation.  I come home and David has all the doors to the rooms open, and is cleaning the house.  He's never cleaned any of the shared space in the house before, those chores have always fallen on me and my boyfriend.  Because of the situation, I didn't notice that many things were out of place.  I went over to a friend's house,  hung out, then came back to my house. 

When I got back home, Shannon came up to me and said that we needed to talk.  She then told me that she had found her phone in her room, and all the emails/fb messages had been marked as read.  She asked me if I had left it out.  I explained where I had left it, and said that I didn't want him living here anymore.  She then told me  Well, if he apologizes to me and to you and  **really, really** means it, it's okay right? 

At that point in the conversation, it was around one in the morning, and I was pretty intoxicated.  I was having some trouble processing what David had done and I told her Fine, whatever, we'll talk about this later.

Today, after getting home from work and finding out that boyfriend is going to be in jail today/possibly til next week, David came up to  me.  David said that the phone was on a shelf in my room, and that he's not a creep.  He said that he wouldn't do that, and I just need to chill out and quit lying.  

I don't know what to do in this situation.  I've been looking for  new roommates for a little while already due to other problems with David and Shannon, but every lead has fallen through.  I can't afford to pay rent on this house by myself, and since boyfriend is currently in jail, he obviously isn't able to help out.  I'm stuck in this lease til August 2015, and I can't stand David or Shannon.  I've moved my valuables out of the house, and I have somewhere else to sleep tonight, but if anyone can think of a LT solution, that would be amazing.

15478,Non-Romantic,2qdzvt,"I was raised predominantly by my mother and stepfather, and saw my dad on weekends. My mom and stepdad treated me horribly - without going into too much detail it is easy to say they were/are emotionally abusive and negligent - I (along with my two siblings 21F and 16M) was raised as less than our half-sister. I was repeatedly told my needs weren't valid (such as taking me to school, buying me basic clothing, bathing me as a small child, etc.) and that I was worthless, stupid, lazy, etc. (I go to an ivy league college, this really couldn't be further from the truth).

Anyway, I moved out halfway through my senior year of high school (would have earlier but my mom wouldn't let us - she wanted to keep us because she got lots of child support money from my dad then she she didn't spend on us). Since then, I have had a cordial though distant relationship with my mom. I go home to my dad's on school breaks and he supports me completely through college. My mom and stepdad have plenty of money, but do not contribute in any way to my expenses (which is their right but off-putting given the amount we are struggling). 

Anyway, I'm perfectly happy with this arrangement, but I do care for and love my half-sister a lot. I was there since she was born, I have cared for her tons, and she really is a great kid in spite of weird circumstances. Because of this, I make an effort to make appearances once in awhile. I hadn't been to my mom's except for a couple times over summer, so I went to Christmas morning today. It was miserable. While they didn't do anything explicitly terrible, I felt so incredibly unhappy. I got gifts from CVS and watched my little sister/mom/stepdad unwrap tons of stuff. This is really, really not about the money or possessions - I don't expect anything or really care for gifts at all. It just felt hurtful. I also think I forget and underestimated the pain of seeing them again, if that makes sense. 

I'm now back at my dad's house. I am supposed to go on a road trip/theme park vacation for the next 5 days with my mom, stepdad, half-sister, and brother (my older sister and mother are not on speaking terms). I agreed because I rarely see my little sister and care about her. But I really, really don't want to go. I am not worried for my safety or anything and I know that I will have freedom since I am an adult now and could leave/take a break from them at any time, but I just don't feel like going through the whole exercise. That said, I don't see my little sister much and feel bad backing out. My mom will also be mad, but I don't care about that much. I'm just really stuck here.

She has had issues with eating disorders, mainly anorexia and bullimia, as well as depression. She has managed to fight off some of those things, but obviously some of them still linger, because as of the last year or so, she has become a hypochondriac.

 She often texts me out of the blue, asking if I've ever had this, or that, and usually it's very small things. Questions like does your tongue ever get white stuff of it? Her most recent worry was that she had some broken blood vessels on her arm from scratching, and her anxiety stopped her from coming out to the lake with us for the day.

15503,Non-Romantic,36snh9,"So I moved across the country for a job in a tropical area. I was really excited, but nervous about making friends since I had a super close friend group at home and am usually slow to form new relationships. Anyway, this girl who moved out here for the job too, lets call her Gina, was placed in an apartment right next to me. We started hanging out a bit last August, and I noticed some things about her personality right away that were pretty off.

- For example, she always and I mean ALWAYS has to be right. She lacks the social skill where you may know that you're right about something, but insisting that you're right and arguing with people until they acknowledge your rightness is just sort of off-putting and may offend people. She's the type of person who is VERY unaware of how the way she says things comes across to others. I believe other people see her as a know-it-all and somewhat abrasive and stuck-up. 

- She lies about a lot of stuff. Even insignificant things. Things like, Oh yeah I've done that or Yep, I've been there. Things that are super unbelievable. She even lied to me about getting raped as a college student. She has lied about her interactions with others. For example, she was dating a mutual friend of ours, and they broke up. She constantly complained about how he was obsessed with her, wouldn't leave her alone, is so annoyingly in love with her, and would laugh about his behavior. I found out later that she was emotionally manipulating him the whole time by saying things like I still love you. I can't imagine my life without you. etc. just to keep him on the line.

- One of the biggies: She always tries to make me look bad in front of others. When I say things, she will mock me and laugh. I think she's trying to be funny? When we're with other people, she will be sure to point out anything slightly awkward or embarassing that I say or do. If we go out drinking one night, and I have a little too much or dance stupidly or whatever, she will bring it up for weeks when we're with other people. Constantly making fun of me. I totally get bantering with your friends, but it seems different with her.

- She seems very fake a lot of the time, and it seems like she's always trying to save face. This one feels a little tougher to explain, but the best way I can explain it is that she always seems like she's trying to make herself look super good. If anything happens that may affect that good image she tries to portray, she won't talk about it or acknowledge it and sweeps it under the rug. I'm not sure if that makes sense. I feel like she's rarely real with me. Everything she says and does seems like it is done to further her own interests or her image. When she does nice things for me or for others, it seems sort of...hollow? I'm not sure how to explain that better.

- This one makes me feel sort of judgmental, but she's sort of promiscuous which bothers me a little bit. She has made out with our mutual friend's boyfriend, has made out with several of our friends, jumps into bed with random people from Tinder, etc. She has had 3 serious boyfriends in a matter of 9 months and acts as if she's going to marry these guys, then gets bored and breaks up with them. She acts very attentive to these guys when they're around, even at the expense of her friends. She will throw me under the bus in from of these guys especially, makes fun of me extra hard, etc. She'll invite my boyfriend and I to go out on a double date with her and her guy, and then will simply talk to her date the entire time, be ALL OVER him, costantly touching him and whispering in his ear, while my boyfriend and I awkwardly sit across the table. Just irritating.

- She has never had any good friends. I talk about my friends from home a lot, and tell funny stories about them or whatever. She never does that. She never talks about her friends, and doesn't have any pictures with friends or anything. I've asked her about it, and she says she's never really had good friends. Our other acquantances out here abroad with us have told me that they don't enjoy hanging out with her and find her personality/behavior off-putting.

I noticed a lot of these personality traits when I first met Gina, but I really wanted a good friend out here because I'm so far from home. We have a lot of common interests and I feel like I can have intelligent conversations with her, but the way she acts and the things she says has really made me not want to spend time with her. I keep dodging her attempts to make plans with me. When I'm around her I feel SO irritated and annoyed by the things she says. Wheneber she mocks me I just feel my blood pressure rise. I feel like when I'm around her I am annoyed most of the time. How can I deal with this? I feel like I need her friendship because I don't have too many solid friends out here, yet I don't enjoy her company as of late. I think I've reached my limit with her. However, I know if I didn't have her out here with me I would feel a lot more lonely because I count on her to go places with me, etc. 

I'm not sure what to do here. Can anyone give me some advice on how to deal with this type of personality? Or would it be better to try and explore other friendships?

Well here is the minor problem I have. I am blessed to have a great husband who has a well paying job and we have a good sized house. It's a 3 bedroom, 2 bath with lots of space.

I know it's not a palace, but it's the largest home on both sides of the family. As a result, we usually host the family for Thanksgiving and Christmas which I am very happy to do!

Here is the problem. My husband and I had our first baby (Yay!) this year. Baby Rose will be 6 months old next week.

While Thanksgiving is only a one day affair, for Christmas we rotate family members who stay anywhere from 3 to 7 days.

But this year we have Rose.

Rose, like all babies, has a fairly tight schedule that we like to keep her to because it makes everyone's life easier.

I get up at about 6:30 to nurse Rose. After nursing I play with her for about half an hour quietly in her room and then put her back in her crib. She then naps until about 8:30 or 9 and then she is up for the day! I will bring her into the living/family room and kitchen and make breakfast, play with her, etc.

Since we only have 1 guest bedroom (the other two bedrooms are me and my husband's room and Rose's nursery) this year we will have an overflow of guests that will be sleeping on the couch and air mattresses in the family room.

Would it be rude of me to tell family they need to be up by 8:30 since that's when our day starts? Rose is a LOUD baby once she's fully awake, she gurgles and babbles in baby speak non-stop except for when she cries or makes that piercing baby shriek/laugh. I really don't want to have to tiptoe around my own house trying to keep Rose quiet. Even if I was feeling up to it, Rose wouldn't BE quiet. And of course I can't leave her in her room by herself.

15547,Non-Romantic,1o7drk,"First off, this will be a lengthy post so I apologize for that up front.
My father never really had a positive influence on my life. He worked 3rd shift and owned a farm, so when he wasn't working he was outside doing chores or taking care of the cows. On top of that, my parents were never really financially stable. We weren't poor, but we scraped by. I first began noticing that my parents had no love for each other when I was around 12 years old. They yelled and argued right in front of me and made it painfully clear that we were poor and that they hated each other. My older sister and I agree that if mom and dad taught us anything, it's how not to be husband and wife. This made such a huge impact on me emotionally, and has influenced who I am and how I feel about the word Dad.

Then during the summer before my freshman year of high school, I met Dave. Dave was an older guy, around 51, and married to a woman who owned a nonprofit organization that helped injured birds of prey (hawks, eagles, owls, etc). 14 year old me was overjoyed. The red-tailed hawk was my favorite animal, and still is, so as soon as I learned they were moving in next door, I rode my bike over and said hello. I originally wanted to see some cool birds up close, which I did, and then I was told I could help with some cleaning if I wanted, so I did. That was the first time I met Dave, and right off the bat, I learned that he was an extremely kind and genuine guy. As that first year flew by, I helped Dave with various building projects to get their bird facility going and got to hear some sage advice from the multitude of stories he told me (seriously, that guy can talk your face off).

I went through high school with the fantasy that I was adopted, and that Dave was my real father somehow and he had moved next door to raise his son. I was told more than a few times by his wife how I looked just like him when he was my age, and that I was basically their second son. Looking back, I think this only fed into my illusionary world. But for some reason I cannot explain, I felt connected to him. I could talk to him about school, my friends, getting rejected by a girl for homecoming. And he would listen, and tell me that I'm a good person and everything will fall into place. Compare that to the conversations I would have with my own dad. You shouldn't buy that truck. Help me feed the cows. My dad never once came to one of my high school tennis games, yet Dave drove me to one at one point. Every day I like my father less and respected Dave more.

 ---

After high school, I didn't see Dave as much. I moved away and could only visit during the summers and holidays. Two summers ago, I heard that he had divorced his wife. I'm back home now, and besides seeing him on the road once every few months in town, I haven't talked with him. I don't know his address and am honestly lost as to how to talk to him again. It's been so long that I feel like everything's changed.

Now that I've matured, I see my dad as a fellow man trying his best to enjoy life, but I still have an empty void in that mentor spot that I relied on so heavily in my youth. As a 23 year old, I want to find Dave and just go fishing or something and talk. I want to let him know that I appreciate everything he did for me back in the day and that I respect him. I also want him to be an active mentor in my life. I don't know how to drive stick, I've never shot a gun, I don't have a clue how to grill a burger, but I know deep down that I want Dave to teach me all of these things that I need to learn.
I have his cell phone number and that's about it. I've told myself so many mornings at work, I should call Dave tonight. I know he's not immortal and that he won't be around forever, and I don't know what I would do if he died before I could thank him. My question is, how do I do it? I can't just call him out of the blue and say, I respect you, please teach me everything. How do I enter such a personal conversation after so long? Is this something better left unsaid? Should I just move on with my life?

Thanks for any advice, I appreciate it.

Last weekend my SO and I got kinda drunk and talked honestly about our families' impressions of each other. He said that his parents thought I was nice/polite and that they want to spend more time with me, and that his youngest siblings (who are in elementary school) think I'm fun. 

However, he said that his 19 year old sister thinks that I don't like her. Of course that's completely ridiculous, as I can't not like someone who I have barely talked to. Also, if she's anything like my boyfriend, I'll definitely like her. When I met her, we were at her parents' house and she seemed kinda busy with homework, so I said hi to her, had a short conversation about Christmas plans, then I left her alone. 

I would think that of all the people in his family, his sister who's closest to me in age would be the easiest to get along with, rather than his parents or his much younger siblings. I asked my boyfriend why she thinks I don't like her, and he seemed as confused as I was. This is especially weird to me, as people who I've just met usually think I'm really nice. Since I really like my SO a lot and plan on being with him for a long time, it really matters to me that his family likes me.

15629,Non-Romantic,360773,"Fiancee and I have been together for about 7 years. We finally decided to tie the knot on a cruise ship this winter, and throw a party for our friends and family to celebrate when we get back. While discussing whether to open up the cruise for wedding invites, we hit a roadblock.  My best friend's boyfriend, also the father of her child. They have been together for over 5 years.

I'll try to describe him without attacking or calling names. He's an alcoholic and pill addict (confirmed, he has on several occasions mentioned his need to get help but hasn't). He works from home and starts his day with a glass of vodka. He's usually incomprehensible by lunch, when he'll sleep off his morning.  By dinner he's usually already had a bottle or so of wine, and keeps going until he passes out at bedtime. The times he is awake, he is belligerent, argumentative, sensitive, and accusatory. He is hard of hearing (tinnitus he says), so unless you are speaking directly at him and loudly, he assumes that you're saying something bad about him and will start saying rude things under his breath to retaliate.  

I have rarely seen him sober.  But when he is, he's a really lovely person. Very funny, interesting, and attentive to the conversation.  

I have seen him at two weddings so far. Once, he was doing cartwheels on the dance floor and crashed into the DJ speakers, and was dragged out by my best friend. At another he started a fight with the best man. 

I really do have dozens of stories where he's been out of control and has made situations extremely uncomfortable for everyone. 

His girlfriend, my best friend, enables him.  She is also a heavy drinker, but not at his level.  She has given up on trying to help him be healthier and simply allows him to continue on this path.  In the few conversations I've had about my concerns (mainly where the boyfriend has been drunk and driven their small child home), she's pointed out that I have driven drunk in the past, and that my fiancee isn't perfect either.  When she has forbade him from drinking, he has hidden it from her and explained away his drunk behavior by saying he took too many pills. 

I really want my friends (including my best friend) and family to have an invite on the cruise, but I don't want him there. A couple hours here and there in a group, I can handle, but not 7 nights on a boat. 

When we all hang out as a group, we all usually tolerate him as best we can without him overreacting, but the mood is always a million times lighter when he's not around. A couple people have flatly refused to come out if he's going to be there. My best friend is always fun, engaging, kind (until someone criticizes her boyfriend), thoughtful, and she's a core part of our group.

15637,Non-Romantic,3718ad,"A couple of years ago I couldn't keep my money on my bank account any more so against my better judgement I entrusted my mother with the money on the condition that I had 100% control of the money no matter what.

She swore on everything holy that she would not take,withhold, etc.. the money was mine and I could do whatever I wanted with it.

I didn't trust her at all and I knew it was a bad decision but I promised myself that if she ever broke this promise I would never see her again, not after all the bad things she's done to me.

I didn't think she would break this promise because I had told her that if she ever did I would never see her again.

Well, she has done it now, after a few years of our deal I started toying with what I might use the money for.

Specifically, at the time I was toying with the idea of buying a motorcycle and taking a road-trip around the world and I was pretty excited about it, I was making plans and had found just the right motorcycle to buy but needed some way of bringing it home so I called my mother, told her about the idea and asked if she might trailer it with her car for me.

She told me she would not trailer it for me because she didn't agree with my decision to buy a motorcycle, and that she would not give me my money for it.

Now I was in the early stages of making plans to buy this motorcycle and my mother thought I was really going to do it but that's not true, I'm not that impulsive I don't have a lot of money so I'm very careful when I buy stuff, especially something as big as a motorcycle.

Buying that expensive motorcycle and going on a road-trip in my situation would have been stupid and irresponsible, and the only reason I considered it was because I'm suffering so much and I'm desperate for change.


So now she won't give me my money because she thinks I will do something irresponsible with them, however if I wanted to do something that she thinks is responsible like get a drivers license(which costs around 2500 usd in my country) she might give me money for that, or so she says..

Anyways, the problem is that she is trying to control me, what I do with my money and this isn't even the worst part! 

I need to use this money for something very important and responsible, you might say I'm starting a business that she doesn't agree with, so I can't tell her what I need the money for or she won't give them to me.

TLDR: How do I get my money back from my mother who doesn't want to give it to me because she thinks I will spend it on something bad, which I wont but the thing I do need to spend the money on is something she does think is bad while I know it's not bad for me.","Hello, how do I[20m] convince my mother[55f] to give me back the money I entrusted her?",0.0,False,24.0,14.0,1432420429.0,/r/relationships/comments/3718ad/hello_how_do_i20m_convince_my_mother55f_to_give/,NonRomantic

My sister Jane and her boyfriend Greg have been together for a little over a year and moved in together a few months ago. They met in college - he graduated last winter and she graduated this spring. I think they're a great couple together and have a really grounded, mature relationship despite their age.

Since we're in different cities on different work schedules, my sister and I email each other pretty frequently and give life updates - we're pretty close and are very honest with one another. A few weeks ago we were talking about Greg's pretty religious family and how they don't approve of them living together because they're not married. I told her that they need to be careful to make their own decisions about getting married. Her response was:

If Greg and I were to get engaged it would be our own choice and have nothing to do with their opinion. And even if we did any time in the near future, I wouldn't even want to tell his family because they would just assume we did it because of them, even if we told them otherwise. **Greg is kind of on the same page with that** so we're not in a huge rush to get engaged or anything. There's so many changes happening at his work and I still have school to do, so we're putting that on the back burner. There's still every intent in it happening, but there's no need to hurry into it. 

(bold for emphasis)

So I thought things were all settled for awhile with my concerns. Today, however, I received a text from Greg asking for Jane's ring size. I know it's not for her right hand (she has a set of rings she wears every day on that hand) and since he asked me, it means it's a surprise. I went ahead and told him, but now I'm wondering if I should (gently) clue him in about what my sister told me.

I don't want him to mess up a good thing - his feeling pressured by his family is completely understandable but this will cause trouble in their relationship. But maybe he's just ordering the ring so he can have it on hand for the right moment in the next year or so and my worrying is all for nothing.

We never had drama or anything like that and we bonded because of our love of writing, and dreamed of writing novels together. He got married about five years ago to Brenda, and I got married like six months after he did. Well, I got pregnant right away and upon finding out we were having a girl, my husband chose a name we both liked. His wife took to Facebook when we announced it and accused me of stealing their baby name. I never even said anything back, because it was asinine that she accused me of that, when she and I never spoke of baby names. She and I weren't even good friends or anything like that... and she wasn't even pregnant!

Later on, she did get pregnant, and posted all over FB how she was upset they couldn't use the name she liked, because people had stolen it from her, so I asked my friend if that was the way he felt, because as far as I remembered, he and I had never discussed anything as silly as baby names during our friendship. He said absolutely not, that someone else had done something to them regarding a baby name and his wife was just upset about it. I let it go, even though it made me upset that she was telling people that I had stolen her name, especially when my kid was born like a year before hers.

Well, fast forward to last year, they got pregnant and found out they were having a boy. Mind you, I have been writing a novel for three years, and my main character's name just happens to be the name they decided to name their baby boy. I published my novel last January and my friend deleted me off FB, blocked me on all social media, and will not speak to me, and I have no idea what to do. I am pretty sure it is because of my main character's name, but I just think that's so silly, I can't fathom anyone just throwing away a friendship over it. He didn't warn me, didn't even try talking to me. If he had, I would have changed the damn name on the novel, it's not a big deal, but this just came out of the blue.

15646,Non-Romantic,2s8k6d,"About two months ago, I started carpooling with a colleague, Jen [34F]. We work for the same company (though in different departments), and when we realized that we live in the same area, we decided to share the hour-long commute to work. I drive one week, and she drives the next. The commute is mostly highway, so gas does cost a lot. I make enough money that I could drive alone, but the extra money in the bank is nice.

Recently, however, I've been having some issues with her driving. To put it kindly, she's irresponsible. I arrive at her house every morning at the same time, and I text her when I am leaving and when I arrive; however, she's always at least ten minutes late getting out to my car, putting me at a bit of a time crunch to get to work. On her days to drive, she'll message me to say she'll be at my building in five minutes, only to show up 25-30 minutes later with an excuse. Every day presents some reason why she's running late, and it's becoming annoying. On top of that, she's an unsafe driver. She'll speed, talk and drive, text and drive, and take her hands off the wheel. She'll try to do her makeup or eat (with both hands) while in the car. I've asked her several times not to do this, and she'll stop for a day or two, but pick right back up. 

Today was the final straw for me. We had a fair bit of snow today, and being her week to drive, she told me that she'd come pick me up in her husband's very expensive AWD crossover, so we'd be safer. It wasn't until the car slid on a side road on our way home that she informed me that the car didn't have winter tires, and the tires that were on the car were a few years old and pretty bald. I was pretty pissed that she'd put me in this unsafe position, because knowing otherwise, I would've driven my own car with brand new winter tires, and chosen to stay with a friend in the city instead of risking my life driving home. 

Needless to say, I want to stop carpooling. However, I'm not really sure how to bring this up to her. I don't trust her driving. But I also don't want to burn any bridges, or come off as rude or harsh. I know when I say I'd rather not carpool anymore, she's going to ask why not. How do I break it to her that I no longer want to share a ride to work? And am I justified in doing so?

We've been best friends since the end of middle school. We've always been there for one another. We even have the same birthday (she's an hour older than I am.) 

In July, we found out one of our favorite bands will be playing in a town over, in November (this week actually). She (let's call her Sally) asked me if I could order the tickets, and she would pay me back when she could. Our birthday was a few weeks away so I told her not to worry, I would pay for it. She kind of pushes that she'll pay, but I won't have it. We were excited, everything was set. 

Then our birthday comes. I go out with the boyfriend for some birthday brunch and my first legal drink. I come home and spend some time with my family, all the while texting 
Sally, trying to meet up and celebrate together. Her replies are hours apart. I give her a heads up letting her know that we were going to have some drinks and that she should come over with her bf. Nothing in reply. 

Later on that night as I was winding down, I check my social medias and I see that she was posting away about how she and her boyfriend made dinner together. That's fine. But the fact that she couldn't let me know what was going on and the fact that she didn't even bother to come over? It kinda hurt. Although this isn't the first time she blew me off for a boy on our birthday. 

A month later, while texting Sally, the concert comes up. I ask if she's going to pay me back for the tickets. I didn't think it was fair that I had to drop 40 dollars on her when she didn't even bother to hang out on our birthday. I didn't even get a card. Just a Happy Birthday! text. She's taken aback by this. She ends up changing the subject, leaving it alone.

The next month, my very close friend (who I consider a brother) comes to town (he's stationed a few hours away). He also loves the band that is coming in November. Together we have seen this band three times live. Its a given that we're going to go see them. I get the idea that I could just give my extra ticket to him and he'll pay me back. (He actually did pay me back).

A few weeks later Sally asks if I still have her ticket. I tell her no. She had many opportunities to make it up to me (she is always going out to dinner and recently went on a trip to an amusement park saying how I should have came with her --she didn't even invite me.) We had plans for Halloween but she never replied. 

I'm afraid we might not get passed this and I don't know how to approach her. We fight like sisters but we haven't spoken in a week and that isn't us. Was I wrong to do that? What should I do?

It's my friend's first relationship with a girl he met through school. A year apart, went on a couple of movie dates, then he asked her out. Yay for him, right? 

They seemed to be going okay at first, like they took it slow and maybe held hands a little. He'd message me telling me about all the fun they'd had just spending time together doing whatever they ended up doing.

By the time they were together for 4 months, he seemed to get a little frustrated at her lack of intimacy. He's the kind of guy that would just love to sit there with his arm around you, but she seemed to be against it completely, to the point where she'd just push him away.

At this point, I tended to just tell him it would be okay over time. I presumed that maybe she was just a little nervous, or just that she wasn't used to anything physical within a relationship.

They had their first kiss 8 months in to the relationship. He seemed aggravated that it took so long, yet relieved that it had finally occurred. I was happy for them both, believing that maybe that bit of awkwardness had worn away now.

However, I think I judged wrongly. In the 4-ish months since this, they seem to have slightly grown apart. She rarely plans to meet him, and when they do they tend to either get bored or annoyed at each other. He tries to cuddle her while she refuses to let him. 

My friend is rather upset about it all. He feels that he loves her, that he wants to spend the time with her and get to know her, but she's never wanting to. He blames himself, claiming that his initial awkwardness is to blame for their current lack of physical affection.

This constant stream of insults makes me insecure, and I've told them this, but they just don't seem to listen. 

Other things my friends like to use to insult me with are my looks, my intelligence, and my love-life, none of which I thought were that bad. But every day they try to make me believe something different about myself, and almost never are these things positive; as a result, I've begun to believe the things that they say to me, and it has made me incredibly self conscious and bitter. 

There was a time where I had confidence, and perhaps that's the problem. I was arrogant, and I doubt that they appreciated that. But the way they just keep kicking me while I'm down is getting increasingly worse, and I want to know how I can put an end to it.

15705,Non-Romantic,3do7in,"My friend Max has struggled with depression for the past few years. I've tried to be there for him. Last winter he got to the point where he was suicidal. I convinced him to go on anti depressants. It worked for a while. He found a new job, moved to a city 3 hours away with friends from college.

I admit, I'm not the best at keeping in touch. I responded to his texts and visited a couple times in the past few months. Today his roommate contacted me saying that Max had said that he didn't think I would miss him if he died and we tried planning a kind of friend intervention to prove that we love him. That's when I got a text from Max telling me what song to play at his funeral. After calling him several times he picked up and made a couple vague suicidal comments. His roommate called the crisis hotline and they are handling the situation right now.

This is the second time he's used the line about me not caring if he died. The first time I was able to get him help and prove that wasn't true. I feel horrible about saying this, but I'm not sure I want to continue being his friend after this. It's kind of the ultimate guilt trip. If he does this again and no one can save him from himself and he commits suicide I will carry that guilt for the rest of my life. It's not fair for him to make me responsible for his happiness and for his choices.

It doesn't help that I had an abusive ex boyfriend who used suicide to manipulate me. Sometimes his threats were manipulation, other times they were real and I had to call 911 to prevent it. I have my own depression and anxiety to deal with, I don't know if I can handle his now, but I don't know how to end the friendship if he's at risk for suicide over it. Can I help him through this? What if this happens again? Of course I would rather help him but, how?

So a few months ago, my boyfriend, me, and a fellow roommate moved in together. I had only met her on Skype but since she was a friend of a mutual friend, I figured she would be alright. We all ended up being close friends and also work at the same company.  While we were driving to work one day, she asked if a friend of hers could stay with us for a little bit. She was leaving a rough environment and wanted to get back on her feet. She said that she stayed past the month, she would pay her rent, though she doesn’t anticipate staying that long. 

That was two weeks ago and it seems that nothing has changed. Now I understand it’s hard to find a job, especially where we live (Chicago), but I don’t think she has done anything. She just seems to go on the internet all day and watch movies and on the weekend, they just go shopping.  My boyfriend has had this happen to him before where a person, who’s only staying for a week, ends up overstaying his welcome and never leaves and really wants to nip this in the bud or at least ask for a progress report.  I agreed, but could never think of hard reasons for her to leave. Yes, she didn’t have a job yet, but wasn’t that normal?

However, a couple days ago, I got a cease and desist (Don’t know if that’s the right term) from our cable company. Apparently, she has been downloading illegal movies while she’s at home. That had me fuming because all the bills are under my name. That looks bad on me and not anyone else. I told my roommate about it and she said that she would tell her. No apologies on either end. I realized that that was the evidence I probably needed.

So here’s the problems I’m having:

1.	Not good with confrontation. Pretty shy myself and never really knew how to be taken seriously
2.	 My boyfriend is also not on the lease. However, I told my roommate about him before we moved in together and she was cool about. He was able to find a job within a week of moving and was able to pay rent regardless. I just don’t want to seem hypocritical if I try to talk to her.


I can't help feel like a bitch for wanting her out. I feel like this was set up so I would feel bad because she most likely has nowhere to go. I’m thinking of waiting until the month is up to bring this up because I did agree on that, but is this enough evidence to wanting her to not be in our apartment?

15718,Non-Romantic,233uin,"**TL;DR:** Close lady friend (28F) and ex-coworker went from chatting with me (33M) daily to no contact. Why?

Just curious as to some reasons why a lady friend of mine has broken friendly contact. 

Some background: I'm (33M) happily married but I also tend to relate more to and befriend women a whole lot easier than men. I mention this only so no one gets the wrong idea here. This lady we'll call Mary (28F) and I used to work together and we chatted daily around the water cooler/instant messenger.  We have much in common and we became fast friends. About a year back she left the company and moved out of town for a better job. I missed my friend but was happy for her. We still chatted from time to time on IM and by text but in the last few months that's dwindled and now she has essentially stopped talking to me all together.  Going back through our convos in my head I can't think of anything I said or did that might have caused this. 

Am I reading too much into this?  Did I send the wrong signals? Is it because I'm married or maybe she has feelings outside of a friendship (FYI she has a long term BF)?  I realize everyone is different and has their reasons but I hope to glean a little insight from your opinions!
