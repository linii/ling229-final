7868,Non-Romantic,2cnwtn,"I've been friends with this one girl since sixth grade. We were in the same group of friends and we've been through a lot with each other. I saw her through her battle with self-harm and depression, while she saw me through some rough times with my mom.

In high school, I was pretty dead-set on getting into an awesome college all the way across the country, which I did, and she ended up dropping out of high school. We definitely had different plans about what we wanted out of life but I never made her feel bad about her choice! Since going off to school, I've seen her at every break and we would FB message/Skype constantly.

I went off on a semester abroad and just came home to start a pretty prestigious internship. The first thing she said to me when I got home from my semester abroad was that she didn't want to hear about it because she didn't care. I was hurt by this and one of the things I did when I was abroad was NOT post an album of all of my photos or make constant statuses about being abroad.

In addition to this, I ended up getting in a relationship with a great guy and when I tried to mention him to her, she told me she didn't want to hear about him either. And this happened the first time I mentioned him to her. Said guy lives in the country I spent a semester abroad, so it's not like I'm ditching her for him. 

This summer she's just been really rude and negative to me. She's been calling me a bitch and making fun of me every chance she gets. Whenever we hang out she completely ignores me and it feels like she doesn't even want me around her. I feel like crap.

She started completely ignoring me on July 19th and hasn't answered any of my texts or snapchats. I've asked her if I did something wrong and I've apologized for anything I might've done but I still have no response.

We had some fun times this summer but now I'm just not sure what happened? I can't think of anything I said or did that would make her upset. I know I was mentioning some stuff about my future (which involves going abroad again) and grad school but I don't think that would have set her off?

Some of my other friends are saying that she's jealous of me, since she's working two dead-end retail jobs and still living at home, while I have my own place, a really great internship, and I'm going to graduate in the spring. I'm not entirely sure that's it. However, I'm not aware of anything going on with her family or any other problems.

Is this entire thing my fault? Is there anything I can do to re-open the line of communication? Or should I just accept that this entire friendship has run its course?

She doesn't work, but knows I can text at work.  But sometimes I get busy (I am very tunnel visioned) and drop everything to accomplish tasks.  She says she doesn't buy it and I just don't care about her because I do this at home too.  I tell her that my home life is different from hers because I have a 4 y/o brother whom I take care of.  She also doesn't think that is a good excuse and that I am selfish and only text her when I want to.  

In a way, I admit I do text her when I want, but its more like I text her when I am not busy.  I don't mind texting, but I hate that she gets mad if I don't reply within fifteen minutes because I don't enjoy this medium.  Sometimes what I do (legal assistant/big brother) does take an hour!  I know it takes a minute to reply but I am focused on what I am doing.  

Whats worse is to retaliate she will ignore me all day after she gets mad.

Okay so first thing first this is a throwaway account and any names or locations mentioned have been altered. Or have they? (It is more to do with getting as much anonymity as I possibly can then wanting to deceive anyone)



Anyway me and my best friend. (Who will go by the name Elias for the sake of this question) go way back. We have essentially known each other throughout the whole of K-12 and we both go to the same college. 


Because of that ( and other reasons I’ll get to later)for the last few years I have found myself more and more drawn to him both physically and emotionally/mentally. The time I started feeling like that coincided with the time that I was finally starting to be comfortable and honest with myself  and work out things such as my sexuality. He too was Bi having come out to me and a few other friends a few months before I decided to. In fact Elias helped me, when I came out to him. Admittedly alcohol was involved but we talked about it and other things similar and it got to a point that we both briefly gave head to each other. Not to the point of climax but I think enough to maybe satisfy a curiosity or open up other possibilities which certainly helped at the time but now doesn't seem like enough. It happened about three years ago and we havent spoke of it since, However there was and still is no sense of awkwardness about it afterwards. We continued joking around like normal our behaviours never really changed around each other



Whilst I have been openly Bi for the last few years to friends at least. ( Ill cross that bridge about telling my family when I feel as though I need to) Being in a relationship is something I have never really cared about or when I did care no one was interested in me so I have never been in one. Elias though currently in a relationship with quite a nice open-minded girl (22 F) But he does from time to time gets a little bit annoyed at how clingy girls seem to be overall and how much less fun they are to be around sometimes. Mentions comment along the lines that guys are just easier to deal with overall ect...



However when Elias says comments like that, a bit of me does start to perk up and jumps to idealistic conclusions/fantasies. On top of this we both now seem to throw around a lot more LGBT specific terminology and aim our jokes more toward that angle and purposely think of insulting or crass flirts to each other for comedic effect.


I do sometimes I wonder though am I just confused with what I'm feeling. Maybe it’s more of a type of admiration than anything else. Elias managed to help me out from problems that one was self-inflicted and the other beyond my control ie: a shit year at college that was happening at the same time that my parents were seriously considering a getting a divorce




Whatever it is I'm feeling it fluctuates sometimes it’s a feeling that you might associate with a great friend or sometimes it can intensify in to something that I still can’t pinpoint yet. This has happened for the last couple of years and now it’s gotten to the point that I'm using a throwaway account on reddit to try and get advice if anything can be advised


I also can’t work out what I’m meant to do if anything at all. We pretty much know so much about each other that nothing will really affect our judgment on one another. So I’m positively sure there is not a friendship at risk. I can’t really work out if he is interested in me or maybe I missed a chance years ago and haven’t realised or am I just misreading the mood or situation.  Sometimes there seem to some hints dropped in terms of body language and things he might say seemingly at random whenever we eat at restaurant he calls them dates, in a joking way. 


I don’t really know what I’m supposed to do about this. Talk about it? Forget about it? Any help that anyone has to offer will be appreciated, and I'm sorry for the long post its almost taken me 4 hours to put this together.

I've been with my girlfriend, Claire, for 6 months now. We first met when she transferred to my school at the beginning of the year, and I felt a close attraction to her almost instantly after meeting her.


Firstly, I'd just like to say that the both of us are very mature for our age, while most people around as just in relationships for the sake of it, I feel as though I really love her, and she DID feel the same.
Things were going well for us, when we first got together I had some doubts, because of a situation with a previous girlfriend, which lead to Claire and myself getting together in a manner that seemed a little rushed, due to not wanting to let the ex girlfriend hurt things between us.


After being with her a few weeks, I started to love her, we spoke every afternoon until one of us fell asleep, spent all day at school together, and the both of us really enjoyed each others company.
Our relationship progressed, I met her parents, she met mine, I kissed her, which was a first kiss for us both, and I'm actually her first serious boyfriend. Things began to get more serious, with talk of sexual ventures beginning to frequent.


From here on, I'm not sure what happened. Another girl game to my school which gave Claire 'bad vibes' and she politely asked me not to talk to her, but because we had mutual friends it was hard to avoid her, and it led to a three day argument between us, which was eventually resolved. I'm not sure if that's what caused the bad situation between us, but it's the only serious thing that has happened that I can think of which would lead to what has happened. Claire began to distance herself, we didn't talk as much as we used to, although still frequent. Her levels of affection towards me dropped, I confronted her in the nicest way possible and suggested that we tell each other the things we like and don't like about our relationship so we can strengthen it. A few minor complaints both sides, nothing serious, and I did my best to fix the things she complained about.


A few days following, I asked her if she thought our relationship could get any better, she said something along the lines of 'It's pretty good, but I'm going to be honest, I've been having doubts recently.' She didn't specify why she was having doubts, and didn't tell me of anything I could do to fix it, but I started being as nice as I possibly could, and things between us were seemingly better than they were prior to her telling me of her doubts. Yesterday, she told me that she's still having second thoughts, that she doesn't think she loves me like she used to, and that she's not sure we can fix it. I don't understand this..


When I see her, she says she loves me, she holds my hand, kisses me, let's me touch her and she even talks of our future, marriage, kids, holidays, etc.


I'm not sure what to do, or how to feel, I'm expecting things to go either way, and it's hard for me to understand exactly what's going on because she says she loves me, then says she doesn't. This morning she told me that she 'needs time to herself' and that she will be back at around 9pm (1:30pm at time of writing) I suggested that we have some time apart, for her to realise what she's got, but of course I didn't say it like that. Before we met, she was lonely and sad. She didn't have anybody, and I know that if we break up that is probably what will come of it, but for some reason she hasn't thought of it like that.


NOTE:
Soon after we met she stopped taking anti-depressants that were prescribed to her by a doctor at a young age, she said that I made her so happy she felt like she didn't need them, but recently she has told me that she's falling back into depression again. This could have a lot to do with the situation..


tl;dr: My girlfriend of 6 months says she's been having doubts in our relationship, despite still showing signs of love. I'm not sure what's going to come of this, and I don't know how to handle the situation or what to expect.","Me [16 M] with my girlfriend [16 F] of 6 months, stage of doubt, close to a breakup.",0.0,False,1.0,1.0,1416107221.0,/r/relationships/comments/2mfost/me_16_m_with_my_girlfriend_16_f_of_6_months_stage/,Romantic

2109,Relationships,1hvcnv,"Hello all,

At 27, I thought that I already had everything figured out as far as what I was looking for in a relationship.  I've been together with my current girlfriend for over 2 years now (living together for only 1 of those years) and we both really love each other.  But for the first time *ever* in those 2+ years, I've begun to have doubts about the future of this relationship and I feel like an absolute jerk for doing so.  I was hoping I could get some outside perspective/advice, maybe from others who have had similar feelings to my own in the past.  Here's a little background to fill in some gaps on my present dilemma.

My current relationship is the first serious, long-term relationship I've ever been in.  That is to say, I've had several relationships in the past (some purely physical and some more emotional), but none lasting more than a couple of months at best.  There just wasn't any real connection with those partners like the one that I felt with my current girlfriend.  This girl is also the first person I've ever even remotely considered starting a family with -- kids, a home, the whole nine yards -- and we've even talked about future plans of this nature together.  She's smart, beautiful, sexy, kind, funny.  So what's the issue?, you may be asking yourself.  And I wouldn't blame you for being a little puzzled at this point.

You see, my problem is ultimately that, the longer my current relationship goes, the more I begin to nitpick and try to analyze things about my partner that I think might be warning signs of a failed relationship down the road.  For example, I mentioned that we've talked about starting a family together in the future, but I feel like my girlfriend is also very unorganized and unmotivated in terms of certain aspects of her life (like helping out around the house, running errands by herself, etc.).  So of course, being a guy, now I have this idea in my head (and perhaps wrongly so) that her current behavior could be indicative of how difficult raising children with her might be.  There are other examples that I worry about -- such as being unable to communicate with me verbally on important topics even after having been dating for 2+ years -- but I came here to find help on my dilemma, not slander my girlfriend, so I'd be happy to provide additional examples of what I consider to be warning signs if requested.

The other issue -- which I'm slowly starting to realize is probably just an indication that *I'm* a terrible person, and not that something's really wrong with our relationship -- is in regard to sex and attraction (both physical and emotional).  I once heard a saying that (roughly paraphrased) goes something like:

No matter how beautiful a woman, there will always be a man who is tired of her.

Horrible and shallow, I know.  I used to think it was a ridiculous saying made up by grown men with the emotional capacity of a 4-year old.  But, sadly, this phrase has always stuck with me; almost to the point where I feel like I've been poisoned by it somehow.  You see, for the first time in two years, I've started to debate whether I'm really cut out for a committed, exclusive relationship, and whether or not I'm even worthy of dating my girlfriend because of these doubts.  On the one hand, I fully appreciate and respect the act of monogamy -- of creating a bond and a life with another individual -- but on the other hand, I've also started to hear the voice of that biological, masculine asshole kick in.  You know the one... the voice that tells our gender to go screw everything and everyone we possibly can.  I used to think I was above fantasizing about other women while in a committed relationship with someone I loved.  But after 2+ years together, I feel like I'm in danger of turning into that guy that marries his girlfriend (whom he genuinely loves and cares about), but still goes through the rest of his life thinking, Man, I wish I could have that girl too.  I really don't want to be that guy, but what if this means that I'm just not cut out for a serious, exclusive relationship?  Because these feelings I'm starting to have are certainly making me doubt my previous convictions on the subject of marriage and monogamy in general.

I know what you're probably thinking.  Great, it's just another guy who's afraid of commitment and is looking for an excuse to regain his independence.  And you know what, maybe you're right.  Maybe I am nitpicking my girlfriend's behavior because I'm subconsciously trying to find a way out of this relationship.  Maybe I am just a typical guy who thinks about nothing but sex and is starting to doubt whether he's actually capable of maintaining a life-long relationship with a single person.  All of that could be true... but you see, the real reason that I've come to you all today is because... quite frankly...

I'm scared.

I'm scared by what I'm starting to feel after two years together with the person that I love and consider my soul mate.  I'm scared at the thought of continuing a relationship that will ultimately lead to marriage, and then kids, and could just as easily end in divorce like my parents' marriage did; which could have been prevented by just calling things off now.  I'm scared that I'm not cut out for a serious relationship, or that I don't really deserve my current girlfriend for even thinking these things, or that there's a chance that I may die alone and with no family of my own; all because of some barbaric biological urges.  I'm scared of constantly obsessing over my relationship like this, but I'm also scared of lying to myself and ending up like so many other couples I know; unhappy, but stuck.

I'm 27 years old... and I'm starting to wonder whether *anyone* can genuinely claim that they understand how love or relationships really work.  I don't know if what I'm feeling is normal... or a sign that I'm a monster.  Any thoughts, comments, or advice are more than appreciated.  Because when you're as confused and conflicted as I am, sometimes the only solution is to turn to someone who's already been through the same thing...

For example; two days ago at a friends housewarming party one of her old classmates was present. She asked the guy if he had heard from a mutual friend, who happens to be the hostess' ex. Normally it wouldn't be too bad, but this particular ex cheated on her, and then dumped her a few weeks after she forgave him, so obviously she doesn't like to talk/hear about him, and our friend knows this.


This same friends has been putting on some weight, not a lot, but she used to be very tiny/skinny (105lbs), and has some self-esteem issues about it. At this party were three of our male friends (one of whom the hostess has had a crush on). The hostess and said friend were talking about the weight-gain and she subtly whispers her new weight. Our friends then blurts out 130 lbs!? in a loud and incredulous voice so everyone can hear it, and the look on the hostess' face said it all.

The only problem is that I can’t see him very often because he’s not allowed to go out much, and when we do he can’t stay out very late at all. We used to just see each other twice a week MAX, but now that’s been reduced to only once a week (His mother said he was going out too often, and she decided this after we hadn’t been able to see each other for a week). It’s putting a strain on our relationship, and we have a limited amount of time together before I leave for school in the Fall. He’s taking summer classes, so it’s understandable that he can’t do much during the week. But he’s completely free on the weekend!


 He’s 20, and about to enter his last year of undergrad but his mom thinks he’s not ready for a license even though he has a car sitting in the driveway gathering dust. It would be great if he could drive because he lives like an hour away from me, and we could take turns instead of having to rely on me to drive us everywhere. The other day he told me that he found out she tracks his iPhone… he actually had to turn it off when he was at my house.


What really bothers me is that he just takes all of this. Any time he’s been unable to do something it’s always, “sorry my parents won’t let me” blah blah blah. And it sounds like he doesn’t even try to convince them (especially his mom) otherwise since he doesn’t see anything wrong. I understand he lives under their roof, relies on their money, etc. But this level of control is definitely not normal, he’s getting way too old for this and needs to become more independent at some point. 


I would really like to talk to him about this, but I don’t know how without offending him or making it sound like I don’t respect his parents. I don’t want to attack him, or tell him to disrespect his mother. So, what are ways I can guide him to become more independent and stand up for himself? There’s definitely ways he can compromise with them, I just don’t know how to bring this up in a conversation. 


**TL;DR:** My boyfriend’s mom doesn’t let him go out much, and we need all the time we can get before this becomes a LDR, I don’t know how to tell him how much this bothers me without offending him or telling him to disrespect his parents.

I've always had problems with my family, because of the simple fact that they always taught me that, amongst other things,  I shouldn't judge anyone because of their family, wealth or look.  

Well, when it came the moment of the truth I saw that that was all a lie. My parents, especially my mother, didn't want me to date my ex because he came from a family that didn't had much money. I understand that they want the best for me, but there are things that are simply stupid. Especially when this comes from my mom, that also didn't came from a wealthy family. 

**SO**

I'm with my SO from 9 months now and I'm really happy with him. He is the best person I've ever known, and does everything for me, like, everything. He is like the prince charming that I thought didn't exists. 

I met him in college and we live in different cities (like 35/40 minutes apart). I know it doesn't sound much, but I'm still working on my driver's license and he doesn't have a car so, for example, now, during this three months of holidays, I only saw him twice. And we have one more year in the same college. 

He works a lot to be where he is today. 


**SO and parents**

My parents like him a lot when they met him. He is nice, sweet and smart. Everything was cool until they find out that he came from a poor family. 

My father told me You can do better, and still has no idea how much that hurted. 

My mother started pointing out bad things about him, that didn't even made sense, and then, talked about his lack of money. I said that he worked a lot to have what he has and studies a lot because he wants to be someone in life. I'm so very proud of him.

My mother agreed that if he was a hard worker that it was fine, even thought that, he and I spend a two months saving money to go to a trip in another country, and my mother forbade me to post any pictures with him online. She didn't want the rest of my family to see me with him.

Everything felt apart when they saw that he has tattoos. Just everything came back and I know it was because of that. 

The thing is, I went to his house during 4 or 5 days, and we talked about he visiting me for a few days also ( he already came by a few days when everything was fine - a few months ago ). 

But know, that everything is bad again, my father told me that he didn't want it, and now I have no idea what to tell my SO. I'm so afraid I will hurt him. He is already so subconscience about his money.

What do I tell him? And how ?

Also, I've very much concerne how this is effect me/us in the future. I honestly understand that my parents want the best for me and they are worried about my future, but I feel this is more than that. My parents are ashamed. 

It hurts me that my parents would prefer for me to be with a rich asshole that someone that, even thought his money, makes me feel the best person alive and does anything for me.

29412,Relationships,2rqovs,"I've been dating my girlfriend for two years and she really wants me to propose to her sometime soon.  I, on the other hand, still can't decide if I would be happy living the rest of my life with her.

On the one hand, I'm always happy when I'm with her.  We have a lot of fun together and I know that I do love her.  No regrets about this relationship at all.  We've lasted this long and I see no reason why we couldn't go on longer.

On the other hand, she shares zero of my interests.  I can't have a solid discussion with her about politics, economics, math, science, and definitely not any of the sci-fi / fantasy things I enjoy.  Over the years we've managed to find plenty of common ground, and she's more than happy to come along with me when I do something she's not interested in.  But it's not the same as being with someone who's actually excited about it.

It feels very grass is always greener on the other side to me.  I don't know if I'm being picky or if I'm settling.  I know I love her and it actually hurts to think about losing her, but can I really commit the rest of my life to someone I'm not 100% on?

I've put off answering this question for a long time, and now I'm deferring it to you.  Thanks!

8891,Breakups,1knpp3,"Four weeks ago I discovered she had lied about her whereabouts. Three weeks ago she broke up with me. Two weeks ago she tells me she still loves me despite sleeping with another guy. Last week she turns up to our place (shared) unexpected and starts asking if I have been seeing other people. Up until this point I had not text her for 6-7 days and the last text was please do not contact me.

Hello, it's been rough. There's only so much advice friends can give, who have a person connection to my, and her, and so I am turning to you beautiful people of Reddit. 

Four weeks ago, my (then) partner was working an extra shift, and I had started dinner. Standard procedure, help each other out and all that. Usually, she would come home starving, and I would have the food ready for her, and vice versa. However, something was up. Not only was it already late, she said she was dropping a friend home and would be an hour. This friend lives 5 minutes from work, and even with traffic, it would be a maximum of around 20-25 minutes. So, over an hour had passed and with my gut already telling me that something was up, seeing as how (as said previously), she is usually starving and tired. There was reason to have doubt in my mind at this point as for the passed three weeks prior to this event (so, seven-eight weeks ago to the date of this post) she was bitching about her new manager, then a week later and a two hour phone call (what?) with him, she was singing his praises. She even went as far to tell me that he asked if she had ever cheated on her boyfriend, and that he would make her cheat. When I heard this at the time, I held my anger, and knew that I was dealing with a real charming person. I asked that if she is brought up in work related conversations, that I don't want to know about him.

More time passed, and I text her, but hers were becoming less frequent. So, I got her attention. I took a stab in the dark at her iCloud login, and found the location of where she was (very, very wrong of me, I honestly do realise that). She was in the location of where this guy lives, as a simple Facebook search revealed. I text her saying something along the lines of Oh, okay, what time are you back from &lt;actual location&gt;?, to which she responded with a question mark, and turned her phone off (couldn't call her, and iPhone stopped tracking). She strolls in at 5:30am the next morning, an hour before she leaves for work, and showers, and tells me how angry she is with me, that she doesn't want to talk or look at me. Guilt, I assume.

The next day, I am furious, I am unsure of what the hell is going on. I am working from home and call her on her break. She maintains the stance. She avoids seeing me all day, and goes out with her friends that night (Friday). The next afternoon, I sit down for three hours with her and ask her what on earth is going on? She states that I was wrong for invading her space -- I admit that I am. I tell her that she is wrong to lie -- she admits that she is. She says that she hasn't been putting me priority lately (she has been seeing and texting multiple 'friends' that she dare never bring back to meet me for some reason). 3 hours later, we are very happy, she says she will be making great efforts in to the relationship because she would rather have me than these new friends. So, she goes out again with her friends, comes back quite early that night and it all seems fine. Usual hugging, and laying around with each other as I had to rest my leg from a slight sports injury. Then she decides to bring up that she has made plans with her friend to go to the Zoo (not her new manager) tomorrow (Sunday) and that she feels bad if she says no to him because she has let him down so many times. That after this she will repay me hundreds, and she just has to get this out of the way. She texts me saying that she is just going for food and a drink with him (quite late) and she will be leaving after that. After that, she text me saying she is having trouble getting back because of the trains. Long story short, she comes in late, and I am moody because we literally did nothing together all day, as she left me and her friends on the sofa whilst she went to meet some guy. I tell her to save her breath and I am furious but don't want to say something I regret.

Monday. I go to her phone, I turn on her iCloud as she disabled it, and I go about my day to work. I get about as half way through my commute and feel awful. I text a few long messages, the first of which says I feel terrible, I have re-enabled iCloud on your phone, I need you to know that I want to work on this -- it's all positive, and constructive. But I don't think she saw my first message about iCloud. We're texting back and forth most of the day as she finishes early most week days. Until it comes to a grinding halt. I hold off for a few hours, and think, oh that's weird. I DO NOT check her iCloud, but trust her and call her first. We make plans for tonight, to go cinema, eat together, etc. I then ask how comes she took so long to text back, and she says that her battery was dead. I was confused. How could her battery be dead after a few hours of infrequent use. She was at work and wasn't allowed it. I proceeded to ask where she was. She said at a friends. I instantly hung up. I went on iCloud, and there she was, clear as day, with the new manager. The manager which she said she wouldn't see as a friend anymore. The manager she said she doesn't have feelings for.

I text her saying you're with him, aren't you?. She says Yes, I am with him. He listens to me. You can either deal with it or its over.. At this point, I was so surprised at how quickly her tone had changed. Needless to say, she didn't come home that night. The next morning, she did, at 5:30 am again. I put the kettle on and asked her if she wants to finally get to the bottom of this and sort it all out. She agreed. So, for around 45 minutes, she's there blaming me for making no effort in the relationship (which we addressed on the Saturday before) and that I don't listen. That this guy does. That he pays for everything (as do/did I), etc. I ask what has changed, and she starts getting mad at me. It was a long conversation, but long story short, she decided to break up with me, despite us living together, and with her twin (and her twins boyfriend). 

So, by this point, I am so, so confused. She has said she hasn't loved me for six months, etc. I am foolishly chasing after her for a few days. Sending 2 dozen roses to work (which everybody thought the new manager sent), and I try to build ground and get to the bottom of everything. I invite her round for lunch on the Friday. You should have seen how awesome this lunch was. Everything she loves. We get on well up until she starts shouting at me out of the blue. Saying I have made no effort lately. I simply say that I am going to go upstairs until she calms down. I come down and she is calmer. We go in the garden and chat, and she says that she isn't sure what she wants or what we will be. She needs time. I agree that we both do.

Later that night, I go out drinking with my brother. Strangely, very strangely, the new manager's EX-GIRLFRIEND adds my brother on Facebook and LinkedIn. Strange timing, right? (His ex and my brother studied together years ago, were never close) My brother gets furious. He texts (the now ex, I suppose) saying to leave me alone and what she is doing is taking the piss. He gets more drunk and runs away when I go to the toilet, and shouts abuse at her. I only catch the tail end of it. I eventually get a call from her being abusive towards me. I say some things in a drunken rage, and threaten the new manager. I knew I was on loud speaker. 

During this time, she is bringing the new manager back to our place. Which I asked her at that lunch never to do. Out of respect to me and the other people there. She does it, and the new manager speaks to the other house mates. The guy house mate has my back and tells them both they need to spend time away from each other and stop taking the piss. To really consider things. Her twin is caught in the middle and isn't sure what to do. Anyway, I found this out a few days after as they didn't think I was ready for the information. I probably wasn't. 

Time passes by over the week, and I am racking my brains about how this has happened. I eventually manage to get the new managers phone number. I call him, turns out that he is at work. He says he will call me back in 5 minutes. He does. I apologise, and I was honestly sorry for everything I said in my rage. I shouldn't threaten people, especially not over the phone. No matter how much he is hurting me. Now, she had been lying so much, that I thought I would give it a go -- I said she told me that you guys slept together, but she didn't say which date, and I'm trying to make sense of whether we were together or not. He replied with to be honest, I don't remember the date, but it was a few days before she head off to training for her new job. My heart sank. I went on to be honest and tell him that as far as I was concerned, I didn't see out break up as even a break up, we've had far worse fights, and I thought we were just hurting each other because we were upset. I told him everything from my perspective, and even the horrible things she had said about him. He was not happy with her.

An hour later I received a call from her crying, and asking why I am trying to ruin her life. I said that she could have just told me if she wanted to see other people. If she wanted to sleep with other people, or if she had slept with other people. Rather than allowing me to offer her out to dinner, buy her roses, and generally keep chasing something that was merely out of reach. She kept saying that she still loved me, and that she has such strong feels for this new manager, that I don't know how it feels. 

She comes back for the weekend -- I don't see her. Then, she is away for another week, out of the country. No contact. The Saturday just passed, I am watching football (soccer to a fair amount of you), and she turns up, out of the blue, unexpected, whilst the other housemates are away for the weekend. My heart sinks. She looks beautiful. She's clearly made an effort. She comes in and is quite cheeky, and playful. I invite her to sit down and have a drink, maybe some food. She says she can't stay too long because she to go to a comedy club -- I can do with a laugh she says (likely doing with the new guy). She also says that she is just picking up a necklace. Okay, sure. I say I wish you would have called ahead before, I'm trying to get over you and this isn't going to make it any easier. I realise she pays rent for this place, guys, but I just ask for 6-8 weeks. She has a place to stay in the meantime anyway. She says that its inevitable, that we will see each other and the feelings will keep coming back. I say this isn't fair, and I just need space. Eventually, we move on the conversation...

Have you had any girls round, have you been with other girls? was the immediate first question. I told her that its not fair her being able to ask such questions, and that its no longer her business. I said it kindly in the most neutral way possible. Yet, she persisted. She settled on 'yes', where as I remained on 'this is not fair'. Moving on, I asked if they are together, and she replies with unlikely after what you said to him. Anyway, she walks out the door with a laugh, and we seem to be getting on. But I maintain the stance that she should call ahead.

The next day, its on my mind so much, that she can be so cheeky, and audacious to ask such questions and forcefully enter back in to my life just as I was getting in to a decent place. I felt like she undone everything that week had accomplished. So, I call her the next day (yesterday) and ask her to meet me. We meet at a lake, and she instantly says that she feels she is being set up. I offered that she picks a location that suits her, but she didn't. We get half way round the lake before she starts accusing me to tearing her and her sister apart, of threatening the new managers mother, and of portraying her in a bad light. She says that she told me that they slept together (she didn't, I had to find out in order to let it rest). She just kept shouting at me. Such a contrast from the day before. Maybe the new guy had said something -- after all, he does seem somewhat manipulative.

I have enough of this, and tell her, right, you're coming with me and you're seeing your sister. She refuses and is very reluctant but I insist. I had to take control. She comes in and talks with her sister. After 20 minutes, she comes down and apologises, we hug and she walks out of the door.

Now, after this eventful tale, which is obviously from my perspective (and I try to admit to my wrongs) but is factual. The problem is, and what I need another insight in to, is how do I avoid seeing her when she has threatened to turn up as she pleases? How do I get the money back she owes me? (quite a lot) 

I cannot simply move, as I am tied in to a contract, and the rent is silly cheap. I am in debt, and cant afford much. This is a really good place. But she can come and go as she pleases, when I need to maintain no contact. 

Many people tell me that she is enjoying this, that she knows because I still care, she feels wanted. Having cake and eating it, for example. People also predict that this new relationship will not last, but I hope that does not become my issue. 

What would you advise: ride it out, see what happens or take some kind of action? I feel as if I am stuck in a TV episode.

40,Breakups,2s7xfo,"Here's the situation, my girlfriend of a year left me for someone on the sports team we were both on while I was taking a semester off to focus on studies. 

Here's some background. I was in a near-sighted relationship last summer for a month with a girl, went back to college, realized how hard distance was with someone I didn't have a solid foundation with, and broke up with her. During this time I had a crush on another girl, but she was in a relationship, so I didn't really have intentions of getting into something with her. Well, then, after the break-up I get close with this other girl. We hit it off and then she confesses her feelings for me and leaves her long distance boyfriend of two years for me. I even tried to keep them together, but I still felt partly responsible.

Now, this made me feel pretty special that someone thought I was so important that they would leave a committed relationship for me. Well, after about two month, I broke up with her because I wasn't really feeling it anymore. Then we got back together. Dated for a couple more weeks, then I broke it off again. We then went on break and I kept away from her, but tried to stay friends. During this time, we grew closer and she popped the question, Do you still have feelings for me? I answered truthfully and we dated until the summer. Beginning of summer, a month and a half in, I break up with her for a day. I don't even know why, I just did. It's like all the information was saying, Date her! She's really good for you! but I wanted out. I immediately regretted my words and we got back together the next day. We dated for the rest of the summer.

During August, we had a large fight and I said some nasty things, but I took some time and thought things over. I ended up talking to her about how I had been wrong, that I had been acting like a child and not completely investing myself, and that I was ready to seriously be in the relationship 100%. Things improved after this and we grew closer. I had finally found what was holding me back, there was honestly a deep part of myself that was scared to say I love you and mean it completely. Everything was starting to make sense and now we could still have good time, still talk about our feelings and what we valued and whatnot, still communicate problems (or so it seemed), still enjoy each other, but it was sweeter for me at this point. 

Beginning of the semester, this new guy from the sports team we were both on tells her that he liked her. She told him she had a boyfriend, but he told her that he was going to continue liking her and flirting because he had to worry about his own happiness. Couple weeks go by and she's listening to the mix tape he made her, so I talk to her that night about if anything was going on. Basically had to pull it out of her that she was developing feelings, but she assures me that she values our relationship and wants it more than anything and that she loves me. So, then a couple weeks later, everything seems to be alright, and I visit her home with her. I get to spend time with her family, see her home town, go shooting with her father, and stay in her house. We talked normally while there, it was our anniversary, so I reminded her how much she means to me and how I had indeed made big changes internally ever sense the summer. That I was so happy with her. 

Two days after that she breaks up with me for this new guy, saying that he said she was the one. She kisses him that night and sleeps there. We talk the next day and stays over. She says she needs time away from both of us. She ends up fucking him the next night (two days after breaking up with me). This crushed me especially that she couldn't even let the dust settle in our relationship before moving on.


It's been 3 months since this all happened. It's been rough because it's just so goddamn hard to know what to feel anymore and to let go of the person she seemed to be. I mean, we were really good friends while we dated. That and she and the guy she left me for are on the sports team that I'm returning to this semester, so that's just fucked. I've talked to other women, and no connection seems to look good for more than a few days. Help me out. I just don't know why someone would work so hard for me just to end it like this or how she could just turn off her feelings for me like that.

**tl;dr**: How do I move on from the pain from my last relationship while I'm on a sports team with my ex and the guy she left me for?

Update: Thanks everyone who said something. It's more of the same I've been hearing, so I guess I just need reminders every now and then, and to actually listen. I think I'm staying on the team, but I'll keep my head up and continue to put myself out there. I don't mean to whine and then not do anything about the problem, but I've been on this team since I started college, I'm arguably the best at what I do for the team, and I can't run away from what I enjoy just because someone else broke my heart. I just need to accept that she isn't someone that deserves to be in my life anymore, not in a mean way, but for my own good.","My [21M] girlfriend [20F] of 1 year left me for another guy, it's been a couple months and I'm still confused/trying to move on.",0.0,False,2.0,8.0,1421105168.0,/r/relationships/comments/2s7xfo/my_21m_girlfriend_20f_of_1_year_left_me_for/,Romantic

Dated my ex for 2.5 years but broke up for about a month this past November. The first breakup was fairly easy for me. I got over the initial devastation and heartbreak relatively quickly (as surprising as it sounds). 

Then we got back together in December. Everything went really well until a couple weeks ago- then it all came crashing down. He broke up with me citing that our respective insecurities about the relationship were too complicated to try and work through. I asked him to try and fix things with me. He said no. Hence- he broke up with me. 

This breakup is harder for me. Substantially. Today I had a fantastic day and I thought I was moving in the right direction with the breakup. I was the kind of happy that makes you dance like an idiot in your car and grin so hard your face hurts. Initially I was excited that I was able to be so happy with such fresh heartbreak, etc.

Then all of the sudden I was hit with an overwhelming urge to share my happiness with my ex. I wanted to talk to him and tell him how great I thought he was and how utterly joyous I felt. The realization that this was my response to happiness hit me like a ton of bricks. I tried not to let the realized heartache impact my mood too much- but I can't get that urge out of my mind. 

The first time we broke up I never experiences anything like this. I'm afraid that I can't get over him in sadness or in happiness.

Recently my SO came over to my parents' house.... there were some issues- it's not as if he spit in their faces or anything, but there were enough hiccups that I got several lectures today. After much debate, my parents officially don't like him. Ok, fine. That's not an uncommon problem (although it'd be nice if they liked him). My father thinks he's immature and doesn't think things through very well. While this is true to a point, my SO has come a long way in these six months (no, I didn't force him to change, it was his own choice). Quite frankly, we love each other and are happy together.

**The relationship**

There are many reasons I want to break up with her. She takes her stress out on me passive-aggressively, and uses guilt like no one I've ever met before. When she is very stressed I get tense in anticipation of insults and she takes this as evidence that I don't care about what she's going through, and - *when I try to actively comfort her!* - will say things like fine I guess you don't care, it's okay, just go do your own thing, I'll stop talking about it in a very angry tone. She has a terrible temper, is easily set off, and always assumes the worst of intentions [of everyone], that people are personally slighting her when usually it's nothing of the sort. She is clingy and controlling of how I spend my time, gets passive-aggressively guilt-trippy if I am remotely distracted for 10min even after spending all day with her, and doesn't count any time to be quality time except if we are at home together, alone, not watching a movie or anything. She considers time spent at work, at lunch, commuting, or seeing friends together to be more like apart time, yet also demands to do all those things, gets sulky if I don't want to, and gets sulky or snappy or passive-aggressive if I'm on my phone or otherwise distracted during those things (including on the damn bus). So when I take alone-time for myself as I've always told her I need to, as an introvert, she says it's fine but then at random intervals gets very upset and guilts me about us never spending time together.

Our sex life is heavily featured on /r/deadbedrooms and although she claims to want to work on it, I have realized that time and time again, she either intentionally lies or unintentionally just has no idea about herself and just says what she thinks I want to hear. Early in our relationship she told me all sorts of things like that she did not have a temper, that she had a high libido, that she valued alone-time and didn't want to be attached at the hip. I took this all at face-value, because *I* am very introspective so I assumed she was too, and have been the frog in the slowly boiling water until fairly recently. I said each of those things first, and she just agreed wow - me too!

**Realization**

Our relationship has always been rocky because she is a very interpersonally aggressive personality. 

I realized I need to leave on day #1 of her being gone for the summer, five days ago (no phone access for the whole stay, only shoddy internet). I was so fucking unbelievably relieved that I was heading home to an empty apartment, one where no one would be guilting or trying to control me or berating me. We do have good times too, but now removed from the positive reinforcement I get, I can see all this bullshit for what it is. My options are to (1) wait until she returns in several months, fake it until then and rip the rug from under her; sounds horrible. (2) Tell her I have something serious to talk about when she gets back. She will push to know what it is even though she hates text-based serious relationship discussions so this isn't REALLY an option. (3) Break up with her over the internet (in text; skype is a no-go).

After much discussion on DB I want to just get it over with, even though I feel like an asshole doing this online, because I don't see a better option. **But I don't know how honest to be in my break-up speech.**

-----

**tl;dr**: Have seen the truth about toxic relationship. I've never broken up a serious nor long-term relationship before. Do I tell her that she is manipulative, passive-aggressive, and toxic to me? Or do I word it like we are just incompatible people and we are not good for each other? How honest are you supposed to be? How honest would you want YOUR partner to be? I feel like being too honest is also inviting a fight about our negative qualities AND/OR her arguing about how she isn't manipulative, isn't passive-aggressive, isn't mean etc. It's not up for discussion, I know it to be true, but I know she will argue against that also.

About two months ago she had to give me a ride home and I broke down crying (im bipolar type2), and she asked me to go to church and I told her I'm not religious and it wouldnt be my cup of tea.  I didnt feel anything about her during this time and after a month went by she advanced on me again, you know, touching me while passin by, some random flirting, which I never moved on to, because I felt she is way out of my league(I'm the ugly one ;p) and she asked a coworker to ask me how big my dick was and also commented if I asked her out she would say yes.  

So I took this way to far and opened it up and told her I was interested and would like a relationship, I'm self aware I romantize to much, and went to far and she shelled up, plus I could tell the office could tell we were being an item and she totally ghosted me. We still texted every now and then and after saying some kinda bad to her, I told her I was sorry I was said it and I have been off my meds for 4 months, and I planned to get help, she didnt really say anything.

22176,Non-Romantic,1ncre9,"**Backstory:** (for easier reading: Ex-friend will be named Ashe)

We met in fifth grade and had been best friends until a year after we graduated (2011). In tenth grade, she got into a relationship with a guy (J) that lasted until around the time we stopped talking to each other. The two had a tumultuous relationship that escalated after they got engaged. I tried to play mediator between the two (stupid move, but at the time, I was asked to) and ended up getting too involved in their relationship. Ashe ended the relationship and it destroyed J. He called me one day and asked to talk because he was depressed, so we hung out with one of his friends. I also found out that he started cutting and was becoming increasingly suicidal in the aftermath of the breakup. One night, he blurts out that he had romantic/sexual feelings towards me, which put me in a tight spot because: a) I knew he was rebounding, b) Ashe was still my best friend and it was wrong to do anything with him, and c) I was terrified that turning him down would make him harm himself more. I let him know my feelings towards what he said and he was okay with it (however, I pulled his best friend aside and asked to keep an eye on him to make sure he wouldn't go off the deep end). Well, a few weeks later, we got high together and ended up having sex. I instantly regretted it. Ashe finds out by going through his Facebook and seeing the messages between us and blows up at the both of us. I was eventually able to get her alone and talk to her about what happened, acknowledging that I fucked up and apologizing for betraying her trust. She said that it was okay and I thought things would soon get better. She later deletes/blocks me on Facebook, tells our mutual friends, one of whom harasses me about it, and generally hates my guts. We'd see each other from time to time (small town/went to the same community college/still have mutual friends) and she'd basically treat me like I don't exist. 

**Present:** 

I ran into her last week at Dunkin Donuts on my way to work and asked her for her number, fully expecting her to either ignore me or tell me to fuck off. Weirdly enough, she gave it to me. I texted her later on in the day to see if we could talk and she gave let me know when her days off were. Later on in the week, I asked again if we could talk over coffee, but she wouldn't answer my calls or texts, so I let it be. Yesterday, she called/texted me, but when I answered, she didn't respond. So, I'm currently at an impasse on what to do.

28658,Relationships,1zfhi8,"This is my first relationship ever, other than a brief two-week one in high school.  I grew up in a very religious community where sex was something preserved for marriage.  My partner and I were both penis-in-vagina virgins before we were together.  We've slowly been becoming more intimate sexually as the months have gone by as we both have become comfortable with each individual sexual act.  I've been mostly the one setting the pace of our sexual exploration.  We always use protection, we've both been tested, and we always make sure not to push each other where we're comfortable.  My partner has been expressing interest in having penis-in-vagina sex (which I'm now going to refer to as sex from now on), however I don't know if I'm prepared for that.  Here is my pros and cons list:

What's stopping me:

* I don't know if I could handle becoming pregnant.  Even if the risks are 1/10000 that seems like a lot to me.  Becoming pregnant would have significant negative effects on my life and our relationship.  If I had an abortion I believe it would be traumatizing for me.  I really really don't want these negative effects, a lot more than I want sex.  
* I don't really think my partner really understand these risks, even though I've shown him the statistics and explaining how I feel about it he occasionally makes comments like With an IUD and condoms, getting pregnant is like a one in a million chance.
* My family is verrrry fertile.  My mom got pregnant at 45 with an IUD and taking the pill.
* Penis-in-vagina has higher STI transmission risks.  Since we're getting re-tested soon this isn't a very big issue. 
* I am sexually satisfied with our current sexual life.
* If we try it and I don't enjoy it what will happen?  Will we continue to have sex or will we be able to backpedal?
* I'm kinda scared of the whole thing in general.

What's pushing me:

* I would really want to have sex if it didn't have any risks.
* I want to have sex anyway.
* He's been super patient with me.  I'm pretty sure if I want to not have sex for the entire course of our relationship he won't leave me.  Pretty sure.
* Non-penetrative sex takes a long time, and perhaps we would have sex more often if we could get off quicker.
* I worry that I'm not being fair to him and am being a worry-wart.  Most people aren't as risk-adverse as I am when it comes to sex.

For me this quandary is sort of like saying Hey, here's a button where you and your friend are very likely to get pleasure shot straight to your brain if you press it.  However if you press it there's a chance your whole world will implode.  There are some things you can do to reduce the risk of that to near nothing, but that will always be a possibility.  Also, your friend wants you to press it and maybe if you do press it they won't want you to stop pressing it and if you do than your friendship will become strained/small possibility of being over.

 Kyle usually acts really immature and rude towards me saying things like ew when I come over to their house and telling me I look ugly. Immature stuff. He also gets very possessive of Dean, my boyfriend, and gets upset when Dean and I spend time together. Kyle has complained about me stealing Dean from him. 


Recently, Dean has encouraged me to try to get along with Kyle. With that in mind I've tried not to react the way I know Kyle wants me to when he says the things he says. I try to laugh it off or even play along. I think it's working and Kyle is being friendlier, however, he's started to text me a lot. Starting at the beginning of summer, when I left for an internship. Usually just normal conversations but he has started to text me more in the past few weeks. He's begun saying things like that he thinks I'm cute and he likes the way I do my hair, etc. He even gets a bit clingy when I don't respond quickly enough. I've told Dean a few of these things (I never accused Kyle of flirting with me, just told Dean some of the things Kyle said) and Dean is so thrilled that Kyle and I are getting along that he fails to see any issue. 


It's worth noting that I've not seen either of these guys in person since summer began (when the texting also started) as I have an internship seven hours away from school.

In any case, we kept hanging out, and eventually it led to us mutually asking each other out. Eventually we lost our virginity to each other, which fwiw was really really awkward. We kept dating and eventually we were spending every day together. We'd do everything together. I'd always make dinner {Despite my crap cooking} but she'd eat it and say it was nice.

Let me start by saying this won't happen until after grad season, so if it happens, not until July. 


I've been dating my boyfriend since November of 2013. He's my first, and I'm his first real girlfriend. We live in small towns, with ~100 people in grades K-12. For the first 8 months, everything was grand. We were both happier together then we were apart, we were comfortable together, blah blah blah. We were the cute couple; everyone was happy for us, we were cute in public, but never affectionate in public. That's just weird. 


After 8 months, things just started going... Wrong. I started seeing flaws and I got less and less happy. He has ADD, ADHD, and is a compulsive liar. He's had extreme anger issues since he was a little kid. And I mean extreme. The first two were always kept under control by medication. The lying never stopped though. I guess I thought it was cute at the start, to have someone lie to try to impress me. He's such a bad liar, everyone knows when he's lying. His school is a lot less mature than my school, so there's always been a maturity gap between us, but more so now that I've completed my first year of university and he's still in grade 12. 


I find myself trying to change him now. Asking him for little things, like to stop biting his fork or chew with his mouth closed. Big things, like to act more mature or to quit lying or quit chewing tobacco. At some point I got sick of asking and outright told him to start listening to me or else we're over. He hasn't done one thing I've asked him to do for the past year and a half. That's my problem, he doesn't listen to me. Sometimes I think he just keeps me around for the sex. *It doesn't matter what she says, we're still having sex.* Especially after he admitted to me that he only started dating me and kept me for the first four months for sex. I was a kissless virgin before him, I don't know what he thought he would get from me. I talked about that with him, and he got mad at me. If you think I just keep you around for sex and that's how you feel then just get out.


He's not all to blame; his parents are awful at parenting him. Bribing him to do things, letting things slide, never being strict. They let him use their truck, pay for tires for him to burn out and rip up. They let him get overweight. They let him chew. They told him that if he quit chewing, they'd pay for me to go on the family vacation to Mexico. He didn't quit. 


Something major happened on Tuesday. His parents own a gas station, and he's always taken bags of chips or tins from it without paying. He works there, so little things don't bother his parents too much. But Saturday night, he took $150 worth of fishing and camping gear, plus gas on top of that. It's not the first time. His parents got fed up with it and packed a bag for him. If you want to stay here then stop stealing. He took that as get the fuck out of our house. As soon as they started parenting the hard way, he decided that it was too much for him and it was time to end his life (by cutting his wrists, of all ways). I got his side and their side of the story. They would love for him to live with them, but he's dying to get away. I tried helping him. I bluntly told him that he was the cause of all his problems, and this is all he has to do to fix it. He said he needed to do things himself. He's always been overly dramatic. Eventually he came to realize I was right and he wanted help, but I was done at that point. I told him that if he wasn't going to bother listening to me or valuing what I say then he shouldn't talk to me at all. I asked for a week without him. Not breaking up, not free to mingle with others. Just a week without having to worry about how he was doing. 


That was Tuesday night. Friday night I sent him a list of 30 things to do to fix his weight, his health, his relationship with his parents, and his relationship with me. (I have the list still if it would help to see it.) I told him that I wanted to see progress by this Tuesday night. 


Tuesday is coming up fast. I'm his grad escort so I can't break up with him before that, plus we're both going to another grad party under the same person. If he's not better by Tuesday then I'll break up with him in July. 


What I need to know is how to break up with him without killing him. Some major things I want to bring up is the lack of respect he has for me, his stuff, his parents and their stuff, and himself. I want to bring up how he doesn't listen. I know I shouldn't have to change him, so I want to say something like you'll find someone who won't have to change you, and will love you for who you are but that just sounds corny. He's too immature for me. I just don't think we're right for each other. 


Another pretty selfish thing I don't know about because this is my first break up... Can I ask for my gifts back? I got him a $150 Nixon and $90 Turtle Beach headphones. I'd love to have those headphones for myself, and to make a little money off the Nixon, seeing as I don't have too much. 
I GET IT I CANT HAVE THEM BACK. OK.

From the moment I met her on our first date, it was an instant connection. I've been on plenty of dates and had an average number of long relationships, so I knew right away this was different. The first date lasted 6 hours and we both agreed it was the best date we'd ever had.


Things began to progress over the 2 months and we were seeing each other multiple times a week, going on fun and romantic dates that were better than any either had ever been on. We both opened up and were more vulnerable than we'd ever been in any other relationship. She told me I was the sweetest, most honest and genuine person she'd ever met. I felt the exact same about her. It was going perfectly and I for once in my life, saw a future with someone I knew I could spend a long time with. Until last week, when I ask her to be exclusive.


She tells me she absolutely wants to, and she's told her friends and family all about me and they're so happy she's found someone perfect for her; the exact opposite of her ex. However apparently she and the ex were only 99% broken up and she said she needed to officially end a relationship with a guy who she hadn't seen for at least 3 months as he's in a completely different city. She promised we'd be official very soon but he was avoiding her because he knew she wanted to end it.


This wasn't ideal but didn't raise concern for me, as I saw no reason to believe they had any relationship whatsoever. After a week of us texting and e-mailing, she's excited to spend the long weekend with me and going to meet part of my family. The ex never introduced her to his family in 2 years of dating and as she described,  he's very immature and not ready for a serious relationship, unlike you.


Everything is perfect, until she calls at midnight this morning and simply says this is the hardest thing she's ever had to do, but she can't see me anymore because there are still feelings for the ex. I'm just speechless and it felt like I was punched in the gut.

My boyfriend ended his nine-year marriage in December 2013. We met the following summer, and began dating in September 2014. I want to preface this by saying that I've been in several LTRs, including a few long-distance, and am generally very cautious about romantic decisions, sometimes to my detriment, so I'm hoping to get some perspective here.

The obvious first: we're absolutely fucking crazy about each other, and I've never felt more strongly about anyone in my life. My closest friends comment often that they've never seen me like this—I'm generally snarky and definitely don't have much patience for sentimentality, but with him I feel deeply connected. I gush about him—God help me, Reddit, I'm doing it now—and he admits to doing the same about me. We share a sense of humor, analytic minds, and passions for language; we have similar views on politics, religion, finances, kids; we communicate well and, though we both love to debate, actual fights are uncommon. We respect one another. The sex is off the charts. We talk well and often, and both of us work hard to correct behavior/patterns on the rare occasion that the other expresses concern.

Ending a marriage is hard, though, and we've both felt the emotional fallout. He no longer has feelings for his ex-wife (he'd asked her for the divorce, after which she moved across the country, and their only communication, which he tells me about, is dry, minimal, and usually about finances), but he feels guilty about the pain he's caused her, angry at himself, and worried that he can't trust himself to make promises (like marriage vows) and keep them. We've talked about this frequently. (I should add here that he has seen a therapist regularly since the divorce, and takes medication for depression/anxiety, both of which he is very scrupulous about, and it has seemed to help.)

In December 2014, he brought up the idea of coming home for Christmas to meet with my family. I was surprised, given the brevity of the relationship, but agreed. I told him, though, that meeting my family meant something to me—no one wants to introduce an SO to their family that they don't think will stick around. He agreed at first, then did some thinking and admitted that the gravity of visiting my family for the holidays was overwhelming when he considered it more deeply. (We both teach, so the visit would be at least a few weeks long.)

I suggested that he stay behind while I went home and use the time to consider what he wanted, and he agreed. When I returned in January, he told me he knew he wanted to be with me, apologized for the lapse, and our relationship resumed stronger than ever.

Then a few events beyond our control accelerated our relationship. In February, my landlord decided to sell the house and gave me notice. Since I live in a college town, there are few apartments available mid-semester, so my boyfriend invited me to move in with him temporarily, which I did. Things were amazing between us, and moving in together worked out more brilliantly than we had hoped—we cohabitated without any problems, communicated easily and well, and had fallen even more deeply in love. 

Then, this spring, he got an amazing job offer from a state about twelve hours away from where we live now. Think Montana to Connecticut, though those aren't the states. *(A note here about why he'd apply somewhere so far away: He currently works as a visiting professor, and that position ends soon. Academic job markets force you to look nationally for TT positions, and his field is specialized even for academia, so the possibility of any job, anywhere, is pretty remarkable.)* 

When he was interviewing there, he spoke to someone in my department and found that they were doing some hiring, and he asked me to apply when he returned. The position was, frankly, far better than the job I currently have, so I did—and I got it. We began to plan a move there together, which would have taken place in late August.

I knew things were moving quickly, and in an ideal world, obviously, I wouldn't want to pressure the relationship with this level of commitment this early. I felt (and feel) incredibly strongly about him, however, and since he was initiating these plans, I was becoming excited to take the chance. 

As they had in December, though, the impending Big Relationship Step, this time compounded with the usual stresses of a big move and a new job, started to weigh on him. In May, a week after I had accepted the new job (though, thankfully, before I'd put in my notice to my current job), he told me that the idea of my moving with him was scaring him. After a long and teary discussion, he said he thought we needed to break up so he could come to terms with the post-divorce anxieties that were causing this turbulence.

I was heartbroken, of course. I found a new apartment and declined the new position (I have no support network in that state and didn't want to move there alone). The new university encouraged me to apply next year, when they would again be hiring for a similar position. 

While I packed, searched for an apartment, and made alternate plans, I was still living with him, of course. The breakup was sad but not angry, and we still got along, so we spent a lot of time together in the final weeks. He spoke about his ex-wife a bit, but the tone was different: he never bashed her before (and still does not), but he started talking some of their incompatibilities more. He spoke about recognizing his responses as ones made in fear, and treating them as such. Our conversations about everything were still long, intimate, and incredible.

Then I left to spend some time with my family before my new lease began. and we agreed to go NC for the two weeks I was gone so we both had time to think and heal. (We would need to meet up when I returned, so I could pick up a few final items and my cat.)

Three days after I left, I got a text from him: He regrets the panicked choice he made more than anything, and wants to fix things. I called him, and he said he didn't realize until he ended things how deeply he felt about me, and how much he wanted things to work. He'd like to try a year of long-distance once he moves, with monthly visits. If that went well, next spring I could potentially reapply for the same job, as they had asked, and join him.

I don't know what to do, Reddit. A year of long-distance doesn't actually bother me—we're both very independent people who communicate in writing well (we even spent two months writing long emails to one another before we met in person, and have both admitted that we were developing feelings for one another via those letters alone). We have the money for travel, and understand the difficulties of that kind of arrangement. This emotional oscillation has been hard on me, though. I don't want to be stupid. I'm in love with him. I want to be with him more than anything. I want to feel secure and happy in my relationship. I want to move past the pain and uncertainty of the divorce. I believe he's trying to get better, and has made progress.

Help, Reddit. Can we reconcile?

I started my first job ever about 3 weeks ago. It's in a medical office and I have a pretty simple desk job with my own personal desk and space. I'm the youngest here by about 15 years and I'm also the only male in the office, aside from a doctor who comes in once a week.

My job does not require me to communicate with anyone, it's all on the computer, but I still greet all of my coworkers when I come in and I'm always open to conversation if someone else initiates. 

I put an iPhone charger in my desk space to use whenever I'm low on battery and if you know anything about apple products you'll know that these things aren't cheap, especially not for a college student who only has 1 paycheck to his name. This charger was also brand new. 

I come in to work the other day and the charger + cable are gone. I check all my drawers and cabinets and nothing. I ask my coworkers who in turn ask the rest of the staff and nobody knows anything. My desk is situated so that everyone has to walk by it to get to the front desk (many coworkers have to get there throughout the day) and this allows them to see everything in my desk. Furthermore, one coworker that I do not know who usually stays in the other office 20 min away was apparently at my office when the charger went missing and was constantly walking by my space which makes me suspicious of her (I have never met her though). Now, I'm paranoid everyday I come in of my things being stolen from me.

Furthermore, I have caught multiple coworkers rummaging through my personal desk drawers multiple times without asking me which makes me feel severely disrespected and even more paranoid of theft. I keep things in these drawers ranging from headphones to sunglasses to the occasional wallet and this is not ok. 

I'm not mean or rude to anyone so I don't think I was targeted specifically but this theft makes me feel extremely violated for some reason.

21744,Relationships,21p56b,"About 8 months ago a buddy of mine started dating this girl. Prior to this, my friend and I had this thing in which we would skype a lot and play games together when we were bored at home. We both have freelance jobs so that was a pretty normal situation. He´s a fashion (girls in lingerie) photographer and I´m a Motion Graphics Artist/Musician and now getting into programming and Gamedev. We would also go out together on weekends, with the rest of our common friends, and get wasted. Drugs and stuff.

So he meets this girl and for the first month or so he becomes kind of unavailable, which i was cool with. After a while he starts calling me again with his girl present, and slowly we started getting along, the 3 of us, and going out together. It was fun, i was happy for them.

I myself value my alone time and don´t go out too much except on weekends. Most of what i like doing i see best done by myself to get it right. I don´t go out of my way in search of company cause I´m usually cool with myself. Being this way does get me some attention from girls but I´m rarely interested and just avoid them completely since I´d rather be doing my own thing. Rather than getting in to some relationship for the wrong reasons, as i have done in the past.

Anyway, as time goes on, I become really close with this girl, and i find myself wanting to spend less time on my stuff and more with her. I find her beautiful, smart, talented (shes also a photographer), affectionate, she likes gaming, and just plain fun to be around. And we can talk effortlessly. 

On the other hand, in 7 months, they never spent a day away from each other. And i was there with them for hours a day, most days. Not always in person, though. He became exhausted, caged, bored of her, wanted to get back to fucking other girls and called her a useless retard several times a day. And he said all these thing to her with me listening. I would defend her the best i could without 

getting too involved. She has even developed an eating disorder thanks to this guy comparing her to the models he photographs and shes unhealthily skinny now. I started accentuating ugly qualities he always had, ones I knew before this girl entering the picture. A selfish, narcissistic egomaniac. A Lazy drug addict who can treat people like shit. But hey, we played games together and went out with our friends and had fun.

I found out that this girl was used to abusive relationships. Absent father figure, past coke-head violent boyfriends. She is very needy of affection which i always gave her unconditionally, always trying to put a smile on her face, but always within the margins of being her friend. Sometimes pushing it a little, but nothing off limits. She is also a very jealous person.

Things started getting weird whenever we saw each other. She would smile really hard when we met and always find a moment with me alone. Tell me that she knew she would break up with this guy someday and sit skin close to me. We would talk about private stuff, and also about how fed up we were with this guy. She would get jealous if she would see me speaking to another girl. Other friends noticed this too... And she would only flirt with me, no one else. Except her bf if he wasn´t currently treating her like shit. We were close.

My friend finally got sick of her and decided to break it off and asked me to help her out. I thought it was the healthiest thing they could do. But they were both devastated, all of the sudden neither hated the other anymore and they couldn't really let go. I got crying calls from both sides. And tried too make them both see it was for the best, it wasn't working out. But she would keep calling him saying that she loved him and wanted to kill herself. And my friend asked me to go keep on eye on her, but she wouldn't see me because she related me to him. She would however call me and cry and talk about stuff. So i stayed awake for the most part of the whole week they were apart. Sleeping 2 or 3 hours a day just in case she needed someone to talk to, so as to prevent her from hurting herself. She ended up getting back in touch with her own friends and family who she was avoiding. And as soon as my friend saw her get a little bit over him, he went back to her. And i got really pissed and told him to go fuck himself for asking me to go through and destroying her so that so he could take a week off without really solving any of his own issues, just to avoid the pain of a breakup.

I got even closer to her in that week, and made plans to help her work on herself and get out of the hole she was in, but when they got together i was exhausted and backed off a few days. She called me and said she was worried about me, thanked me and said she owed a lot to me for getting a hold of her shit, and that she hadn't met someone like me in a long time.

A day later she called me asking if i wanted to get together, to which i replied that i didn't think it was a good idea, me being pissed of at this guy. She said that she was still really hurt and that she wasn't really in love with him anymore, just obsessed. He was already treating her like shit again. She wanted me to pick her up after college and go do stuff alone without him. I told her to wait till stuff calmed down a bit, but ended up agreeing to go out with them together next weekend since they were still trying to make it work.

So we got together at his place with some other friends, he treated her like shit, i treated her well, she complained to me about what an asshole he was. And started sending some strong signals. Smell me, touch my leg, we would look really deep into each others eyes and smile. But then they got high on mdma and all of the sudden they were over each other right next to me.

Right then i was so confused and in pain that i decided to back off for good. And it hurt like hell. So i myself took some mdma, alcohol, some lsd and had the shittiest trip of my life. I went back home and cried my ass off and didn't sleep for 2 days.

Then she called and asked what was with me the other day and that she too had been crying. I couldn't handle it anymore and confessed i was feeling really strong stuff for her, crying like a pathetic baby and saying all sort of dark shit i convinced myself of during the trip which wasn't even true. She went mute, said she didn't know what to tell me, that i got confused. That i should go out more and meet more girls. Get some rest.  I said i was sorry for the mess, i called him told him what i had done and said i was sorry, all though i wasn't really. The only thing i´m sorry for is how it came out and pretending to still be this douchbag´s friend. I blew it.

A couple days later i sent her a text so as to avoid further awkwardness, explain that my feelings for her were true, but to discard all the other dark shit i blurted out. And that if she was ever in need she could count on me. She replied the same as before, + that I shouldn't get so worked up about it, and that we would obviously see each other again. I'm not so sure of that, it pains me too much in the current context and even if it changes i know it would be really weird to be her friend again. I like her too much. We haven't spoken in a week. And now he is going to therapy and they're trying to make it work by seeing each other less. I have no idea how that is working for them, nor if i was played like a buffoon and she has no feelings of the sort for me. Or if she really likes me and i freaked out and scared her off. Or bad timing. Or I´m just a friend too her, but why the other signals then?

I can´t stop crying. I have never fallen so bad for someone in my life, and i miss her really bad. All i can say is that I am done with drugs for good. I want to get back to my stuff but i don't have the strength or motivation, i can´t concentrate on anything else, i´m a zombie. I need to know whats on her mind but she wont say anything and I wont pressure an answer.

I have no idea how to proceed from here. Do i continue to not speak to her? Do i avoid meeting her and his bf? Do you think she was really into me or did i interpret everything the wrong way?

I've been with my boyfriend since I was 14 and he was 12. We were together for 7 years, he broke up with me for a year and 2 months for another girl, then he came back to me when it didn't work out. Being young, and him being my first and only love, I accepted him back immediately. It's been over 2 years since that incident and I have this constant lingering need to want to venture out of my relationship. We are each other's first, and like I said, I've never had another boyfriend.

He is a great guy. He's in the military and does what he can to take care of me the way a bf should. But honestly, I want to get out and experiment a bit more, although I really don't want to lose him. I already understand I can't have everything I want. He's just as in love with me as he was before, but I'm not completely sure if it's because when he tried to find someone new, it was a disaster, so he came back to me since we never really had any problems with each other to begin with (His mom was the reason we initially broke up. She was being a complete bitch and saying all kinds of things to him to get him to leave me).

During the time we were apart, I felt lost. I was completely, insanely, in love with him and I didn't understand why things happened the way they did. Then as time went on, I guess I started to slowly drift from the feelings I had before. Fast forward to NOW, and we are still together, and he is in love with me, and I don't know how I feel anymore.

I feel terrible. He's got a lot on his plate already. He's dealing with depression after losing the person who was a father figure to him, his mom has cancer and may only have months to a year to live, he has bills, his job, school, he's 'trying' to stop smoking, and then there's me. Oh, and I forgot to mention, we have a military ball we're going to in a few days.

It's hard for me to be completely supportive because I am so bitter towards his mom for the way she treated me then, and attempts to treat me now. I'm passive-aggressive about it, but I honestly don't give a shit about her after she emotionally fucked me up. I just get frustrated, and he has to deal with it, when I know inside it's because I kind of want to just escape. It doesn't help that my bf talks about marriage and I'm no where near ready for that.

Lately, I found out a friend of mine likes me. He is quite different from my bf, but something about him gets me. We both have the same personality types (INFP), and he's very sweet. He's also never had a girlfriend before. I really do like him, in the way where I can't get him out of my head and I look forward to his text messages more than my BF's. The other guy knows I also like him, but I feel so stuck. I feel if I were to end things it would be such terrible timing.

About a month in a half ago, I actually did ask for a break (before I knew the other guy liked me), but it lasted a day. He kept crying and said he'd let me go, then turned around and said he'd wait for me and so on... 

I really don't know what to do.

I think at our core we were best friends over the span of the relationship, we went trough a lot togheter, grew up and supported each other no matter what.



Our relationship is not without faults, the 2 main events that stick out in my mind are:


 when she lied to me for 1 year (she was smoking behind my back and she knew i hated smoking but hid it well, we dont live togheter so i only found out by accident)



and when she dumped me out of the blue because she wanted to move to another country but after being separated for ~1 month we got back togheter because she realised the relationship was more important than moving. (the reason she wanted to move is because she thought this other country would have better working oportunities)



Some other stuff i want to say: she is an important person to me and i care for her a lot, only wish her the best and making her happy makes me happy.






Over the past 3 months i switched jobs (career advancement, better job at a different company) and i reconnected with a girl i used to go to college with. 




Me and this girl had a bit of history, in the month i got dumped by my gf we were both drunked at a party and hooked up, then had sex again a week later but we stoped there, never got closer romantically, it was just sex




So we start hanging out (we work in different departments, we only meet if we set up a morning coffee or lunch break, else we allmost never see eachother) and start reminiscing about the old days, start getting to know eachother, start getting closer.




We develop a strong connection pretty fast, the chemistry is there, we both like eachother physically (i knew this from the time we hooked up) but it turns out we both really like eachothers personality also. 



Meeting her at work or after work is allways a blast and we enjoy eachothers company a lot, so much that i start wondering if we should be togheter.




It feels like i never had such strong feelings for anyone before, i know what a crush and if that is an empty feeling in the stomach, this is like a punch in the gut.




The thing is i dont know if a long term relationship could work because we are both strong determined focused people who also have a strong wild side that we tend to hide.




I dont know what to do, i want to wait it out to see if these feelings pass but for the last month they keep getting stronger and stronger. I dont want to do anything to hurt my girlfriend and currently im just friends with this girl at work i never crossed any line but these feelings are difficult to deal with.



Im sorry for the wall of text or for my bad english, hope i can get the point of view of people who maybe experienced something like this. Thank you

I could tell he was pissed but I didn't say anything cause a friend was over. That night I could hear his phone going off a lot really late but didn't say anything cause he was already in a bad mood. So I just ignored it.

The next morning I just felt like something was not right. I know I shouldn't have (curiosity killed the cat) but I looked at his phone while he was asleep. I found out that he had deleted his incoming messages but not outgoing. All of the outgoing ones were to a girl he's been online friends with for years but never met. 

So I see these texts saying things like she's the perfect woman, they're perfect for each other, I don't know my faults, and even some sexual suggestions. I don't know how she responded because her messages were gone but it seemed like maybe she was telling him to back off because one of the last texts from him was that they would just keep on being perfect for each other but best friends.

17369,Relationships,2ag0ya,"My boyfriend and I are in love. We live together and share our lives with each other. We plan on getting married and having a baby or two once we own a home and grow a little older. I can not and do not want to imagine growing old with anyone else, we have a very happy relationship.

My one and only complaint for the love of my life is that he happens to be pretty selfish in bed. I'll give you a brief rundown of our every sexual encounter: 
1. He must always initiate, every time I initiate I get a 'maybe later' 
2. He pulls his pants down and asks me to caress/massage his manly bits/groin area (which I oblige to, because otherwise no sex)
3. He turns on some porn (I don't mind this, but it has gotten excessive) 
4. Once aroused, has me S his D (I enjoy this part)
5. Once more aroused we have sex

Now to be far, we do have a lot of sex. Probably 1.5 times a day on average. So part of me feels like I can't complain because we do it so often, I should feel lucky. However, my love never goes down on me, never touches my lady parts, never seems interested in pleasuring me beyond his own pleasure. He also makes it obvious that he doesn't like eating me out or fingering me when I do beg him. This makes it impossible for me to enjoy, and I end up pushing him away feeling uncomfortable and embarrassed. 

I'm just offended. A little back ground info, I am sexually attracted to females, and have had many sexual encounters with the ladies. I've done my fair share of eating out, and I know my vagina looks and taste like a vagina should. I am a healthy weight and have good hygiene. I know not everyone is into vaginas as much as I am, but I mean, its really not that hard to reciprocate every once in a while. 

We've talked about it and he just gets quiet and looks sad and apologizes. It honestly just makes me really sad. I love being eaten out and having someone genuinely want to make me orgasm, but I guess I'll have to let that go. We've had a threesome, initiated by me. It was the last time a person other than me made me cum :( I often fantasize about other people pleasuring me. I would never cheat, but I do think about other people very often. 

I've considered refusing him blow jobs and other sexual attention to make it fair, but if I did that, I'm confident our sex life would dwindle to zero. If that happened, I don't know what I would do :( So reddit, I leave it to you. How do I address this with my SO in a non-confrontational way where both parties end up happy?

20202,Non-Romantic,2udqzp,"Note that my parents are Asian and very conservative of the Asian cultures and lifestyle, whereas I have a more integrated Asian-American point of view, but still have a decent adherence to Asian lifestyles. 

A little bit of a background, my family has been in America for 10+ years and we completely love it here. As I (currently) continue/ing my education in college, my English is to a high degree but my Chinese hasn't been doing well although I can still speak it decently (read &amp; write pretty okay-ish). On the other hand, my parents' English aren't doing so well aka broke English. Therefore they cannot understand deep conversations. This language barrier from both of us has been affecting me ever since high school when I was a sophomore or junior when I realized that I don't spend as much time as when I was young having long detailed conversations with my parents. These days, hanging out with my parents meant eating in silent together or briefly talking about school and our jobs. 

Not only with the language barrier from both me and my parents but it's also about the close-mindedness of my parents, my mom in particular. Recently, my eyesight has been deteriorating (never had glasses/contacts before) and in need of glasses because my vision has been blurry to a point where it gives me a constant headache trying to strain my eyes to see in lecture halls and scared to drive at night. When telling my parents about my plan to go to the optometrist to get glasses, they argued as to why I didn't take good care of my eyes earlier when I was young like turning on all lights when studying and not reading under the sun or in the dark, and so forth (thinking that I can just reverse back in time). I was upset as to the fact that they didn't want to pay (maybe a money issue too?) for my glasses, or my well-being in general, and if they had to pay, I had to pay them back (as well as tuition for college). Birth control is another topic [since I am sexually active &amp; have acne-prone skin (main reason that perhaps BC can regulate my acne)]: my mom chastise me for going out of the norm and doing something that is harmful to irregulate my hormones and menstruation. Believe that white devil's drugs are taboo and that Chinese herbal (and perhaps natural) medicine is the best ideology. 

Also my mom believe that I have intercourse with all the guy friends that I hang out with (trust issue might be another problem here) and thus instigate me (who I'm hanging out with, where have I met him/her, how long have I met him/her, where are we going, if I'm seeing or talking to this friend) whenever I tell my mom that I am hanging out with a friend (even girls). And last, my parents have been involved in my last relationship and indirectly cause my previous relationship to a [breakup](http://redd.it/2qilyn) that made a pretty big dent on the mother and daughter relationship. 

How do I sit them down and talk about this problem that I have been having for several years? My friend suggested getting a Chinese translator to translate what I'm saying to my parents [I understand Chinese well but not the other way around (me expressing my feelings in Chinese)]. Do I just need to set a boundary with my parents and hoping this can ease out in the future? Or am I just being childish, selfish, and uncaring that I'm not able to see from my parents' point of view? 

TL;DR: Language barrier causes a rift between me and my parents to communicate the problems that has been bothering me for years. The traditional and close-mindedness trait that resides in my parents is not wavering and it's causing a big stress on me. What should I do to lower this stress?

I've been with him for about 1.5 years now, and this hasn't been as much of a problem until recently, when our living situation has slightly changed. We aren't living alone and there is now nearly no time in which we would be home alone. This, I know, gives him little time to pleasure himself.  
We have sex every few days, sometimes every day, sometimes just once a week. It very much depends on circumstances. Of course, this also lessened, because we are now hardly ever at home alone and I just can't have sex if I know someone is just a room away.  
This living situation is not permanent and should be resolved in half a year.  
I have talked with him about how bad it makes me feel to see him casually browsing for porn, he said it was an old habit from being single for almost all his life and that he would stop. I accepted the explanation and was glad that he would be willing to change his habits for me. We agreed that it would still be totally okay for him to wank, even when I sit right next to him (because honestly, I think it is pretty hot to see him masturbate), but not just to casually browse for porn. I also felt a bit bad, because I normally wouldn’t want a partner to change to make me happy.  
As you might have guessed, he hasn't actually stopped. He is now trying to be sneaky, which he isn't. This hurts me even more, because I now get the feeling he his hiding stuff from me. I caught him twice now, and he is always sort of sorry. The last time I caught him he actually got really depressed and stayed in a terrible mood for the day.

We've severely grown apart. Our tastes, past times, and future goals are dramatically different, now, and it really bothers me. Worse is that I feel sexually repressed for committing to a LTR at 16, and she thinks everything is just fine. Our sex life is not at all how I would like it, and despite communicating this on a number of occasions, she seems oblivious as to how much this matters to me. It makes me feel unattractive.

I like going out to bars and partying. She doesn't drink, and prefers private getaways and outdoor stuff. I'm not so much in to it, but I've definitely made an effort to go do the things she wants to do. She almost never goes out with me, which is awkward when I show up dateless to parties, where all of my friends have their significant others. In fact, I almost always have a better time when she is away, because if she is with me, I almost always feel like I'm being judged for drinking or smoking, or dancing... It's awful.

However, two problems came up only a couple or so months ago which led to fighting a lot, and everything I said was called stupid or boring. We had a short time of sexual problems that he blamed on me making him too satisfied and it was too easy to get.

The two problems are/were:

1. He won't talk about his feelings with me. I understand he is reserved but some of them affect his behavior. the sexual problems were on his side (meaning he started only being concerned with his pleasure) and it turned out he was feeling bored and that he needed variety and/or a short break. But he never  told me that or even hinted at it, he just sort of checked out in that aspect. Even the fighting was partly due to his inability to share his emotions. He didn't tell me this till I told him I can't take the meanness and fighting but he was feeling extremely guilty about something to do with me (unnecessarily it turned out) but he refused to share it. He told his friends and asked them about it but wouldn't talk with me. I could have told him myself there wasn't much to feel guilty about. 

2. He can't take criticism. A lot of the fights started from this. I was careful to criticize only the behavior and make sure to do it gently. For example, telling him that it wasn't nice to keep saying everything I would talk about was stupid and boring and then complain that I wouldn't say much anymore. Instead he would find a way to blame me for what I was trying to talk about or tell me not to start fights, or he'd just play the victim card, saying that i was just calling him names (I didn't) or being mean. 

How do I help him stop these behaviors? The first one was there for awhile but the second (not taking criticism) is more recent. Am I doing something without knowing it to cause either or both of them?

September rolled around and I was beginning to pick up the pieces of my life but I always missed him. I even got into another relationship (that didn't last either) and still missed him...

He never explicitly stated he didn't want to talk but not responding at all was obvious enough.

I wanted to know why he just up and left me like that. I wanted him to see how great I've been doing. So I rushed on over to chill. It was awkward, but we caught up a little and he finally told me why he ended things...Because he got freaked out by me bringing up his ex girlfriend. She hurt him a lot and apparently it's just not a subject to bring up. I still don't know how someone could feel it necessary to break up with someone they really care about over arguments about an ex but I didn't get into it.

Nothing big there, we use each other's computers all the time. He has a million things open on his desktop, including iTunes, Spotify, and his text messages. (We both have Macs.)  

So as I'm browsing the internet or whatever I'm doing, I hear the little *tink* of text messages coming in and I see that they're from his ex. He is at work at this time; he works a second-shift position. A bit of backstory: she and I used to be friends, but are no longer because she dated him, basically. They still talk as friends, but I and all of my friends don't trust her because we know she still has feelings for my boyfriend.  

She made these feelings pretty plain to him in text messages that he shared with me over the weekend, and we both agreed that she obviously didn't want to be his friend.

The text messages are (obviously) not text messages that they should be sending to one another: she mentions her need for oral sex, he mentions he wonders if she still tastes the same, etc., she mentions that he should come over and rectify her situation.  

They both go silent for a while until it's his time to leave work. I've texted him a couple of times at this point, but nothing to indicate that I knew what he might be doing. Around the time he would normally be home, he texts her that he's outside her house, and despite other texts, I don't hear from him until he comes home about two hours later.  

I ask him where he's been and he does mention that he went to her house, but that he also got drinks after work. I decide not to say anything about it as I'm not a confrontational person, so we shower and go to bed.  

This morning, I'm up early because I can't get it off of my mind and I don't want to confront him, but I NEED to confront him, so I wait for him to wake up and I tell him point blank that I was using his computer and I saw the messages come through.  

He looks at me like he was waiting for it. You want to know if I did? He asks me. I nod. He says yes. I ask why. He essentially says that he wanted one last hurrah before settling in with me for good. We are weeks away from signing the lease to the loft of our dreams.  

I managed to not collapse into a ball of tears in front of him because I am angry. VERY angry. We have married and non-married friends in similar relationships to ours, and none of them have ever wanted 'one last hurrah'. He apologized. I told him that it was time to break off contact with her, and he agreed, even as he realizes that it will be difficult to prove to me.  

I'm not ready to forgive him yet, but this goes against every fiber in my body. I've never been angry with him for longer than a day, but he's never done anything this bad before. This is the first time he's cheated on me, and my trust is betrayed. I'm hurt (duh). I want to rage and storm at him, I have so many more questions to ask him now that I've had time to clear my head a bit, but because of our schedules, I won't really see him or have time for that until tomorrow night.

13022,Non-Romantic,30108i,"Hi Reddit,

Here is the situation. Two men in my friends group are in a fight. It has divided my friend group pretty much in half as people have chosen sides. One of the men (Todd) threw a brick through the other's (Alan's) window. Alan stole some property out of Todd's storage unit. Todd has been putting up ads saying Alan's business is now closed when it is still open. etc. etc. They are both playing dirty. 


What disturbs me now is that they are getting other people involved. Todd came across naked pictures of Alan's sister. Todd is now threatening to print the pictures and post them all over the front of Alan's shop for his whole family and all the customers to see. The thing is, Todd is keeping the pictures a secret to use as his secret weapon if Alan does anything else.


I am not involved in this fight. I have stayed out of it from the beginning. But I think it is crossing a line by getting other people involved in their pettiness. And ultimately I feel like Alan's sister's reputation will suffer more as a consequence for these guys' actions and that's not really fair. I am a friendly-acquaintance of Alan's sister and have her as a friend on Facebook. Should I alert Alan's sister and let her know about the pictures? Should I tell her who has them or tell her to be careful? Or should I just stay out of it?

So sometimes she hangs out with them after work till late and then stays at her parents.  That's all great.  I just want to know after work whether or not she's coming home or hanging out and whether or not she's staying at her parents.  Mostly want to know if she's OK and whether I should make more or less food (if I am cooking) or make small surprises for her.

8462,Breakups,3dvuhq,"TLDR Basically, I am not sure if there is a chance of winning back my ex boyfriend or if he is just playing a push/pull power game with me. He doesn't want me to move on and yet he doesn't want to get back together.


My ex boyfriend (24/male) and I (27/female) broke up 6 1/2 months ago. We dated for 5 months only so both of us should be over it by now, but alas, we are not. The relationship was incredibly intense and amazing. The connection we had was  definitely very special. I fell madly in love with him.


I broke up in the worst way possible with him, over the phone, due to paranoia on my part, a misunderstanding and a serious error in judgment. The problem was that he wasn't as open as I would have liked. I noticed that he wouldn't open up to me and started hiding things from me, which drove me crazy and made me paranoid. I made a serious error in judgement, accused him of something he most likely didn't do and impulsively broke up with him over the phone. At first I was convinced that I was doing the right thing, but since he seemed so upset I slowly started to believe him that he was telling the truth and in fact didn't do the thing I thought he did. So i started to have regrets and realized I shouldn't have broken up especially not over the phone. Sorry for being so vague, it's complicated. It comes down to trust and him possibly having lied to me. I thought he hid some pretty serious things from me. This is not about jealousy or another girl. By the time I realized that I had probably made a serious error in judgement, it seemed to be too late. At first, he was begging me not to break up with him, but a few weeks later when I finally came to my senses and realized that I had most likely simply been paranoid and that I should have trusted him, he wanted to have nothing to do with me anymore. I apologized several times and tried to win him back, but it didn't work and he cut me out of his life, which hurt me tremendously. I'm obsessed with winning him back and don't know how to let go and get over him.

Just to give a bit more information: Six months later, since I couldn't forget about him and still wanted him back, I asked him if we could meet. He agreed, but told me that he'd just be doing me a favour and that he doesn't really care whether or not we meet up at this point. I felt rejected, assumed that he'd moved on and since it seemed to me that he really  wasn't interested in me anymore, I decided to forget about the meeting and started dating another guy.  I'd been single for the past six months wallowing in self pity and being heartbroken so I figured I should force myself to like another guy. I've been dating him for the past two weeks, but can't forget about my ex. When my ex found out that I'm dating someone new, he freaked out, confessed that he still loves me and that he never got over me. When I asked him if he wants me to break up with my new boyfriend so he and I can be together, he pulled away  again, told me that he couldn't take the risk of me not trusting him and stopped talking to me.

Is this a hopeless situation? Should I really and finally give up on him or should I break up with my new boyfriend and try to win back my ex? If so what would be the best strategy? How can I convince him that I would trust him now? And is this really about trust for him anyway? I'm confused. Perhaps he only wants me when I stop chasing him.

9346,Relationships,1ny95b,"I am going to get right to the point. Last summer, I met my sort of ex, G, on OKCupid. He messaged me and I liked him right away and really wanted to pursue a relationship. We went on a few dates, I lost my virginity to him, and then we went our separate ways for college promising to keep in contact with one another. With him, I was so depressed, he almost never contacted me and when we did text or chat, he would be very distant and then end the conversation by simply not responding. I always feared that he was sleeping with another woman and every time I tried to make plans to see him when I was in town, he would cancel them so I never saw him whenever I went home. He eventually dumped me over FB and said that he wanted to get back together eventually and I believed him. Of course I now know it's not true. A couple months ago, I deleted him off Facebook, mostly because he was posting some awful stuff about rape and I saw just how much of a misogynist he is which, being a feminist, doesn't fly with me. 


About a month and a half after that breakup, I started talking to my current boyfriend, Y, over Facebook. A friend suggested we friend each other and talk, therefore we had not met in person before talking. I soon realized that he is everything I ever wanted. He is so smart, has similar interests, makes me feel wanted and loved. Y is more than I could ever imagine, we have talked everyday since the day we first started talking online. We talked for two months before meeting in person and have been in a relationship for 7 months and we are currently in a LDR for awhile but we are making it work. 

The problem is, I still think about G often. It's so bizarre though, I don't love him, I don't even like him, he made me so upset all the time, he was the worst sexual partner I ever had (and Y is the best), everything about G says that he is not someone I should be concerned about but I still think about him often. I recently went down to his campus (to visit a close friend of mine who also goes there) and I had these high hopes that I'd run into him. I kept telling myself that because I look very different then when we were seeing each other (I am thinner and have longer hair), I want him to make him realize that he fucked up or that he would want sex so I could reject him. I don't want to cheat on my current boyfriend, I'd never think of doing such a thing. I just keep thinking about this awful person I used to be with.

It's a long soap opera... but I live a silver spoon of a life and love my parents. My Mother [52 f] is the spiritual and caring house wife and never flinched in her relationship with my Dad. 

5 years ago, I went on a trip to London with my Father. Giving only the bare necessities, my Dad stupidly decided to ditch me from a festival we were at to get with a women he'd been talking to for the past 2 days (who I found out he knew for some time prior). I felt weird the whole time. Got a 'sense' that something was wrong. When his work pals pawned his absence off on childish excuses I rushed back to the hotel. Found him mid-action. I'll say to you what I said to my Mom after she found out I witnessed this: It did not scar me in any unimaginable way, I did not walk away with PTSD or anything like that. I don't need a counselor to walk me through steps of grief. I dealt with that all on my own. I talked with him right after (she packed up and left while I went the restroom--only thing I could think to do) and he was so stupidly apologetic. 

My dad is a powerful businessman. One does not get to where he is without being strategic and intelligent--which is why such a stupid move seemed so out of place. The first thing I did was address how much of a mistake this was. The second was to immediately forgive him and tell him I'm more concerned for him and Mom. I yelled at him and told him to not mess up a good thing and that I would not tell Mom. He seemed mad at me for this. He was angry that I wasn't going to punish him. I didn't really get it at the time. I was selfish, I wanted my life to go back the way it was. I basically got my wish.

Fast forward to this last December, my Dad says he's going to lunch with a work buddy and that he'd be back late. My Aunt gave my Mother a text saying she'd seen my Dad with another women walking out of a swanky hotel downtown. I used to think my Mom was really bitchy. Always up my Dad's ass, not letting him breathe on the small things. I always thought it crazy that they were together... but it all started to make sense. The reason my Mom's first thought was to jump to cheating was for more past incidents. She immediately confronted him. He confessed on the spot. He'd been leading a relationship on and off again for 3 years with another married women [unknown age, my guess is younger than him by 10 years]. He confessed to London ... and then I found out he cheated on her a full decade and change prior right when my baby brother was born. 

My world view of him was broken after London. I thanked him, silently. I needed a kick in the ass. I needed to see my hero fall. But, this? This was hard. It was like watching a cripple get pushed down and, when you try to pick him up, you find out he's been pretending this whole time for attention. 

My Dad lied to me. He made a promise to me in London that this would never happen again. I made an assumption to myself that it hadn't ever happened before due to how sloppy this was. I was so hurt to be wrong. But, I didn't need anyone. I just got my first major job, I just got out of college, I'm moving, my best friend's been 6 feet under 1 year June 3rd, KIA in Enduring Freedom, and I've got a longtime girlfriend I intended to engage in the next few months. With all these distractions, I just wanted to be there for them when they needed me. My mom would talk to me once a day, hysterical. She begged me for a negative opinion of my Dad. But I can't. He has been everything I needed--mostly lately.

Growing up he played the fatherly role that was hands off. Supplied everything necessary and played the role. He was an excellent Dad unless you wanted to throw the ball or learn small niche things. I know he knew this. He would try to make up for it a lot. But, nobody like's being smothered. Instead of a steady stream of 'Dad'. I would get a condensed 1 weekend a month smothering of him teaching me how to change oil, throw a ball, ride a bike etc. Then work would call. He worked 80 hours a week etc. Fast forward to my last 5 years. I've been running through a rough time in school and motivation to wake up for the day. He pushed me, kicking and screaming, through it. He did an amazing job and I've him to thank for my new life outlook. At this pinnacle time of validation for my upbringing, I was being asked to smear him by the victim, my Mother.

I wanted to side with her, but I felt compelled to take a neutral stance. She would wimper that she did everything she could, she told him she loved him every day, etc. I believe her, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he's human. I don't penalize the man for wanting something/someone else. I penalize him for tearing someone apart and taking the cowards way out by cheating.

When my Dad talks to me, he tears up every time. He's so sorry I had to see that. He's sorry for what he's done to this family. He wants it back so desperately. He wants to be punished. He gets mad when I downplay it (what am I supposed to do? It's not like I'm saying It's okay but when he's balling in my shoulder saying I screwed up I just sorta say Yeah. You did, but you gotta pick yourself up man.). He makes it sound like I'm giving him a pass, but, I'm not. It's just, I don't know what punishment he needs/wants. Or, more importantly, what I can give. I feel like, since I sat on this for 5 years, that I don't have a right to be mad at him. I gave that up. That was the price I paid the devil to make all of this go away in the short term.

On top of all this, I'm one of 3. My sister is older and knows. I spoke with her and my Mom passively accuses me of desensitizing her. I talked logically to her about how we need to handle this, and she's been less irrational about her anger. My Mom needed someone to scream and yell at with. I took that away from her. If there is any sorrow that I feel, it is this. My brother is 7 years younger, just graduated High School and has a full ride to College... he doesn't know a thing right now. 

Day to day, my Dad's texts make me cringe. He tiptoes between trying to get back to normal with me (huge baseball fan and we used to talk every day about it; also sends me life/job advice and we discuss deeply about work philosophy) and embarrassingly apologetic. We used to go to a baseball game 2-3 times a season. I've been to a dozen so far this season. It's the same feeling I got when I was younger and he smothered me once a weekend. I know he sees his time running out as my Mom is moving ever closer to an obvious decision. So, he's trying to milk the time. But, every time I get with him alone, it comes back up. I can't enjoy it, I can't ignore it for an hour. Not that I think I should. I, just, I want my freaking Dad. I want him back so bad...

...Now comes Father's Day. I get along with him just fine, topically. Like, we have dinner once a week as a family and such, I have a beer with him and laugh about the baseball team. My question, outside of how to deal with him day to day, is what I should do/get him for Father's day and how should I treat it? I feel like this is his last as a 'whole' family (I know that's only literally true). I know my Mom will put on a good face and let us do what we want etc. but what sends him the message of Hey, I love you, I'm here for you, and though I don't agree with what you did; can't walk with you as you go through this; can't understand why you did it, I will always be on the other side of this as your Son and friend. I always got him shit gifts (or chipped in on gifts my Mom bought for him--though I doubt that's happening this year) for Father's day and just played golf. Should I just ignore everything and do the same as every year? Should I do something special? Does he deserve it? Would I be humiliating my Mother by even doing something at all?

Thank you for reading the whole thing.

In December she decided to leave her he-never-tried/distant boyfriend for me. Ever since then we've been dating fine. We went on vacation together, we went on countless dates with each other, and the bedroom is all good. 

About a month ago she left her job and hasn't been the same with me. She was more distant, less talkative, less excited to go in the bedroom. On my birthday which was 3 weeks ago she seemed perfectly normal again and like nothing was wrong and then the next day went to being distant again. 

On our six month I wrote her a long loving message telling her how I love every minute yada yada yada and I got no response back. I went to her house before work and she seemed cold and I finally called her out. She said she didn't know who she was and she wasn't sure if she jumped into this relationship. Keep in mind she left him for me and I told her lets take time before it gets to serious. I asked how does this effect us and she said I don't know. Every question I asked she responded with I don't know. 

The day after she told me she wants and wants to work on us so I agreed. The only problem is I feel she's not trying. When I talk to her I barely get a response and when I do it's I don't know and okay.

The problem is I really care for her but it's killing me being treated like this because I'm trying so hard and I feel like I'm getting nothing in return.

So my boyfriend of 1 3/4 years is really dedicated to a particular sport that is really dependent on weather conditions. It's pretty much a day time only thing and I really feel like I try to be sensitive to the fact he doesn't always like to make commitments for things on the weekend as it might be his only chance to get in a session that week. 

With that said I rarely ask him to make plans with me during the daytime. I think the last time I asked him to keep the day open was....5ish weeks ago. 
However, he hasn't actually gotten in any great session in the past month since the weather hasn't been conducive. Not that's he's made any day time plans with me during that time (except maybe 1-2 because he couldn't go for other reasons anyways), he still goes out there and hangs out all day *hoping* it [weather] will pick up. So even though he hasn't actually gotten in many great sessions lately, we still haven't spend that time together. 

So my family is going to this amusement park this weekend because we can get in for free. There's enough tickets for everyone and for me to bring a +1 (obviously hoping for it to be him.) I asked if he wanted to go and he asked if he could get back with me on it. I said okay, but please let me know soon because if he can't go, I'd like to bring a friend that I know would have a blast. 

So he responds with the following: 
I think it would be fun to check it out with you. I have a proposal: hypothetically, if saturday is an amazing [weather] day and Sunday won't have any good [weather] (meaning it would be about a month or so without [sport] then I would ask you if [friend] is free and you can bring him. If he isn't, I would still happily go. Does this sound fair? 


.....I get it. I get if that day happened to be an amazing weather day it would be a great opportunity. But it really sucks that once in a blue moon I can't even get an solid yes or no from him because something better might pop up. It's also embarrassing to constantly have to tell my family he's not showing up or even worse *might* come. 

So am I being unreasonable or is he not being very considerate?


TL;DR Boyfriend can't commit to plans due to hobby and I'm feeling like a second choice.

26201,Dating,23jxb4,"First of all, I have evidence that she's real/legit. We did a short video call, something that she generally doesn't like as she told me right after. I'm telling you that because you would say that it's catfishing after you know that I met her like a month ago on the internet. We've been messaging each other like daily and we get along with each other very well.

The only problem is that she doesn't want to date yet but rather would like to do so in 2-3 months when the summer holidays begin. I told her that I would really like to see her, like really much and that only messaging for a long time isn't the best thing. Though, the next day I told her that I accept what she said and that I'm fine with it as long as we can phone, so it's not all about messaging. She lives like 40km away from me and often seems to be next to her parents when she's not outside or has to work for school.

Also, the reason why she doesn't want to date yet is that she feels unsure or unsafe, I don't know. She says that she wants to see me too but she also told me that she might've never met someone through the internet to then 'date' in real life right after.

So... What can I do? Is it normal that she wants to date in 2-3 months? She is a very friendly girl and on one side I can understand her but on the other side it makes it hard for me not to see her.

Just something as a sidenote, could you guess why she told me that I could get a new hairstyle/cut my hair by a bit and shave my beard so you could see my face better? She told me that in a very friendly way though because she told me that she likes my picture. I have to agree with her though, I should've shaved my beard which I usually do but since we have these 2 weeks of holidays and I didn't plan on doing much, I just didn't care for it. The beard looks organized, it just looks like a bit too much and my hair looked a bit unkempt on the picture although I know a lot about hairstyle. But anyway, why would a 'normal' girl say that or is that a sign of interest?

Today I also sent her pictures of Berlin because I told her I would since she told me what places are nice here. She said 'Beatiful pictures you did there' and I said 'Thanks a lot, beauty'. She said 'You always with your 'Beauty' :P'. 
Me: Not always :) But no problem :)
Her: But more often :)
Me: And only for you hehe

I hope that came over well haha because I did this some times already. She's just really beatiful and I'm like stunned whenever I see a new picture of her.

Anyway, thanks a lot for reading.

A bit of background: we met online when I was in high school, and we both were dating other people when we met. We broke it off with those other people around the same time so that we could be with each other. I live in the US and he lives in the UK; it's a fairly long distance, but so far, we've made it work.

We recently saw each other over Christmas and I went home around New Years. Since I've been home, we seem to have broken off and become fairly distant from each other. I was very busy for about a week after I came home, and we didn't get much chance to talk. 

When we finally did get to have a real conversation with each other over Skype, he seemed very out of it, and distant, as though he felt uncomfortable saying what was on his mind.

It just kept getting worse from there, and it continued until I had to hear from a friend that my SO had to go to the hospital due to alcohol poisoning. Apparently he had gotten sickly drunk and had begun smashing things in the house. I was so worried about him that I couldn't sleep, and so of course, I had to bring up the uncomfortable subject with him when he came home.

We had a very long conversation, during which he told me that he was feeling severely depressed and even numb. He told me that he wasn't feeling emotions properly; that he remembered what it was like to feel madly in love, joyous, and excited about life, but that was all they were: memories. All he has felt for the past few weeks (and even before that, when we were physically together), he said, is numbness, anger, and occasional sadness. 

He is seeking professional help for his anger issues, but I don't know if he is willing to admit to a professional that he needs help dealing with the rest. 

Since this talk (about a week ago), we have not spoken a word to each other, though we have exchanged a few messages. This is not like us at all. Usually, we talk about our own lives frequently.

 I don't know what to do to help him. Do I leave him alone? Do I keep asking him if he's ok and if he'd like to talk? Do I talk to his friends? I'm swimming in dark waters and I have no idea how to handle this situation.

21870,Non-Romantic,34d6pe,"My father and I were never best friends, my parents split when I was 4 and I was shuttled between their houses every weekend my whole life. Eventually my dad married my step mom, a horrible woman I have never gotten along with, and moved 45 minutes away for them to raise her horses on a farm.
By the time I was 17, I knew to hide certain parts of my life from my dad, he was slightly conservative but after marrying my stepmom got far worse and much more judge mental. I couldn't tell him about my gay friends, any parties, or basically anything about my day to day life without upsetting him. Then one day I get wind of the fact that he found my myspace page, or what I suspect is more likely, his assistant found it and showed him. He saw and read some things he did not agree with and we got into a very, very nasty fight via email. We each said some regrettable things, a few below the belt punches, and stopped talking. My family pressured me to apologize and call him but I never could. It sounds stupid, starting from MySpace, but we said some really terrible things to each other. 
A few years pass, and I decide to try and work it out, I email an apology, and he emails a barrage of insults and back handed compliments wrapped in guilt. 
This happens two more times before I give up, that was at least 5 years ago. Today, my brother is working for our dad at my dads painting company, and for weeks we have been hearing how insufferable my dads been as a boss and what a jackass he's been. But tonight, I got a call from my brother informing me that the current job has bankrupt dad, he's in debt up to his eyeballs, the business is dead as of Friday and has mentioned to my brother suicidal thoughts. All of this on top of the fact that he's going through with a divorce from my stepmom.
My brother pressured me into calling him, saying I may regret it if he's gone soon or I will miss out on things. I'm not sure how I feel. On one hand, I made peace with never having a relationship with my dad years ago, but on the other I feel guilty and terrible for his problems and for not being there for him. I don't know what good, if any, a phone call from me would do. Yes I'm his daughter and I feel an obligation to him, but I also just keep thinking of the last time(s) I apologized. My father is not a kind man, my whole life he harped on me being overweight and nit picking anything he could think of about me. He is downright frightening when angry, and I really don't want to hear what choice words he would have over my tattoos. 

I feel like a bad person for not wanting to call him. I want to have family members from his side get involved, get his brother and sister over to possibly help in some way, especially considering I have no finances to help him in any way.

590,Relationships,332lww,"My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. We like the same things and we're kind to each other, and we have so much fun together when we hang out, whether we're at a concert or curled up in flannel pyjamas and playing video games. We actually have more sex now than we did when we started dating. He's very kind to me, and has never called me a bad name or tried to hurt my feelings during a fight.

We made the decision to move in together in December, and now we're finally going to do it, after a lot of planning and deliberation (I've never lived on my own before, he has and does currently). He's very excited, and keeps on talking about all the great things we can do with the place and how lovely it will be to have each other around all the time.

I agree with him! I'm really excited as well. I love him, and I feel ready to live away from my parents. That said, I'm a little bit nervous, and not just because I think I'll miss them. They've been my primary support through my struggles with mental illness, and are pretty much the reason I'm alive today (and not just because they're my literal parents, hypothetical smart ass). 

I have bipolar type 2 disorder and general anxiety disorder (GAD), and my life since reaching adolescence has been pretty hectic. I've been in and out of hospitals for a good chunk of my life for various stupid decisions resulting from my bipolar. Even worse, I've yet to try a bipolar medication with benefits that outweigh its detrimental side effects (I'm very very unlucky). I have anti anxiety medication (Valium) and medical marijuana which I smoke to quiet some of the insanity if I'm experiencing hypomania or just having a tough time with anxiety. I also see a therapist weekly and attend weekly group dialectic behavioural therapy sessions.

Essentially I'm doing the best I can to keep everything under wraps, but bipolar isn't something that I can just control, as much as I like to think I can. It's debilitating and disrupts every aspect of my life, and living with me isn't easy. My boyfriend has seen me have panic attacks and extreme bipolar episodes on either side of the spectrum, and he's found it very disturbing and stressful. That's not to say that he isn't understanding; he does a great job of being understanding, but it's obvious that it shakes him up, and he's told me himself that it's sort of surreal to see me like that. 

Because of all this, I'm getting very very paranoid that things are going to go wrong. I've been internalizing my insanity with more effort than I've ever used before, which has been working with my boyfriend but has slipped out at home. I frequently have episodes of panic or racing, nonsensical paranoid thoughts bordering on delusions about my boyfriend realizing how awful I am to be with and leaving me. This has been a huge source of stress for me for the past month.

On top of all that, I'm going to be living in my own place for the first time in under 2 weeks! Holy fucking shit! I'd need advice even if I weren't a crazy person.

I wasn't the only one, these two I'm talking about were there at the same time. They're a couple, a couple of jerks. The girl paints, models for photography, and does porn. The guy is a dancer, stripper, front-man type. I wouldn't judge but they both have serious attitude problems and they hate me. I am a painter, I also write music, play guitar and sing in my rock band. Maybe they resent me because I've never been raped and I've never had sex for money. I feel for them, but I need to know how to deal with them. 

When we first met we got along fine, but I soon found out they hate everybody. They talk about people behind their backs and they're always so nasty about everything. As roommates it was difficult to live together, and the only time we could work together was if there was a crowd they had to pander to. There were a few blow outs between us, and the guy is especially abusive. He would try to say every mean thing he possibly could to tear a person down, and she would support him. I don't like conflict it makes me sick, but they always found a reason to be mean to me. For example, I labeled my food so no one would take it, and they got mad at me for expecting no one to take my food. I was called every name in the book. The abuse was over the top and would take a whole post just to describe. I've gotten frustrated with them before and told them off, but it didn't make a dent and didn't matter. There was never any respect just bad attitude. How am I supposed to respect someone who's constantly mean to me?

14279,Breakups,1jafch,"Throwaway AND not a native speaker, this should be good :)

In february I've met this great girl, the chemistry was pretty obvious, so we started dating. Sex was awesome, we also started bonding more and more. Exclusivity wasn’t discussed, so we both seen some other people, it was kind of a fwb relationship.

As time went on we both developed feelings for each other. The turning point was in the middle of may when her friend whom she had sexual history announced he's coming for a visit next month.

I didn't actually flip shit, but it did put us in an awkward position. After thinking I said something along the lines of… if this guy comes, there is no chance for something serious between us, at the same time there is also no point in keeping it casual as we developed feelings for each other. I gave her a choice, we completely stop everything or she shuts down this friend (the problem was that he already bought tickets). I left that evening thinking it's over but she actually immediately told the guy not to come. We kept seeing each other and in about a week we started a relationship.

We were together each and every day for a month, which we also both agreed it's a bad idea…but we did it anyway and it's been great.
I must say at this point that she kept saying that she's bad at relationships, as it can't last more than 2 years… so I've been like WTF… I don't want a relationship that doesn't even have some potential.
 So we were discussing it thoroughly. It soon became clear that she has intimacy issues, she's afraid to commit. I'm guessing she's afraid of yet another disappointment (she had a pretty sad childhood and some bad breakups and also history of depression, eating disorder…), so like more she opens up the bigger the disappointment, which is unavoidable in her mind, gets.

So ok, after a month some friends from her country visit her, although we still see each other we do not have any privacy… I'm not saying take a whole day, but I did say that I missed at least drinking a beverage or taking a short walk just the two of us – this was one week after her friends came and we didn’t have even a minute just between the two of us. Well she didn’t take it well and sad she’s not sure if we even work together and that maybe we should break up.

So me, trying to understand, considering the fact that she does love me tried to logically get to the source of the problem, psychoanalyzing her. Last two weeks consisted of us getting back together and breaking up for a total of four times. It's like multiple personality disorder... one wants to be with me and the other doesn't.

 I know… just get the hell out of there right? Of course, but I do care a lot and I’m just thinking how messed it is.

It’s as though the more she loves me, more eager she is trying to get away – not risking the “unavoidable” disappointment.

So I’m like… you don’t like me no more? Fine goodbye… You found someone else? Fine goodbye… Any legitimate reason? Fine goodbye… but bloody hell, she’s actually saying she doesn’t want to be together because she cares too much.

As I said … I care about her, a lot. I would to love to try fixing this problem and at least try the relationship… I mean when we’re good we’re amazing. Even if we don’t get to stay together I would like to help her overcome these fears and barriers of hers.

Extra information, she keeps contact with almost every ex of hers and some if not most of them are still in love with her… She’s saying they are her friends and that’s not going to change… I told her I don’t have any desire of becoming a member of this fan club.

I’m not asking you to tell me to break up with her, we are already broken up.. I’m just wondering how I might help her regardless of our potential future together if she actually overcame her problems?

 You see when we fight, he likes to talk a LOT, doesn't know how to listen. Kind of like a person who keeps on thinking what he's about to say, and when I respond to him, he is ready for a comeback to whatever I said. 

 And now the problem with me is that when I reach a boiling point, I let out everything I want to say, and then stay quiet for the rest of the conversation.

This becomes difficult though as he works a four on, four off shift pattern. That leaves us with a limited amount of time through the week we can see each other. The problem is, his housemate, lets call him Jay, works 8-5 every day, leaving on Fridays to drive back to where they come from to go home and stay with his girlfriend [21F] only to then return Sunday night. That means the time they spend together is very limited, but me working weekends means I can't utilise the time Jay isn't there and can only visit on weekdays. I feel even worse when my S/O stays at my place and I know Jay is by himself that night. It must be grim to work all day to come home to an empty house and just go to bed. I feel much like i'm intruding sometimes when I come around and I really hope that Jay doesn't begin to resent me as if I am taking my S/O away from him. I don't want to get in the way or be stuck in the middle of them, he only has a few hours a week after work to hang and I feel like i'm taking that away But if I don't come round whilst Jay is there, i'd never get to see my S/O. Usually we end up watching TV and Jay resides to bed early but my S/O assured me that he does tend to say goodnight pretty early anyway due to work in the morning. It still doesn't help my guilt to feel like i'm third wheeling, or that Jay might feel like he's third wheeling with us.
The problem is, Jay's girlfriend, as far as i'm aware, stayed quite often back before I was in the scene and this called a little bit of third wheeling jealousy of my S/O, so I feel like maybe he is using me or inviting me around when they're supposed to be chilling together to in a way get back at Jay for the times the roles were reversed. 

No idea what i'm supposed to do really. Can't make this guilty feeling go away even though i've been told so frequently that it's not a worry.

1785,Non-Romantic,3dn94m,"**Context:**

I live in one of the top 5 worst rental markets in the USA. There are very few available rentals, and the rent $ is super high and hard to find something affordable.

And I have an old dog, and almost nowhere will rent to you with a dog. It took me months to find this new place.


**Background:**

I really liked my FORMER shared house a lot, but there was 1 problem housemate. I shared a wall with him and he would randomly play loud video games until 3 am, because he was unemployed while I had to be up in the morning for work. I had to share a bathroom with him and clean so much of his skid marks off the toilet seat and pee off the floor. He was rude and constantly found fault with me for things like: how I boiled water, and what heat setting I used on my laundry (seriously). Whenever I would try to discuss an issue with him, he would get SUPER defensive, and days later he would look for something to critique me on such as how I boil water.

Finally after *months* of searching, I found another shared house that I could afford, that would accept my dog.


**Current situation:**

This house is out in the country. The owner (Abraham) lives there and he is 70 years old. He and his wife and child live in a suite attached to the main house. His wife and child are Thai and both super quiet, sweet and shy.

My room is on the bottom floor and 2 other renters are on top. They are a student (Cora) and a middle aged man (Joe).

It's a gorgeous cabin-style country house that the owner built himself from wood he chopped down himself.

I went to see the house twice before I moved in, and I met everyone but Joe. Cora also seemed quiet and shy and everyone was really nice. The house was super peaceful and quiet. It seemed perfect. 


**The problem:**

I'm a nurse who works 3 overnight shifts in a row (72 hour shift) so I'm not home at all Monday - Wednesday. Then I get to rest for the remainder of the week.

I got back to the house on Thursday morning to BLASTING hard rock music coming from Joe's room which is above mine. (Not DIRECTLY above but close). 

Thrashing guitars, loud screechy screaming, thumping bass. 

The sound penetrated every part of the house, there was nowhere in the house I could go without hearing this music. 

*I think that because of how the house was constructed, cabin style with wood plank floors etc, sound just carries everywhere*

I did my best to ignore it but music like that makes me extremely tense and stressed out. Even though I was extremely tired and stressed from work and really needed to relax, I decided to go do my errands and hopefully he would be done playing his music by the time I got back.

I came back at 4 PM and he was blasting it the same as ever. I decided I should try to just deal with it. 

Then, without turning off his music, he came downstairs and turned on the TV in the living room, right next to my room, and began watching that. So I was getting his hard rock music from above and the loud chatter of TV noise from right next to me.

He stopped watching the TV after an hour and turned down his music to a somewhat quieter level after 10 pm, but I could still hear it from my room.

At 11 pm, I could not take it any more, I was exhausted, and I called my friend and asked her if I could spend the night at her place.

I came back the next morning (Friday) and he was no longer playing hard rock. Now he was playing the most horrid early 2000's pop music. Like, just imagine the most obnoxious pop bands of that time and that's what it was. 

I'm listening to this from inside my own room with the door shut and the window shut.

Saturday was even worse than either of the previous days, I guess because it was a weekend and people let loose on the weekends. 

Fortunately, that evening I was leaving for a camping trip so I was gone for the weekend and could rest and enjoy the quiet.

*On Sunday night when I returned it was the same, again, and this time I was going to have to go into my 72 hour shift the next day.*

Finally at 10 pm, I went to talk to Joe. I explained the situation and he said he would turn the music down.

He did but I could still faintly hear screaming and thrashing guitar in the background as I was trying to get to sleep. I actually started crying in bed because I was worried about not being able to get to sleep and having to go into my 72 hours shift while sleep deprived and stressed.


**My issue:**

I don't know what to do about this for a bunch of reasons.

1. Joe has rented a room in that house for 5 years, whereas I have only lived there for a few weeks. I feel really rude about being that person who comes into someone's home where they have lived for 5 years and telling them I want them to radically change their lifestyle just because it bothers me.

2. I have some mild sensory issues and can't stand to have anything in/on my ears, otherwise earplugs would be a good solution. 

3. I believe that it might not matter how quietly Joe plays his music because of how sound carries. He would have to play it at least 1/10th as loud as before, or I will still be able to hear it. At night, since we're out in the country and everything else is very quiet, if he plays it AT ALL, I will hear it. When I'm in my room with the door shut, I really don't want to hear his music at all for more than an hour or two. A short period would be fine but not for entire days and not late at night either.

4. I can tell that Joe has special needs but I'm not sure what they are. My guess is that he is autistic / on the spectrum. I'm an Aspie myself although I'm pretty close to mainstream. But somehow I've always had problems communicating with others that are on the spectrum. I am shy and timid so sometimes I don't make myself blunt and clear enough and they don't understand what I'm getting at. But then other times I try to be more clear (while still polite and kind) and they have gotten SUPER UPSET and hurt and mad at me. There's a stereotype that people who are on the spectrum don't get their feelings hurt by blunter truths, but that hasn't been the case at all in my experience. So there's that as an issue too. 

5. I'm not sure if Joe is employed since he was there all day Thursday and Friday, and he was up so late on all the nights I was there. (Also the two times I saw the house in the beginning before I met him, he was there, but he was sleeping, and it was in the middle of the day). So he may be there hanging out at the house 24/7.

6. I can still move back into my previous house, as they aren't going to rent it out for at least 2 more weeks. So I have two weeks to decide whether this is a livable situation for me. As bad as my previous situation was, I know most people wouldn't think this problem is as big of a deal. However this kind of noise (music and TV) is actually a worse issue for me. I didn't realize it was until I was in this situation.

30691,Infidelity,1zdv1c,"So my boyfriend of 3+ years found out I cheated on him.
Right around midnight Friday morning I woke up to a phone being thrown at me and a lot of yelling. It took me a couple seconds to figure out what had happened. Then it occurred to me that I had some incriminating texts on my phone.


Now my SO- We'll call him John- was always a good boyfriend to me on paper. He was essentially what most girls would be in to. I noticed over time though that something between us didn't spark quite right. He seemed to be more in love with me than I with him. Don't get me wrong, he was my best friend and I really did love him. I just wasn't as passionate about our relationship. I made numerous attempts in the past to try and shed light to my feelings, but could never find the right words to say and I wound up succumbed to a desperate plea from John saying no one could ever love me like he did. And at the time, I believed 2 things 1) No one would ever be as dedicated as John 2) Maybe I couldn't feel love like other people.
I decided to cheat thinking it could relieve some of the tension. After all, I still wanted to stay with John I just didn't know how cope with our one-way spark. In turn, I started projecting all of the things I wanted to change about John onto a coworker.


What started as a hookup gradually evolved into a regular occurrence. I KNEW that if I didn't break things off with John, he would eventually find out. It's inevitable for a relationship. I felt trapped by this mess. I wanted to stop hooking up with my coworker but I couldn't stand up to it and say no. No matter how many times i told myself This is toxic, this can NEVER happen again. I lacked the strength to turn him down. I also discovered I couldn't stand up to John and do the right thing. I only tried to mask the horrible person I was hiding. Needless to say karma caught up to me.



So here I am, two days later, wondering to myself how the fuck did I become this person? And where did I start to lose my sense of right and wrong? I was never this cold-blooded girl before.


Thinking about the anguish that John is feeling right now is unbearable to me. The fact that he gave 100% to making us work, all the sweet gestures over time, his tenacity to stay with me forever... I can't understand why I was unhappy with him. And I can't believe what a monster I have become. I may have ruined a man completely.



I haven't talked to John since the incident. I have been trying to clear my mind by staying busy but every time the thought comes up, I can feel my heart breaking for John. It's only deepened knowing that he's done nothing wrong, and he's forced to deal with this pain now.



I guess my question is how is someone supposed to cope with this? My head is spinning so badly from a reality shock that I can't think straight. I tried to figure out exactly why I did what I did by writing a letter. I haven't given it to him yet and I'm still not sure if I should...

And how he doesn't have much to live for/how single he is/alone/suicidal. 

After awhile I would keep reassuring him that things will get better and his life will turn out great. He always stopped messaging me after that. 

We stopped being friends on Snapchat/fb/Instagram/etc due to we just didn't talk long and I was still in love. He told me he loved me and wanted to be with me but felt he would hurt me and then we talked about getting back together which resulted in me waiting a month with no reply and he never brought it up so I assumed no. 

Before we unfriended eachother on social media anytime I posted I was happy, he would message me something sad or so, then one day he unfollowed me from Instagram and I posted how my crush liked me and I guess he was stalking and told me congrats on your crush liking you, I don't care who it is honestly but I'm happy for you, blah blah I'm so fucking single and alone. And I asked him how he found out turns out he was looking at my account, and saw it. The next day hes dating this (15F). So I told him how I was happy for him, and look how he's not alone he just ignored my comment. 

I saw him buying a candy cane for her, and he was all smiley and happy but then he saw me and he just looked so sad and turned away and stared into what seem like bleak nothingness as I passed by, we ended up talking and he told me how he can't like that he still loves me but feels pretty much moved on and how he won't bother me anymore. I wish him the best, and say I still feel the same but glad I won't be hoping anymore.

 A couple days later I delete his number and he messages me saying hope you have a great day, when did you start working, etc which surprised me. Because he said he would stop bothering me and he just confuses me because moving on to me means no longer having feelings for the other person for being affected by them. Whenever he's with his gf he's a bit happy but sometimes he looks sad (at least that's what his friends say.) He gets more sad seeing me, especially when I'm smiling.

Basically i'm 24/F and struggling to come to terms with my parent's separation which happened about two and a half years ago. I have one brother [22] and we all happily lived together in a lovely family home. Very comfortable and happy home life and never wanted for anything. 


At 21 my mum [53] told me that she wanted to leave my dad [51] and that she was looking for somewhere to live as she wanted some time on her own. My brother was away at University at this point so I was left at home to deal with the slow and sad breakdown of my parent's marriage. It understandably took its toll and I made the decision to move across the country to work and lived and worked in a travelling circus for the next two years. I purposefully removed myself from my home situation, creating myself a new family environment in the process and then followed it up with travelling across Thailand on my own to give myself some head space and independence. 


 Fast forward and I'm now in a happy and stable relationship of 10 months with my loving and caring BF [24] who I've known since I was 16. I'm living back nearer home and have a more regular job with a generous income. I'm very happy in my situation but I'm finding now that because I'm living a more routine life I have more time to address the family issues that I've tried to repress for the past 2+ years. 


I was asked to come home for my grandma's 80th birthday recently and was reluctant to attend purely because it was one of the first big family parties that my dad wouldn't be attending. My BF was unable to come with me off I went on my own to face my fears. I found the day quite difficult and made the decision to remove myself from the situation, and instead chose to wash dishes and clear up throughout the day. Eventually I ended up crying on my own upstairs until my mum found me. I felt extremely guilty as I know she still feels like she split the family up so I don't like to cry in front of her. We ended up sobbing together and it was simultaneously both a relief yet extremely upsetting. I told her how understanding my BF is with me but that I don't want to constantly dump all my emotion and feelings on him when it's not his responsibility to fix everything. 


I'm just scared now that I've opened a can of worms in that I've started to unearth all these deep rooted feelings but now don't know how to properly address them. All I want is for my parents,my bother and I to sit down and openly express our worries, concerns and feelings but I'm just so scared that it will end in tears.

2711,Relationships,24l2we,"My boyfriend and I have known each other for roughly half a year, dating for 2 months. It took us a while to make it official, mainly because I wasn't really ready for a relationship, nor did I feel comfortable with his jealous/somewhat possessive nature. I have a lot of guy friends, which has been a problem for him since day 1. He claims they all want to sleep with me, and in all honesty- I doubt many of them would refuse. This, however, has never bothered me at all, as I'm not romantically interested in any of them. I would never consider doing anything with them of that nature.

Now there's this friend I have who lives in a neighbouring country. We met online a few years ago through mutual friends. He and I somehow became close, and there was a time we talked through Skype pretty much daily. Those mutual friends we had always told me they thought he was interested in me, but I never really believed them. My friend also denied these accusations. He and I met up twice, spending a few days roaming around the capitals of our countries. We didn't stay somewhere together, in case you're wondering.

All was good, nothing romantic happened. We did hold hands. I know that sounds weird, but it just seemed normal at the time. He's more like a brotherly figure to me. Anyway, fast forward- our contact became less ever since the last time I saw him in person. There wasn't really a specific reason for it, we just grew apart a little, and I didn't have that much time to be on Skype.

So, recently... we started talking again. I tell him about my boyfriend, he's happy for me, even though he doesn't agree with some aspects of the relationship. He then tells me that he quit school and is about to join the army. I'm obviously a little shocked, but supportive. He told me that he still had some spare time left, and that he would like to visit me. It'll take him some hours to get here by car, but he says it's cool.

Obviously, I'd like to see him. I haven't seen him since last summer, so I was quite enthusiastic. Unfortunately, he'll have no other place to stay than with me. He said he'd like to stay for about 2 days, but I know that my boyfriend will never allow another guy to stay with me. I don't even feel like asking, because I know he'll flip out. Some friends recommended to just not tell him, but I don't think that's a good idea. I do love my boyfriend, and I'm convinced my friend won't try anything weird, but I'm not really sure what to do here.

Should I tell my friend he can't visit, or should I ask my boyfriend and probably get into an yet another (we argue a lot) argument over it? Is there even a good way to ask him this?

About a month after she moved away she got pregnant from some older guy, late 20s I think. I was broken and stopped talking to her for about a year.

Well, on my birthday she starts talking to me through Facebook and we catch up a little. The messages turn into texts and calls about the good days before she moved away and how she misses me and everything.

I've really matured since I last saw her 2-3 years ago and have no hard feelings but I also don't love her like I did in high school because I've met many other girls and experienced more. I told her this early before we started talking more that I don't want any relationships I'm just looking to have fun and enjoy life and if she still wanted to talk to me she can. She didn't take it too well, but the next day she seemed to get over it and decided I was still worth talking to I guess.

I am her first lesbian relationship after she realized she needed to stop forcing herself into the stereotypical relationships with men when she was not attracted to men. This is not my first relationship with a woman. We are in love with each other and every other thing about our relationship is rock solid and they make me so happy!

Essentially, at its core, my concern with this relationship is her sever lack of self-esteem towards herself in intimate moments. We are pretty open with each other and have talked about this issue quite a few times. However it is in my nature to be a very questioning person and to ask a butt-load of questions that sometimes drives her (and others) up a wall. 

I have to remind myself every single time she shuts me down (which is less now that I've mostly stopped trying to initiate things) that it's not personal. I mean yes, it is because of something I am directly doing in that moment, but it's not really about me. It's about an issue she has that is lingering from her past and is giving her anxieties about something no longer there. 

We almost had pity sex one night during the lowest point of all of this (right before we started talking) when I was having a major sulk fest in the living room while she worked at her computer. But damn that just…make my heart drop into such a place I felt like throwing up. 

Also, she has seen a therapist before and says it helped her. She was SO much worse off before she started seeing this woman. Unfortunately, the sessions came to an end due to monetary concerns. But my girlfriend has insisted she is better now than before and that she hopes to revisit the therapist in a few months. 

She's told me some of her issues: [and I can quote her]
I have anxiety about it especially when I know it's coming.
I always saw sex as some type of job before you.
I don't want to spend hours trying to rev up [foreplay]
I feel like I have to hide. [she has scars]



Can you recommend some things I can work on as well as maybe some things we can work on together? Or other things I should be asking her that maybe I am not? Does anyone else have over-whelming anxiety towards being intimate with the person you're dating/etc? I'm really just looking for help from other people's personal stories. Have you been the person in the relationship with a low sex drive? What are the top reasons why you hold yourself back from sex?

I can't believe you just said that. It's been 3 months.

Ouch.

I excused myself, went to the bathroom to pull myself together. When I came out he hugged me, apologized for being an asshole with what he said, and explained that he's got very strong feelings for me but he's just not there yet. I'm not upset about not hearing it back, I see in his eyes how strongly he feels for me. What gets me is that it was a complete surprise to him to hear that. He was legitimately shocked. It kind of hurts that it hadn't even crossed his mind yet. Is that looking too far into it?

5927,Relationships,36cos7,"Well, for some background, I've been friends with this girl for some years now, maybe 5 or so. She has always been kinda weird, and for 2 years or so now she has closed herself down to a hikikimori kind of lifestyle. She still gets out of her home and so on, but doesn't study, work, and don't really have many friends to hang out with it seems. We used to share many circle of friends but nowadays it seems I'm the one that keeps in touch with her. She's going to start fixing it and finish her secondary education starting next September tho.


I tried to declare myself to her various times, but always got rejected, because she never saw me that way. Nowadays when thinking critically I think we wouldn't stand a serious relationship because of her (and my) emotional issues, but physically I've always found her attractive, and she's the girl I've fantasized most about.


Yesterday we started talking about sex openly, and we seem to share a lot of kinks and things we wanna try. I've only had one sex partner she has had 2 or 3. I ended up offering her a friends with benefits kind of situation, as I've been kinda desperate for sex the last year, I want more experience before meeting a serious partner, and she seems to want to experiment as well.


She's really tempted to do it because of the experimenting bit, and share the experience. The only problems she seems to have is she's being paranoid that might hurt/break our friendship, and that she hasn't really felt horny since the last month, and is afraid I might not get her excited. She has had times with really high libido, but it seems now she doesn't really feel the need.

We're meeting this Thursday (after 1 year of not seeing eachother) basically to talk it out a bit more, and find a spot where we can make out and feel her body up (literally told her that's what we're going to do and she agreed), to see if she is able to get horny with me.

So, any tips for this kind of situation? I personally really want it to work out, as I think a regular sex partner would help me focus in other parts of my life, and well, I've always wanted to do it with her, but also want experience for my next serious relationship. But we've never been in this kind of situation, and I don't want it to ultimately break our friendship, as she's afraid of.


Also, any tips so I can make sure to get her hot and going Thursday? It would be really depressing if she ends up being an unbreakable statue lol.

7423,Relationships,2v9tsi,"I dated a man a while ago whom I loved deeply, despite his issues with insecurity, past alcoholism, and depression. We dated for approximately 8-9 months. Granted, I was not an ideal girlfriend and, although he would often compare me favorably to his ex, I really was paranoid, overly focused on his past, and had a number of unresolved issues that I have since come to terms with. At the time, I could not have sex due to medical issues and that aspect of the relationship became a clusterfuck due to my relative inability to deal with that aspect of my life and more than complete ignorance on the part of the doctors I was then seeing. While the relationship started out wonderfully, a growing resistance to closeness on his part and my own insecurities, as well as outside circumstances contributed to it not working out. 


Currently, I have new doctors and a new lease on life (albeit with some difficulties) and a man whom I really care for, who treats me better than I even feel I deserve. We have not been together long, so are still in the honeymoon phase, and are only 4 months in. I do not, in any way, want to be with this ex. I loved him, I loved his family, and I did hope to end up with him, but I've kind of seen the light. 

However, he got back with the woman he dated before me not long after we split and it really gave my confidence a blow. He often said terrible, cruel things about his ex, validating these statements with experiences that made me feel he ought to have taken legal action against her. I was ridiculously insecure about his past relationship for a number of reasons that I will never disclose due to the fact that it's not my story to share-though I told him he should speak with her if he felt they had issues to resolve, that I would help him through that resolution, and that I was ok with that as long as he was upfront with me about it.

His ex (whom he stated to be extremely manipulative) emailed me before he and I split, though I did not get the email until after he ended things. (She found me via a complex web of social media and email directories, which thoroughly creeped me out.) She stated how they had been texting, how wrong they were for each other, how she felt strong disapproval at how he was treating me, and how she hoped I would consider speaking with him, as we were fighting at the time. Since I got the email after the break-up, I sent her a kind and vague response. I did not tell her the awful things he said about her and claimed he had told me very little, as I wanted to be kind to someone I didn't know-it seemed unnecessary to say hurtful things to a stranger. At the time, I thought it might have been a good-faith effort to be kind on her part and did want to give her the benefit of the doubt. Essentially, not long after she sent this email (but long before I saw it in my inbox), he broke up with me out of the blue (again), refusing to see or speak to me. The urgency of the break-up and other information from friends leads me to believe he slept with her and ended things with me out of unhappiness with me and guilt. I know I am not a primary player in this drama. I just feel a bit bewildered as to why he would go back to her and if the complicated sex life that now characterizes my relationships will make it impossible for me to sustain a working relationship. I have a great guy now, but the other guy seemed great at the beginning too and I worry that I am the problem.

For the better part of three years I have been seeing this girl who I thought I was madly in love with. I still love her but lately I am feeling like she isn't as driven/determined as I am to accomplish her goals and this concerns me. She is still heavily dependent on her mother since she is still in school full time, and I don't blame her for it. I just find myself wanting someone further along in life and closer to where I am. Today I told her how I felt and couldn't help but feel like I destroyed her world. I didn't end it, we are still trying to figure this mess out. But I just feel like this growing divide can only get worse. Am I so wrong for wanting these things?

2770,Dating,22rxmy,"So I have been seeing this guy for a six weeks now. At the beginning everything was great, he would text me good morning and good night every day and always call and text me during the day. He got really sick and was in bed for about 2 weeks in between when we first met and now. The last weekend of March I stayed the weekend with him and cuddled in bed and watched movies with him, everything was great. 

In the past week or so though he seems to be a little distant. I don't know if it is because he is very busy because he was out of work for a week while he was sick, or if he is just losing interest. I have tried to talk to him about my feelings and all he has told me is relax. 

Last night he invited me out and we had a GREAT night but when we got back to his apartment I noticed in his kitchen there was a Benihana bag, I know, I'm crazy. But all I can think is that he was out on a date with someone else.. that is not really a place you go by yourself or out to dinner with the guys...And he also has not mentioned to me that he has been out, not that I need to know every detail of his day, he just normally mentions to me when he is having a night out, and I thought it was weird as all week he has told me he has been working.

16797,Relationships,2z5b1f,"I moved to Germany on a grant to work at a university where I met my boyfriend, who is finishing up his undergrad here. Things have been going great, not without the occasional hiccup, but I'm happy and he feels the same.


He met my parents when they visited over Christmas, though no other family members, and I have met his whole family. He is really clear that in his life he wants to get married/be in a long-term committed relationship and have kids, and we both started dating with clear expectations that this was something serious, with potential to be something even more as opposed to casual dating. 


After his degree and my contract is up, the plan is for me to try to find a job in the same city as where he will do his Masters (I already have a masters). I really like him and want to see where this relationship goes, and he has expressed that if its possible for me to move with him, that he would want me to. For me, its no problem to move, as I love traveling. 


He suggested that if we're already planning on going to the same city together, that we should just move in together. His view is that its a good chance to find out if we're really compatible, to really see if we can live and cohabit together and be happy, and it would save money and resources, all of which I agree with. 


For me though, I am more confused on my feelings. I feel a bit more traditional, in that if you're ready to move in shouldn't you be ready to get married, how long of a trial period would one need before they felt comfortable making a bigger commitment, and the more emotional and less rational reasoning of, if I do marry someone I want to start from scratch and be able to start off a marriage by mutually building a home together rather than just going back to the same old apartment after marriage. 


I discussed some of this stuff with my mom, and she gave me her full support and really likes him. Basically, the outcome of that conversation was that she likes him, would support me marrying him, and that she's confident we would be able to figure out all the details of blending different nationalities/cultures/backgrounds etc. It was very nice to have her support, but now I am realizing that I am at a stage of my life where it would be very normal/reasonable to move in with a serious partner/get married, something which I never really thought about, and now my mind is racing. 


So, I wanted to know what are some of the other considerations people weighed when deciding to/not to move in with someone. What did you discuss, how did you handle things like finances and stuff, if you did move in when did you feel it was the right time to get married or what did you learn that made you not want to live together anymore/break up. Would appreciate the chance to get a conversation started, as I want to figure out my own feelings before discussing further with my boyfriend :)

14725,Relationships,1udm8f," My relationship as of late has been awful to say the least. The main problem is a lack of communication from my boyfriend. We used to talk every day and see each other regularly, but things have changed, for reasons I'm unaware of. He rarely makes any attempts to speak to me and often times, he'll just stop replying to my messages. We sometimes go days without talking.

The funny thing is that this has happened before, and it's always gotten better. My boyfriend and I are both introverts and spend a lot of our time alone and indoors.  We've had moments in the past where we'll stop talking for days, but then we'll go back to hanging out like nothing ever happened. It's odd, I know. 

I have good reason to believe that he's depressed. After about a week of no contact, I reached out to him and and asked him if we could talk. We hung out a few days later and I made sure to ask him what was going on and where the relationship was going, and he reassured me that everything was fine. He mentioned being sick and when I asked him if I could possibly catch it through kissing him, he said not like that. I asked him to speak to his family about it, and he told me that he couldn't.  They arent a serious family according to him. This makes me think he's depressed and doesn't want to say anything.  

This was a week and a half ago. That night he told me that he missed me and that things were fine; he was spending most of his time in bed. He begged me to take him along with me to my friend's house, but I couldn't. I promised to see him later and he seemed genuinely happy to see me. He told me he loved me and wanted to continue the relationship. I thought to myself, okay, things are fine again.

Things still havent changed though. We don't talk at all. He did call me a few days ago to hang out and he spent the entire night sleeping on my lap. We seem fine when we're together, but everything is exactly the opposite when we aren't. I'm unsure how to go about fixing things.

It's been a gradual thing, but in recent months, both kids have wanted to taste some of Dad's Just Right cereal.  When I have shared with them, my wife accuses me of 'poisoning' the children.

I was naturally disturbed by this as it's quite a serious thing to say.  I asked her for clarification and she expanded and viewed anything 'processed' as poisonous.  I brought this up during some crisis counselling 3 weeks ago.  The counselor seemed a bit shocked at it but didn't pass judgement or discuss it in detail.

26665,Relationships,1qoyjc,"For background, I am an atheist and quite socially liberal. She is practicing catholic and holds certain conservative viewpoints I don't agree with. We've managed to keep our opinions in check for the most part. She goes to church on Sunday by herself and doesn't ask me to go. She doesn't bring up her religion with me. Unless she told you, you would not likely know she was an actively practicing Catholic unless you flat out asked. Our few conversations about child rearing have been tense and disagreeable, but overall our verbal arguments are few and far between (maybe 3).

I really really care about this girl. I love her to death. She's very sweet and kind. Selfless. Never done anything wrong in her life, to herself or to anyone else. She's not someone I worry about sleeping around or doing dumb shit. She's smart and has her life together. In turn, I've been completely faithful and honest with her about all aspects of my life. Always, no exceptions. 

When we met, she asked that we wait to have sex, which isn't something I was used to doing. I agreed to do so because I cared about her and saw a future with her. After three months, we started having sex, though it was infrequent, maybe a once a week for about four months. We live apart from each other so it was not always easy to see each other more times a week than that since we both work and have busy, active lives.

After a slew of summer weddings and bachelor parties, she casually made it known to me that she didn't like strip clubs. So much so, she preferred that I never went to them; she considers it cheating. Why do I need to go to a strip club when I have a girlfriend to look at? she says. First, I can count on one hand the number of strip clubs I've been to in my life, so this was a non-issue for me, but nevertheless it was one of the few things she had ever put her foot down on something in my lifestyle before.

A month after our strip club conversation, she texted me about it, saying that our discussion had led her to think about other things that she had questions about. She asked me about whether I used pornography. I was frank with her and said that I did. She asked me if there was anything she could do to make me stop using pornography. It made her feel very insecure and was not comfortable being in a relationship with someone who used pornography.

I was aghast. Now, let's get one thing straight about my pornography use. It's embarrassing to discuss in general but it's never been a problem for me. I consider myself to have a pretty high libido and regulate with a normal amount of use. I genuinely enjoy using it too. When I was single, I was watching porn maybe once a day, maybe more occasionally if I was bored at home. When she and I started dating, naturally we weren't having any sex for three months and then four months of barely any, I was still using fairly frequently. But nothing that I would consider addiction level or affecting our sex life.

So back to her question about whether there was anything she could do to make me stop using, I told her that more sex would naturally lead to less pornography. She prodded and said, what can I do to make you completely stop. I told her there wasn't anything she could do, and I couldn't promise to stop. Truth of the matter is that I don't want to stop, nor do I feel that should have to, and I'm not sure I'm capable of it. She pleaded with me and offered to take videos and pictures of herself so I could use those instead. I said that sounded nice and I would definitely use them if offered (I do find her attractive), but again, even with the personalized aides, I wouldn't promise her I'd completely stop. I said lets give the sex thing a trial run and see how it goes.

There was good news: Following our chat, we started having sex more. Almost nightly for the last month. We were enjoying our new sex life; she said she was happy that we were having more sex and expressed that she, too, was upset that we weren't having it more earlier on. She even pulled up a Groupon deal for a risque photo shoot and said that she wanted to have sexy pictures taken professionally for me. Best of all, I wasn't watching nearly as much porn. I did once last week because I was home by myself and just wanted to, but was sexually content otherwise.

Last night was the bomb drop. We were lying in my bed sleeping and she wakes me up. She said she had something on her mind. She asked me again if I had used pornography within the last month. I felt ashamed in that moment; I had once (at least once) in the last week, and I told her that yes, I had. She immediately started crying. She told me that she couldn't be with someone who looked at pictures of other women for sexual gratification as it didn't fit with her idea of monogamy i.e. I'm cheating. I apologized. She said that she wanted me to promise that I would never look at porn again or otherwise she couldn't be with me. I told her that if I promised, I wouldn't be able to keep the promise for the rest of our lives without possibly being made into a liar at some point.

She texted me this morning after she left for work and said Part of me wants you to just lie to me. We've left this conversation wide open. She's very unhappy and I'm unsure how to handle it. It's possibly ending this relationship; one where we've discussed moving in together, getting married, having children. Everything. 

Generally Reddit advice is communication, but we're communicating. Wide open communicating. We just can't agree. Is she asking too much from me? Am I being stubborn? Is pornography use in a relationship uncommon? I feel like I'm the bad guy, and I feel super guilty about having to defend pornography usage but it's part of who I am and have been since I was 12. If she was a vegetarian and 9 months into our relationship asked me to stop eating meat forever, I'd give the same response. I'd try for her, but couldn't promise that I wouldn't at some point sneak off and eat a steak somewhere, even if it is animal cruelty by her definition.

I just don't see a way out.

EDIT: I've read each and every post made, way more than I expected. Thank you for all of the attention to the matter. There are all sorts of opinions on both sides of the fence each with sound backing. 

One of the major themes is that we are simply not compatible. Her insistence on things guided by her religion, her upbringing, and her insecurities are definitely at the forefront of my mind. When I speak to her next I plan to bring this up. It needs to be addressed before we can move forward, and she needs to come to the table with a compromise on the issue of children. In that regard I have not been allowed a say in the matter.

Second, with regard to the porn issue: the people who said that I'm not being fair are right. Though I never promised anything, I messed up when she came to table with a compromise and I gave her nothing to show for it. I plan to do three things; First, I will apologize. Then, I am going to give her an HONEST good faith effort and refrain from viewing porn (with her help).

But, I will let her know that enough is enough; she doesn't have free reign to dictate how I spend my personal time. It's not about the porn really at all, though I do enjoy it. It's about being forbidden to watch it at the root of the problem. Because it isn't about me; it's her insecurities, her rules, that I need to adjust my life to accommodate.

I am not making a promise for something I can't guarantee I'll keep. Again, this goes back to the good faith effort: I'll legitimately try my best to give her what she wants. I will also stipulate that if she trusts me, she won't ask again.

22145,Relationships,2teoku,"We have been married for 5 years together for over 7 years.  I'm sorry if this is really long.

He works in sales and travels around the area we live in ( mostly day trips few overnights here and there)  He also manages employees at various stores for the company. 

He basically lives on his phone.  Comes home most nights around 6 and is on the phone or texting with employees for an hour or more sometimes. All work related. 

I went in to our phone account to pay the bill in early January and notices pages of texts on his number with a number I did not recognize.  Most of the numbers he texts and calls frequently I know. I asked him whose number this was and he said it was an employee he was looking to promote in one of the stores. 

The next night he came home and immediately went into the bedroom and was talking to someone quietly. After he got off the phone I asked who it was.  He said it was the employee he was trying to promote.  He said she was 23, single mother etc and trying to help her out. I didn't understand why if it was only about work and the promotion he had to go into the bedroom and talk quietly. Most work conversations are out in the open. 

The next morning while he was showering I decided to check his phone.  I felt really disgusted with myself resorting to this but his behavior was out of character.  I found pages of texts where they are flirty, talking about music they both like,  he took a picture of her and made it her her icon and set her a ringtone of a song she likes. Now I don't even have a ringtone in his phone just the normal one he uses. Just texts back and forth all day long through the work day and none really work related. He ended the conversation with saying that he doesn't like the idea of her out driving at night alone.

I immediately got this sinking sick feeling in my stomach.  My previous marriage had ended because of serial cheating and I immediately began feeling like it was happening again. 

I confronted him on the texts and the nature of them. He told me it wasn't anything but work, he has no interest in her other than work related and I was right some of it was flirty and it crossed the line. He told me he would tell her to stop texting and they were to only speak when it was work related and on the store phone. 

I thought that was the end of it. But of course my curiosity got the better of me. I checked our account again last night and they are still texting. He also had 3 long phone conversations with her yesterday all over 20 minutes.  

I confronted him again last night.  He says yes they are still talking and texting, and it's nothing flirty.  He told me he talks to her 3-4 times a day sometimes more.  I told him it made me uncomfortable. he doesn't really understand why.  He says there is nothing going on with her. 

Am I the one that is overreacting? Am I letting things from my past cloud my judgement?

I was not skinny when I met him, I was actually kind of chubby but he still dated me anyway with no complaints. I lost a bunch of weight (my choice), became pretty skinny, now I'm average again, maybe 10 pounds over but I carry my weight well.


My bf keeps saying that he wants me to lose weight. He even said my size makes him uncomfortable in public because he feels we don't look good together and that it feels like some connection is missing from us because of my size. I have doubts that I can ever be skinny again. 


I feel like I should start exercising and watching what I eat again, honestly. I would actually like to lose a couple pounds. But at the same time it hurts my feelings he's acting shallow about my weight. I don't have a gut or anything, nor am I fat. I'm simply just not skinny anymore and I have naturally wide hips and a big butt, so it's hard for me to look rail-thin. Should I dump him? Is he being unreasonably shallow?

12828,Relationships,1izaca,"A bit of backstory: we met about 1.5 years ago. She was dating a guy at the time who was emotionally controlling/abusive. Long story short, she broke it off with him to be with me. From the get go we were hanging out every day, whenever possible. So when our leases came up to renew at the same time (2 months after beginning to date...I know) we decided to move in together. We just re-upped our year lease 2 months ago.

There are a few issues that have occurred through the relationship, but when they don't get resolved they begin to crop up again and again and eat at me; getting worse each time. Here's what I'm struggling with:

**Cligniness**: I don't know if that's a word, but she is super clingy. If I don't sit with her on the couch, I get a pouty face and she's sad for awhile, despite my saying that I'm allowed to sit on other pieces of furniture without her. Same deal if I want to go on the computer in the office, after a few minutes she'll come in and just watch me, which is annoying to say the least. If I go out with friends and I say It's just the boys tonight I get questioned and the pouty look again. I'm an only child, before her I was pretty used to having my alone time. Now I find it suffocating. I have discussed this with her but I don't feel like it ever really sticks. Hell she pouted when I said that I am joining a gym...which is an extra hour 3 days a week.

**No friends/hobbies**- she's got no interests really outside of gaming so nothing else to do really. Whereas I play sports, take rec classes, read, etc. Much of the stuff I do she's not really into so she sits around bored until I come home. I find this annoying, I really value ambition and passion in a partner and it feels like I'm her only hobby. She also very rarely hangs out with friends, which she doesn't have much of. Couples that we've tried to hang out with don't want to hang out again. When we're in a group, she relates to people by saying I I I in a very braggart/self centred sort of way. It gets to the point that people start to ignore what she says. I think it's a lack of self esteem that makes her do that, like she's always trying to prove herself. Either way, I've got a ton of friends, not all of which like hanging with both of us, and alot of which I would rather hang out with alone. I look 20 years in the future and I see myself as a guy without any friends because they've all fallen away, which I don't want at ALL.

**Little disagreements**: If she thinks she's right on something, she sticks to her guns. Hard. Unnecessarily hard. To the point where you have to argue argue argue to convince her, for example, that what you see in the sky isn't a flock of birds but rather planes. This is a real story, I saw some planes doing some tricks and I said wow look at the planes and she says what do you mean, those are birds in a very 'I'm obviously right' tone. 5 minutes of back and forth escalation and stupidity later the birds emitted smoke from their rumps and I was proven right. To which she said Oh you mean the planes, I was looking over there *vaguely points in a direction*. She does this all the time, I can't stand it.

**Immaturity**- this is one word she absolutely hates being called but it fits like a glove. If I take a tone with her or say the wrong thing, she clams up and won't talk. I'm then forced to ask her what's wrong. This happens especially when I'm frustrated at something (not her). She'll clam up because I'm frustrated, which makes me feel like I have to ask her wtf is wrong, which in turn makes me feel like I'm not allowed to feel what I feel. We've spoken specifically about this and agreed that me saying I'm grumpy or something like that first will help her not shut down. But I don't understand why that should make things better. She's also done the clam up thing in public, which I just ignore for the time being, then when we get home I ask her what was wrong and she'll say nothing, I'm over it, to which I reply if it's nothing you wouldn't have stopped speaking, and I'm bound to do whatever it is again, so what is it?. She then, without fail, says you're making it worse by talking about it now, I'm over it. Which is the total opposite of open communication that I would like to have.

Another immaturity situation was when I was eating lunch at my office with her, and a whole bunch of coworkers around me. She proceeds to stick her finger in my mouth. I said Stop it, I don't want that. She shut down, and when I brought it up later she literally cried for an hour about it, saying that She thought I was different. I said I had no idea what was happening. 


**Kids**- The biggest reason I'm reconsidering this relationship though is kids. I want kids. Always have. She doesn't. I said that it's not fair to either of us to stay together if we want different things like kids/no kids. She says I guess if I have to have kids to stay with you I will. Which was about the worst answer ever for me. 


**tl;dr**: A bunch of random issues are making me reconsider this relationship. I guess i'm just venting but what are everybody's thoughts?

884,Breakups,202vws,"We've been living together for 3 years, since last summer we've been a little off. I got the birth control implant a year ago which turned me into a totally different person, moody all the time and never felt like being intimate. That took a toll on us, but I got it taken out recently, things improved but we're still not back to normal. On top of that we've been moving so that put a little strain on us as well. We've never been great at communicating so any time we have a problem we get pissy then a day later it's like it never happened. In the last few weeks I quit my job thinking I had another lined up then that didn't work out so I've just been sitting around the house doing nothing for 2 weeks, that's been stressing him out. He also applied for a new job and has been stressing about that too, so both of our job situations have been giving him anxiety lately.

Yesterday he said we wanted to break up. We don't communicate well, we don't do anything besides watch TV, we don't have similar goals (he really likes working on projects all the time and always stays busy, I'm more interested in watching TV or hanging out with my friends), our intimacy has gotten better but it's still not where it used to be. I want to work on everything, he's my best friend and I can't stand the thought of not being with him. His happiness is important to me, I want to be the one to make him happy but if he's better off without me so be it. We decided to take a break and see where we're at in a week while I'm staying somewhere else. I'm really hoping this can just serve as a kind of reset for us while we take some time apart and de-stress, but I'm worried he'll see that he's better off without me and still want to end it.

My SO and I met on an online dating site in mid-August, and have been pretty close since our first date (I would say inseparable, but because of distance we can't really see each other as often as we'd like. It's nothing like a LDR, but it's about an hour either way via public transit to each of our respective places of living). Despite not being able to see each other as often as we'd like we text constantly, have hours long skype sessions almost nightly , and we put forth the maximum amount of effort into getting together as much as we can - even if it means spending 2 hours on the subway to spend just 5 together on a night when we both have to work the next morning. 

Honestly, this relationship is absolutely wonderful. We're completely frank, honest and open with each other in almost any way (about sex, issues we've had, or just life in general), have a lot of fun together and share each other's interests (we have some in common, and some different which both of us are happy to learn about and experience a little with the other even if it's not always our cup of tea). He's incredibly caring, kind, funny, sweet, everything anyone including myself would hope for in a boyfriend. And most importantly I want nothing but to give back everything he gives to me and more. 

I really do love him, and have been keeping the words to myself for almost a month now because I'm worried my feelings have shown up a little too early. While I have a wonderful time with him I do sometimes feel like I don't actually know him that well. Yes, I know some of his interests, and it seems like we share the same values, but I have been starting to feel like I actually don't know him that well - on a deeper level anyway. I'm often surprised by some of the actions he takes, or some of the ways he speaks about things. None of it is bad, but obviously I want to know my SO well enough to not be surprised by this. As such, I've become hesitant about even admitting my feelings for him to myself. When he's around, or even when we're just sending idle facebook messages to each other in the middle of the day, I find so many moments where I want to respond I love you. but then I don't because I think 'You've only know him since August, and he -insert recent unexpected thing/action etc here-. How can you be in love with him?'

I'm new to this whole adult relationship thing, my last relationship ended when I was 17 and I've only had awful, one-sided things since. All of these things have been with friends, people I knew before we got involved with one another. Maybe it's my personal hangups that are making me feel this way, but I would like to know if maybe it's normal to be uncertain about someone you've only known for a short period of time.
