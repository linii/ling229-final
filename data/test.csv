380,352xjo,"well as stated in the title me and my girlfriend have been together for 9 years (long time right?).

Well our relationship had ups and downs like all the relationships that last this long but we stick together for a long time.

Well she is graduating from med school (after six years in college) and in my country this is a week dedicated to celebrate the students which means no classes and no work, just partying the whole week in a way I can only resemble to spring break (so those living in the US can relate) It's not quite the same but there's music and alcoholo and of course drugs...

I finished college last year (5 years in college) and I am currently working which means I can't go with her. To those familiar with med school it's a hard work life draining experience to those who study and the people around.

My girlfriend suffers from anxiety and has been stressing a lot during this year because of one final exam she has to do that decides to where specialty she goes (depending on the grade of this exam). Pretty stressful right?

Well my girlfriend is also quite the party girl, since she doesn't have much time to party because of med school (again) she decided to go the whole week at this event. I see her almost everyday because the event is near our house. 

Now, I'm not feeling insecure or afraid as I trust my girlfriend and her friends and even if I don't it's not my place to judge.

The whole point of this post is this simple question.

I know that she will be exhausted after this week and she has to go back to study and hospital without having a rest (we are talking 7 days of party all night and some activities in the afternoon).
And I also know I will have to deal with her anxiety for not studying this whole week.

Now I don't know if I will have the strength to put up with her anxiety since this week she didn't think one minute about that and I am a firm believer everyone should deal with the consequences of the actions they choose to do.

But, since I'm more mature now and I am thinking I should give her support anyway. 

Still need your advice on this one since I will probably will have to deal with a lot of anger for not being able to say that it's her own fault she didn't think one minute about what bothers her. But when it's time to take a vacation with me she never can because she needs to study.

TL,DR: Girlfriend graduating med school has no time to go out with me because she has to study, making me go to her place and watch her study but took this whole week to party with friends.

450,2n059l,"Me and My girlfriend(hopefully soon to be Fiance/Wife) are having some trouble with our different beliefs and raising future children.  NOTE: I am not looking for communication advise we plan on having a serious talk about this soon but i was to show up with potential compromises and potential solutions in the form of hard ideas not just empty handed.

For starters we have been together almost 6 years now and have a happy healthy relationship, we argue a bit but have gotten good at solving our various differences so fights are quick and civil.  We plan on living together come summer which is around the time I plan on proposing. We have waited to move in together due to her religious beliefs wanting to be at least engaged.  (I plan on proposing a month before the move in date). 

My girlfriend is quite religious though Liberal at the same time.  She goes to work every week and will teach Sunday school one month a year(their church has a rotation).  She has never pushed religion on me and she generally keeps it quiet when around others.  

I myself am Atheist/agnostic(I don't think there is a God but I don't deny the possibility of one existing).  And I generally dislike organized religion quite a bit but I love my GF and religious differences have never been a problem.  It should be noted I greatly dislike organized religion itself but I am ok with how my GF handles religion in her daily life.

We have all our future plans for marriage/engagement/travel/where we live/number of children/etc. planned out and discussed but we have one Issue we can't seen to find an agreement on and that is raising our children with religion.  We both agree that once the children are old enough to make logical decisions or desires that they can choose their relationship with church and God(her church doesn't let children under 12 be baptized they say the child must make the choice).  

Our issue now is discussing the first few years with future children.  The first few years with children can greatly affect how they view the world the rest of their lives so it is important plus we both have strong beliefs to do with religion.

Originally when we had this discussion at 19 we eventually mutually agreed to have the children do one week at church and the next week with me(wouldn't be just sleeping in it would be bonding/learning time with me) and so on.  Now note that this was 3 years ago and people change a ton in that time and more so because it was through the college years(both attended college).

Now she is pushing to have the children go to church every week because as she sees it(paraphrased) then they will be religious only 1/7th of the time not all the time, I see this as them being full time religious because they are going to church full time.  

We are both stuck in our spots on this and I'm wondering if there is any other potential solution or idea that I can bring to the table or if we just have to have one of us give in?  This is a big issue and something that needs to be solved long before the children show up as that would not be fair to them to have the argument continue.

574,2c26q7,"I feel really hurt by this. 

I have two friends, who are dating. Let's call them James and Katie. 

Last year, they got evicted from their apartment. I let them stay on my fold-out for almost a month until they had enough money saved.

They moved out and while they did buy their own groceries, I never asked them to help with the rent or utilities. I also figured if I asked for money then they would have to stay longer, and James was already losing his patience because of my cat. They wanted their own space and it kind of killed the romance. James also didn't like the guy I was dating at the time (understandable) but it was my apartment so they really didn't have a say in who came over to visit me. 

Now, my birthday is in two weeks and Katie said she wanted to thank me for what happened last year. She said she won four tickets to Disneyland. 

Katie assured me that it would be her treat, for all I did for her. This was really touching and I was super excited. I took the day off work and have been anxious to go. I have never been. 

I get a call from James telling me that they want to leave at X time so they get there before opening. He wants to stay until the last fireworks. I am totally down. 

As the day gets closer, James and Katie seem to be on different pages. Katie keeps telling me not to worry. But James has made comments about how we got the tickets, you should pay for the gas/food. 

It sounds like James thinks I am going to pay for the whole trip. 

Am I wrong to feel like I am being taken advantage of? I did not do them a favor thinking I would get something in return, but when I am told it is a treat... I kind of expected they would not be demanding I pay for them. 

I am willing to pay for my own gas. 1/3 of the gas is fair. I am willing to bring/pay for my own food, treats, games, whatever. But I don't feel like it is fair to expect I am going to pay all the gas and food for them. Does that make sense?

I feel like it's a really bitchy thing to do and I don't want to end a friendship over a ticket to Disneyland. I want to talk about this, but we are supposed to go next week and I really was excited about it.

**Some backstory:**




My 2 older brothers are from my mom's previous marriage and are significantly older than me (13 and 10 years respectively).  For sake of keeping track of people, my oldest brother is Brother A and the second oldest is Brother B.  I've always been significantly closer to Brother B than Brother A; Brother B was my best friend, whereas I barely had any relationship with A.  When I was 14, Brother B got married and was super happy and we all LOVED his wife, while Brother A was in jail for various reasons.  However, Brother B did drugs and made some poor life choices and ended up getting divorced.  We also suspected that one of our cousins was going after my brother's wife (which ended up being true), which added to these problems.  When I was 18, Brother A got out of jail.  Right after this, Brother B was in severe depression and ended up committing suicide.  





Over the last 7 years, Brother A has been in and out of jail for various reasons, and I have zero respect for the man for what he has done to his family (has 2 kids and has almost no relationship with either of them, both by different mothers, taking advantage of all of them while having other women on the side).  So I have no relationship with him and quite frankly didn't want one, but tried to be civil for my mom's sake.  Because of these things he has been doing, he has had a very strained relationship with our mother and the rest of our family.  My mom still loves him (he is her oldest) and tries to help him out and be there for him whenever she can, but he's just making really poor choices and it's been very hard on her.  We also recently found out that Brother B's ex-wife and his cousin are together and living a very happy life in the midwest.  Granted we don't agree on how the 2 ended up getting together, but they seem happy nonetheless and we still love them and consider them part of the family. 





Fast forward to the last few weeks.  Brother A is living in Florida and we live in New England.  He has a new girlfriend who he got pregnant.  They bought a house and all new furniture, but ends up leaving her to go back to NY, but ends up going back to her.  She ended up having a miscarriage.  Brother A and my mom's relationship starts to get better and more respectful... until last night.




**Last Night**




Brother A found out about ex-wife and cousin being together and is blaming them for Brother B's depression and suicide.  He calls my mother last night (I think in a drunken and/or drug-induced rage) screaming at her saying he's going to go to the state they live and kill them both because of what they did to Brother B.  He's also saying that it's my mom's and his dad's fault that Brother B died because they told him not go see Brother B when he was distressed.  That is NOT true, when in fact my mother was going to go see Brother B and he and his father told her not to go because B was having a pity party.  So now he is lying to try and justify what he wants to do.  He called my mother 4 times last night, screaming at her and making sarcastic comments, saying how she deserves to be dead and fuck her and the rest of our family.  We haven't heard from him since last night.





So I'm not going to lie - I am absolutely terrified that he is going to harm someone in our family, whether it's my cousins or us.  My mom has called some of our immediate family members (Brother A's oldest daughter and her mother and cousin's mother) to inform them and let them know what is going on.  I told my mom to change our phone number so he can't call us anymore.  He does have Facebook and I am friends with him (only was for my mother's sake).  However, we are hesitant to change/delete anything for fear of making him even more angry than he already is because he suspects my mother is avoiding him (which I can't blame her).  Granted he is in Florida and we are in New England, but he knows where we live and is somewhat resourceful in getting to places where he needs to be.  I'm afraid if he's threatening to kill other members of our family, if we piss him off then would he come here and do that to us?  Brother A's father lives in Florida too and says he gets threats from him often.  My mom and I talked about calling the police if he does something again, but would they be able to do anything?  Especially because we are in total opposite parts of the country?  I honestly think that because my brother has spent the better part of the last 12 years in jail that he doesn't know how to function properly outside of jail.

393,2qd01d,"I met this girl in school, we're in the same university program and we had all of our classes together last semester. She's smart, open-minded, we share a lot of things in how we think. She's also naturally pretty, she has a pretty face and nice body features. But she's overweight. Not morbidly obese, but she clearly has a lot of surplus fat around her gluteus maximus muscle, I can tell. But I can also tell that, physically, she could be my dream girl... if she had 20 pounds less, that is.  

I'm pretty confident that, if I asked her out, she would say yes, but I don't wanna date her or even start anything with her if I'm not certain that she will agree to exercising and living a healthy lifestyle. She told that she had had a shitty year last year and, during that year, that she had gained a lot weight. So I'm pretty confident that she could easily lose that surplus fat if she put her mind to it. But I'm scared that she wouldn't wanna do it. 

So how do I make sure that she will wanna live more healthy and lose weight, without hurting her feelings and in a way that will motivate her? By the way, I know it's not only about physical appearance and that you guys will hate me, but I spend 15 hours on average exercising weekly and I count all my calories daily, so living healthy is a pretty big deal for me. I'm ready to be a loving, caring and motivating boyfriend and to help her with the long process of losing stored fat. But if she doesn't want to in the first place, there's nothing I can do.

107,2bfk3v,"Approximately one year ago, my girlfriend's high school friend Josh [23M] passed away unexpectedly. I recognize that people experience death differently, but she seemed to be taking it extremely hard. Months after his death, she continued to experience anxiety attacks, insomnia, and lost weight. I did my best to support her, but she would never open up to me about her feelings, so I let it go once she started seeing a therapist. Things began to slowly get better and she returned to normal about 7 months after his death.

This morning I was alone in her apartment, helping organize things because she is moving soon. While packing up her old travel journals, I saw one that I had not read/seen before. Upon reading a few pages, I realized this was no travel journal, but a diary containing several long messages to Josh. 

The journal told me what she had refused to; in high school they had fallen in love but had never had the chance to be together for various reasons. She met me shortly after high school, and Josh moved out of state to another college. She wrote long grief filled messages in letter format, asking him to forgive her for never being strong enough to admit her love, that she regretted never being able to date him, and that she loved him. While this hurt me, I was able to understand that she was grieving, so I wasn't going to even mention it to her. But then I read some more recent entries (undated so it's hard to say when, but around 6 to 8 month post-death) in which she writes I love you, I wish I had chosen you, I regret everything except that I was once the luckiest girl in the world. This is just one example of various things she wrote, and they crushed me. Her final letter to him stated that she was trying to move on and that moving out of this city will be for the best. (Note we are both moving and will be in 5 hour long distance relationship).

When she got home I put the journal in front of her and asked her to explain things to me. Through tears, she claimed that her regret and love for him referred back to high school, when she dated another guy, and was unable to date Josh despite having a close friendship. She also claims that she loves me and is begging for my forgiveness, and that she is ashamed/sad that she didn't have the courage to share this with me. 

Yet I still feel hurt. I feel like I was her second choice, and that maybe if he hadn't died they might have ended up together when he returned home. I feel like I'm being emotionally cheated on with a dead person.

Her excuses seemed genuine and plausible, and I know that death and depression influenced her emotions, and that she thinks the world of me, but at this moment I just can't forgive her. I told her I needed to spend the day alone to collect my thoughts and emotions, but I'm still at a loss of what to do or how to move past this. Part of me is hurt enough/doesn't believe the entire story, while the other part is understanding and forgiving. 

Any advice?

63,3306fr,"So my gf and I have been together 1.5 years, and for most of it, I'd say something like 99%, we've been very happy. But lately things have been strained.

She's dealing with some issues-- depression, something I've dealt with for the last 4 years as well. Recently she's been going to therapy (so she's never around anymore except the weekends), and I'm happy she's finally seeking the help she needed.

The gist of it is that lately, she's been too tired to do anything really, besides sleep and have me massage her or rub her head (she has migraines as well). At least, that's what she tells me. 

We don't go out anymore (roughly 2 months), and for a while, we were just a stay at home couple. Netflix, homecooked meals or quick dinners, etc, and then off to bed. 

For the most part, I'm okay with this. I knew she was having issues, and I respected that she has limitations on what she can do about them. I tried my best not to force anything on her, and be supportive of her needs so that she could get better. 

Lately however, I've been stressed (I still deal with my depression, though I don't bring up the extent to which it is severe. I hide it fairly well) and I needed a break from all of my regular work and monotony. So I imagined that we could go out, at least once in a while, to blow off steam.

However, she always responds with I didn't know you wanted to go out, or I don't have the energy to go out or do stuff. This applies to just about everything. From dinner to drinks or partying. With me, at least.

She still goes out with her friends, and still goes to parties, but I'm usually excluded from these events. She says she doesn't bring me out of consideration for how busy my schedule is, but to be frank, most of the time she just doesn't mention it or invite me, and then comes back drunk or tired-- whereby I take care of her. 

This weekend, I had invited her on a trip to take our minds off of everything (I asked about 2-3 weeks ago) and she said that she would think about it, because her friend was going to celebrate her birthday (same place) that weekend too. 

Fast-forward to 2 weeks of me waiting on her hand and feet in between my studies or shifts at work, and she tells me that she's going with her friend for her birthday. To which, I say, What the fuck? At this point, I cannot go anywhere. I haven't planned at all for a trip, and she intends to go with her friends only. She contends that she is obligated to go-- because she told her friend she would be in attendance before I had asked.

However, my contention is that as obligated as she is to her friend, she must feel some obligation to me, right? 

I didn't explicitly say how much I needed a break from school and work, but she sees how hard I work, and I spend the remainder of my free time taking care of her. So is it a stretch that she would want to take the trip with me? Am I being unreasonable?

I get she wants to spend time with her friends and stuff, but I kinda needed her to say okay let's go crazy for a weekend, spend the entire time drunk and having copious amounts of sex, make googly eyes during meals, etc. Why am I responsible for explicitly stating that 100% of the time? When does romance and whatnot become a shared responsibility? I can't even get her to stop watching netflix for 5 seconds to tell her I had a shitty day. 


This has been going on a while-- Every argument we have comes back to: do you prioritize me as much as I prioritize you? No? That's okay. But there has to be some back and forth right? No.

TL:DR-- When do I pronounce the relationship as dead? How do I get my SO to treat me like a priority, not like a crutch?

1038,2aourn,"Hi,
My GF broke up with me one month ago, it was all kinda rushed cause we were texting and she behaved a little weird the 2-3 days before so I asked her whats up and if shes not feeling well. Well, long story short, she broke up with me, first on the phone, later we talked (at a party and I was kinda drunk and kinda...let her get out of it a bit to easy, I guess).

Well, her reasons were the following:

 I wasn't going out enough with her and she didnt want to stay home as often as we did.

 I said, fine , we can go out more, even though I dont really like it, I could do that for her and it would be fine.

 She said no, she does not want me to change and that it makes no sense for me to do things I dont like for her.



 We kinda parted ways after this, even though we have the same circle of friends. So this is all a month ago, and I kinda still feel that its completely unnecessary to end our relationship, I loved and love her so much and she said she did too. I also asked if that is really all thats bothering her because that makes no sense to me, why would she not love me anymore cause we didnt go out enough. I am about to call her and ask her if she really doesnt want to try it again. She was also my first gf so I am kinda inexperienced with all of this.


 I was so happy with her, she was nice, beatiful and just my dream girl. Throwing all that away seems so unnecessary.
Should I talk to her again and ask her,even though she already said that she doesnt see a way and she doesnt want me get changed by her? 
Hope someone can help me with my situation.
All I want is get her back :(

1202,1oqwww,"My girlfriend and I had been best friends all through high school. I finally asked her out senior year and have been going steady since. Yesterday she put us on a break of sorts because she had been thinking since she started college again. She said she had all sorts of what-if's in her head like what if there's someone else for her.

I had a long relationship with a girl in high school, but she never had a boyfriend until me. She said I had something to compare our relationship to while she didn't. I had made up my mind that she is the one a bit ago and it was only a matter of time before I proposed. She didn't have anything to compare our relationship to so she didn't know about a future together. 

She put us on a break to sort out her thoughts and maybe see other people until she has some epiphany to know what to do. We've decided to try and remain friends because we don't want to lose such a long friendship. She has plans every night this weekend with people I don't know and won't tell me what they're doing which makes me scared. I knew she was going to see other people and stuff and I'm okay with it. I sound so controlling and obsessive but I can't handle not knowing. Just as her friend I need to know she's safe and not doing anything that may hurt herself. I know she doesn't have to tell me everything anymore but when she doesn't my mind goes to worst case scenarios.

667,2e9xb4,"So I've seen her several times, we've had sex multiple times, the sex gets better and better. I like her personally, we seem very compatible. However, I'm only a few months (less than four) out of a very long term relationship. 

She's a rebound relationship, obviously. I am not presuming that all rebound relationships are bad - although I do understand they can be risky (perhaps more for her than for me, IDK).

I went ahead and invited her on a weekend trip recently, which was lots of fun - saw some sights but basically just stayed in the house and was naked for the entire weekend. :-)

Now that I've been home for a few days, I start to feel nervous. I don't have a huge drive to see other people or stop seeing this girl, but I feel like I'm starting to get 'clingy' and 'needy' - like I need to call her or message her at least daily. I don't want to be that person, I think being clingy and needy also was a feature in my previous relationship and frankly it sets me up for bad stuff down the line.

So I made a point yesterday of not calling or texting her at all. I communicated well about this with her beforehand, to let her know I'd be doing that. Still, it wasn't easy.... I really did want to call her or message her.... I guess just to sort of make sure she was still out there or something (CLINGINESS!). But I didn't. 

Anyways, my plan is to wait until the end of today and simply text her and ask when I can see her next. But the larger question is, what is too fast for a rebound relationship, or a relationship in general, particularly since I think I have a tendency to get clingy, needy, and have poor boundaries when I really like someone? Should I continue to build in days off from calling her or texting her? Is there some other way I can keep the pace of this comfortable so I don't get overwhelmed? How do other people put themselves first in a healthy way in a new relationship? I confess I'm probably not that good at it....

Everything has been great. We get along amazing. I'll be the first one to admit to instagram stalk her. I check the pictures she likes. I'll be 100% honest and you'll have to trust me on this one - I do it not because I distrust her, but mainly because I want to see what she finds interesting and for ideas for dates/gifts. And considering I follow few people on ig, the 'liked stream' of my the people I follow is a part of the fun, in a way. But I digress - she generally likes pictures of birds (she loves birds), her coworker's friends, and Peter's photos.

Peter is a guy with 700 followers and follows 900. They follow eachother since around December I believe, but I could be wrong. My girlfriend generally does not like any of her 'closer' guy friends' pictures. She's rather selective with her liking. Yet she has liked about 6 of his last 30 photos on instagram. She has never spoken to me about him, even if she usually tells me about people who she likes and are part of her life. Bottom line is that this behaviour is not typical for her from what I've seen.

I checked on facebook, it seems like they are not friends on Facebook and have no friends in common.

Coupled with the fact that admitted cheating on one of her ex (trickle truthed, I'd imagine she cheated on more than one of her exes), and on one other occasion being excited to see her ex at a party we went to, her fucky behaviour is making me anxious.

I think it's well established that I'm kind of crazy, no need to remind me of that. My question is whether I am justifiably anxious and put off by her liking so many of this guy's selfies. And also, how do I bring my discomfort, or should I bring it up at all?

He looks young for his age and is very young in spirit, hence me not knowing he was significantly older at first. We continued to stay in touch for most of the next year (text, phone, chat, Skype) but he didn't want things to get serious for numerous reasons (he was still straightening things out with his ex, I was still in college, etc etc). Fast-forward to last summer, I graduate, we decide to try dating long-distance. He helped me move across the country after college, and we took turns buying plane tickets to visit each other every other month. We both decided that I needed to live on my own for a year before we would even attempt living together. This June, he flew up and drove down with me in my car to move me in with him.

Obviously he is dedicated on some level or he would never have gone through this trouble. The real trouble is our sex life. He is extremely blunt and open telling me what he finds sexy/attractive, saying things like 'even when you live here, I'm still gonna masturbate' (duh, okay), talking about his favorite porn stars, etc. So I know he has interest in porn. But after we'd been dating awhile, he told me his sex drive basically dropped off after age 25 and he stopped pursuing sex at that point (he'd had several relationships since, but obviously none successful). He seems to have some serious physical intimacy issues. He told me he'd been molested by a male neighbor when he was a pre-teen, but claims it has nothing to do with this...then he told me AS WE WERE DRIVING to his place in June that he saw a doctor for ED when he stopped being able to get erections with his last girlfriend. I took the chance and continued our relationship because he's an awesome guy and we have fun together, but it's beginning to look like the same thing is happening to us. I have a healthy sex drive and it's confusing and ego-bruising to have to be the one to initiate sex every time. I have several ideas as to what's happening here - already tried to ask him if this is a porn-related issue or has to do with what happened to him with his neighbor; he replied no. He says I'm one of the hottest girls he's ever dated, that I have a great body, etc etc...but I can walk around naked, cuddle up against him, and his dick doesn't even twitch, so I am stumped. I tried lingerie to spice things up and it worked on one occasion, but once he's seen me in an outfit once, it's not exciting anymore after that. I've suggested watching porn together, toys, etc...he'll just say 'yeah, maybe' and then it never happens.

I can't help but feel there is something going on here that he is severely holding back from sharing with me. I have no reason to suspect it's cheating/another relationship.

To put it simply, I feel like she isn't putting in the effort to see each anymore these last few months. For example, I would make plans to see her a couple days in advance to clear it with her. She would say yes but inevitably in some shape or form, stands me up.

Some cases, a friend would ask her to hang out the same time we are suppose to see each other. She would say yes and tell me the last moment that she can only see me briefly. Other times, I would go to her apartment to pick her up and go out. Unfortunately, she has stayed out all night and didn't sleep until morning so she winds up sleeping in. The rest of the time she flats out forget.

This trend leaves me feeling hurt and frustrated. I don't know what to do. I talked to her about it but the same thing winds up happening. I don't feel that I am being needy or clingy because I would have been fine if she no to me to hang out with her friends. The problem is she says 'yes' and winds up stringing me along. I am a busy buy and I work hard to get things done to be able to spend time with her.

I know she doesn't mean to do it on purpose as it is just who is (always late for work and forgetful) but I'm sure its not too much to ask to put in a little effort to see through plans.

Am I being touchy and should learn to roll with punches or am I reasonable to feel this way?

I (26m) have been with my girlfriend (23f) for 5 years. We are from the same home town, but did not start dating until she moved out to our current city. 

She maintains a small group of friends back home, a mixture of 5 or 6 guys and girls. The guys treat the girls like their little sisters, except for one. 

Phil will cross the line into creepy every so often. He sends texts to my GF every couple of months ranging from hey how's things? To miss you lots ;) and then full on  hey had a dream last night that we were married with kids haha wouldn't that be crazy? Lol

She will just treat him as if he never sent those texts in order to not make it awkward in her group of friends, and at the same time she will never hang out with this guy one on one, she always makes sure at least one other person is coming, even if she has to bring me ( that has happened, the disappointed look on his face was obvious)

The so-called advances he makes are not so blatant such that they need to illicit a response from her,  and although she just brushes it off, I don't think its alright for him to subtly hit on her every few months to test the waters so to speak. They've never been romantically involved at any point.

 Me and this guy played on the same sports teams in high school, we are not friends but certainly more than acquaintances. I'm not jealous nor do I feel threatened, but I feel disrespected for sure. 

I'm not sure if it is my place to say something, but even if I did I feel like he would deny that that was his intention, despite the fact that my GF feels awkward enough to not want to hang out with him 1 on 1. My GF will not say anything to him unless he blatantly crosses the line, which I don't think he has the balls to ever do, so she would rather just deal with the awkwardness.

It is also well known within the friend group that Phil has always had a crush on my GF.

TL;DR my girlfriend's old high school friend quite literally waits in the wings as a vulture would, subtly hitting on her and hoping to get a response.

636,1n5ju2,"First off this is a throw away account that I use so she can't find it. I have been dating her for a year with the last 4 months being long distance. We are both in college and went to our respective homes to intern for the summer. She met a guy and instantly became friends with him. I was unsure about it and didn't like how much time they spent alone, but there was nothing I could do besides tell her. She would drink with him all the time and tell me that he would go home and would talk to me before bed. I didn't like how much she hung out with him, but I accepted that at least she took him home at night.  While at the same job, there was an older guy (about 27) who would give her a lot of attention.

From what I was told, he wanted her but she wasn't interested. I found her facebook password a while ago and have been checking it. I don't know why I do since I trust her and she hasn't done anything that would tell me otherwise. We both love each other, but I'm feeling sick at the moment after what I read. She told me that she would stop talking to him after summer was over and I believed her. Well she has been talking to him again starting the conversation every time. Today, while she was waiting for me to come home, he confessed how much he liked her and she was saying thing that made me sick like how she was glad he didn't tell her when she worked there because she wasn't sure she would have the willpower to say no. She also said specifically how she had to lie to me a lot about how much he would sleep in the same room over the summer (it had 2 twin beds and I'm 99.9% sure nothing happened) because they both got drunk and she didn't want to tell me so she wouldn't have to deal with it.

I feel sick right now and she is 9 hours ahead so I can't talk to her for at least a few hours due to her sleeping. I know that I shouldn't have snooped, but I don't know what to do or how to confront her about this whole thing. Looking back, I'm not upset that she had him stay over, I'm upset that she lied to me about it. And I'm also upset that she didn't say that she wasn't interested in they guy confessing how he liked her and kept egging him on.

My only logic is that she hasn't been getting any male attention for the past month since we won't be able to see each other until the beginning of december. I don't know what to do and I need advice. Should I tell her that I know her password and I'm upset at what I found, or should I tell her that I feel like she is being distant and ask if it has to do with this guy and then bring up the situation that happened over the summer?

Please help! I love her so much and haven't ever met anyone like her. I still trust her, but I just wish she didn't feel like she needs to hide stuff like this from me.

5,39gp3z,"Hello All,
Let's call my girlfriend Sophie. One of Sophie's best friends recently returned from a 2 week trip to Europe with a tour group which, as she described, was full on people partying and casual hookups although she herself did not take part in any hookups. Upon hearing this, Sophie went on about how she wishes she could go on a trip like that (without the hookups since she's in a relationship) and that she feels like she's missing out on having fun, since she lives with very strict parents. She has never lived on her own and as such has never experienced a life free from the constraints of her parents. Nothing wrong with that of course and I sympathize  with that, I lived on my own for 2 years while in uni and my parents have never constrained me from doing what i want when I have lived with them.


What worries me is she is going to start grad school and be there for another 2 years, and is going to continue living at home. Nothing wrong with this so far you may be wondering. The thing I'm worried about is that she said today and again several times in the past that she wants to be able to go out partying and live on her own when shes done with grad school and live a wild life basically, for a short time at least so she can experience it.


I can't really get it across by text, but the way she says, it is like there is a possibility she could break up with me in the future to experience this lifestyle. When I told her I was worried about this I was hoping to hear something like Oh I will never do that lolz, no, she basically said yea that is a possibility however small. At least she was honest I suppose.


About 7 months ago she straight up said she wanted space but that never went through and other than that our relationship has been great. Now, here is what is bothering me, and some of you may find this shallow or petty: She wants to abstain from having sex until marriage. I really like her and respect her reasons for this  so I don't mind waiting until marriage for her but this possibility of a breakup in a few years makes me feel I would be abstaining for no reason. I can't do that. I'm a human, I have a sex drive.


To be honest if I am still with her in 2 years there is like a 90% chance I would propose, if everything is still going well. I do love her, and I can wait another few years if it results in marrying her but if it is for non reason I feel like I am wasting my time.


So basically what I am asking is this: am I being unreasonable and paranoid about her comments? Sometimes I feel like she's just saying this because she's still young, though only 2 years younger than me but 2 years ago I was more or less the same as she is. 


Forgot to mention, one of the reasons I am so confused is because she also talks as if we will someday get married for sure. For example, she constantly says stuff like Our babies will look like this, hope our house will be here, our wedding will be like this, WHEN we get married we should do this etc. No ifs or may she always says will when etc.

1018,3aj0j3,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Obligatory apology for wall of text. This has all been going on for so long it's hard to know where to start. So I guess I'll start from the beginning and include the details I feel are necessary. Sorry if it's rambly. I could really just use some perspective. 

TLDR; I'm concerned for the wellbeing on my niece and nephew because I feel my sister is a poor parent.  

I feel like I'm about to say a lot of negative things about my sister, who we'll call Alex. So I would like to start by saying she is kind hearted and generous. Our family is very close which is part of what makes all this so difficult.  Alex has always been a bit of a handful. When I was younger I remember her constantly at odds with my parents, getting into trouble, teenage rebellion stuff. She moved away to college and the trouble got worse, she got in with a rough crowd, started with hard drugs, we almost lost her and it was a hard time on all of us. She eventually came home and my parents took her in with open arms, she got clean and got a job, things were good for awhile. Not too long after her return, she got pregnant. Bio dad's a deadbeat fresh out of jail and ran off almost as soon as he found out. Alex ended up going back to and marrying her high-school sweetheart, Jay, when she was a few months along. This lasted for awhile, Jay made a genuine effort for some time, they had another kid (my niece) a couple years later. But Jay is an alcoholic deadbeat and eventually settled into being verbally abusive towards my sister, spending all their money on alcohol and who knows what else, and barely helping out with the kids. They eventually got a divorce but it was a long, painful and expensive process, and are still in and out of court regularly fighting over the kids. Jay is terrible to those kids, and without going into too much detail we've done everything possible to keep them away from him as it's an unhealthy and dangerous environment. However he still has partial custody. 


Now back to Alex...I've always felt that Alex is a good mother, who loves her kids and just has been through a lot (even if she is responsible for much of it) and she really seemed to be trying. She has always smoked weed, and she drinks but she used to only do it when the kids were away at their dads or when they were sleeping. The house was usually pretty messy but she always had a roommate or someone around to help keep up on things so it never got too out of control. Over the last couple years things have gotten worse. I live a couple hours away so I'm not around all the time but whenever I visit the house is absolutely disgusting. She has multiple pets, who trash the house and nobody seems to clean up after them. There's fur everywhere and I've seen shit piles just left where they dump. This is important to note because my niece has sever allergies, with excema and asthma that get so bad we've had to take her to the hospital. It's not just the pets, the yard is a disaster, the house is a mess there's dishes and laundry piled up everywhere. My niece still wets the bed and I've seen her just put a towel over it because the laundry room is too messy to wash anything. On top of the house being so bad, Alex has been drinking and smoking excessively. My friend lived with her for awhile and said they were going through $500 worth of alcohol in a month. She also has a medical marijuana card and smokes during the day now, even when the kids are home she'll just go upstairs to do it. 


I think it's important to mention here there's a reason why I haven't talked to my sister about any of this yet. She's near impossible to talk to especially when it has anything to do with the kids or her behavior. In the past whenever anybody tries she immediately gets defensive. She will viscously and personally attack you if she feels you are criticizing her in any way. So pretty much nobody will confront her. Including my parents, who watch the kids about 50% of the time because my sister is going to school and working. They also help out financially. Both of which my sister takes advantage of. She'll often tell my parents she's working so she can spend time with her boyfriend, or use the debit card my mom has given her to get necessities to buy beer. I've talked to my mom about some of this, she always defends my sister saying she tries to keep the house clean and she's just really busy, and she really tries to be a good mom. I feel I should mention that the boyfriend my sister's with now has been around for a few years now, and has made it very clear he does not love the kids as his own. They've broken up in the passed over this, but they're together now and he claims he's trying but he barely spends any time with them and would rather pawn them off on my parents then actually have them around. This doesn't seem to bother my sister. 

I've held back from saying anything thus far partially because I'm not around. Maybe it's not as bad as I think just from the brief times I've visited? However recently I went on a trip with my sister and the kids and what I saw scared me. She treats the kids terribly, not like I've ever seen her do before. She yells at them, puts them down, swears at them. My nieces excema is the worst I've ever seen it, she looks sickly the poor thing is so miserable and I never once saw my sister give her any medications or apply anything to her skin the whole time we were together. 


I'm scared for the kids, and I'm worried about my sister. Things seem like they're just getting worse and worse. It seems clear to me my sister is dealing with substance abuse issues, although nobody else seems to see it. I also feel she is neglectful and verbally abusive to the kids, who have already been through so much. I don't have any idea what to do. I want to confront her but I don't know how to do it in a way that will be productive. I've considered calling CPS but I'm afraid if that happens the kids will go back to their dad who's even worse. Or get put into foster care. I'm at a loss. I know something should be done but I'm still almost in disbelief that this has gotten so bad in the first place. I just want whats best for the kids. If anybody has any advice or insight to help give me some perspective I would greatly appreciate it.

33,27lli2,"A little back story first.

So there's this girl. We'll call her Betty for anonymous reasons. First off I really like her, but I don't think she sees me as a possibility to date for reasons of attraction, and because I think she's not looking for a relationship. There's been this friend, Fred who has been a friends with benefits with her over the last like 10 months while I was away at school. I came back, and they're still doing this, which is fine. Betty is bi-sexual, and also has been fooling around with another girl my friends are all familiar with, but also not seriously dating her. My friend Fred is totally cool with her messing with whoever she wants, and he understands they don't have a monogamous relationship, but all he asked was that she doesn't make out etc. with the other girl in front of him, which is reasonable to me. Betty didn't like that, and I think felt hurt, and went out of her way to avoid Fred, or would show affection (hugs, and the other friendly things) in front of him, but offer him little, or less than that same level to him. After a couple weeks of that behavior, it looks like they're friends again, but not doing any FWB things. It's good now, but it looked like they weren't going to be friends again.

The difference between Fred and myself is that he lives a little ways away from Betty's house, and I live here. By that I mean no one cares that I'm here all the time (Like every day), and when things go south he can go home. 

I love living with my friends. We get along so good, and I would be sad if I was asked to leave. With Fred not being a FWB with her anymore, Betty has been a little more affectionate towards me both with compliments, and hugs. Lame, and small sure, but it's just different, so worth noting. 

I recently had a bonfire at my parent's place, and Betty was invited. She wasn't dressed properly, and had no alcohol, so I gave her a hoodie, and a couple beers. She eventually joined us at the fire. She was just standing there because no seats were available, so I just asked her Betty, wanna sit on my lap? She said sure. And she sat deep on my left thigh. 

Now comes the reason I use a throwaway. I'm a virgin. Closest I've came with a girl is head, but never been all the way. I'm still easily excited when anything remotely sexual happens, and it embarrasses me that I can't refrain from an erection when something somewhat exciting happens. Hell, I walk around with a halfie all day at work, and I always worry about someone noticing, and it drives me crazy. 

So she sat there, and we continued to talk to eachother, and people around us. I had drank a few beers by this point, so I was starting to feel a little numb. The whole time she was on my lap, I was trying to focus on something, anything else, but my penis was like dude, she's so close to your dick. And I actually wasn't sure if I was erect or not. I mean, I know I wasn't FULLY erect, but wasn't sure about a halfie. After 20 or so minutes, a seat nearby opened up, and she went to it. I had to take a piss, and noticed I had actually cum a little bit. I was mortified. I thought back to wonder if I had been fully erect, and I don't know if it's possible to cum without being fully erect. She had work in the morning, so she went home with friends without saying anything to me, I may have just been gone at the time, or she avoided me. 

Today I had plans to go into to town and hangout with friends. I invited her as well, but she was busy with work, and family things. I went back to her place, where I live, and she came home eventually. She was nice, and initiated small conversations with me, so I don't think I offended her, but can't be sure. She could just be being nice. The reason why I feel bad is I don't want her to think I was trying to get her to sit on my dick, well, I wasn't trying to get off on it. 

She went to her room, probably still awake doing whatever, and I started to wonder if I should talk to her about my possible unwanted move on her.

Sure, she may not have a college education or be the prettiest girl I've ever dated, but she loves me almost unconditionally.

So why do I think about ending it every day!? I have no reasons, except maybe that I want somebody new. 

Everything she does annoys me. I resent her past for being a habitual cheater. She's currently cooking dinner and it's the same thing she always cooks. We never talk about anything except what to eat and how good sex was.

985,2k1h6b,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. I know that his sex drive isn't quite as high as mine, and that sometimes he's too tired, busy, stressed, etc. And I understand that. 

Recently I told him that even though I understand, sometimes I still feel hurt that he doesn't want to have sex. I explained that to me sex is about knowing that we still love each other and find each other attractive, but that most of all it's reconfirming the relationship. He told me that that wasn't how he viewed at all, and that to him it was pretty much just all physical and that he couldn't describe his emotions other than 'good'. 

At first I didn't think much of it, but now whenever we start getting intimate, I have to try to enjoy it. All I can think about is how sex means different things to us, and it hurts. Having sex is, for me, a another way of showing love. That's not what it means to him, and I'm having trouble reconciling both views. I feel used, I guess. We've never had any significant problems in our relationship, so feeling this way is so foreign to me. 

I'm only hesitant about bringing this up with him because I have no idea how to approach it or how to start explaining. I don't want to put him down for feeling this way--I just want to find a good medium for both of us. I don't want to fake anything or lie to him about how I'm feeling either.

43,2v37cg,"My wife and I have been married for 2 years.  This is my 2nd marriage- i have one school aged child that moved in with us a few months ago.  We just had a baby 3 months ago as well, so we now have a full house.

All throughout our relationship, my wife has had major OCDish issues regarding cleaning.   Admittedly,  I do not do things perfectly, but I have tried to conform what I do to make her happy.  As an example, I now measure the food internal temperature when I cook - never did that before. 

The problem is she obsesses about my cleanliness, amplified now that we have a baby.  If I'm going to empty the dishwasher she will, from another room, tell me to wash my hands first.  If I don't wash my hands long enough (I never do- but not intentional), she will make a snide comment.  If a pacifier falls but with the side in the mouth up (so it didn't touch the floor), I have to wash it.   I realize many of these rules are for the baby's safety and I try to follow them as much as I can. however she takes it an extreme.  My point is that I raised a healthy child doing what I do (probably was less clean then  as I do try to meet her cleanliness expectations) .. and to be honest I think my standards of cleanliness are not far off from the average/norm.  

Moreover, she is vey critical and negative.  She doles out criticism far more than compliments/appreciation. I don't to be praised all the time, but some positivity would at least balance out her negtativity.

Her point is that it is a safety issue for the baby or pregnancy. However, even before the baby she made comments constantly about things I do wrong (I wouldn't wash fruit sometimes before I eat it as an example).

The typical scenario is she will make comments and I try to ignore them as best I can.  I try hard to meet her needs on cleanliness- I just try to avoid letting her comments bother me.  However, after 3, 4, or 5 a day I lose it and we fight.  I point out to her that she is creating a wedge in our relationship.. that our fights always stem from this.. and she should consider getting help re: OCD issues (which she admits she has to a mild degree).

As an aside, she is not a perfect person either- nobody is.  I pay the bills (because she would neglect paying them out procrastination).  I cook for us (ironic as it involved me touching her food.. but she works later than I do).  I did the majority of wedding thank you notes because she was too lazy to.. the ones she did, she had her sister come over and help her write them. There were still some she never wrote and now it is too late.  

However, I do these things often without saying anything to her.  I think in a relationship, you need to realize the other person's strengths and weaknesses and help lift them up and fill in area they need help with. So- I pay bills without telling her that she is lazy. I wrote the thank you without complaining.  When we fight I do bring this up - to point out that she should not make an issue out of cleaning everyday.. it makes me feel inferior and picked on- no adult likes to be corrected 3-5x a day.  Again, I know the baby is important, but this predates the baby

We went to therapy briefly after we married due to similar issues.. was somewhat helpful but not really- the therapist just told me to make a joke out of her responses about cleaning or ignore it. I don't think that is helpful.  Moreover, if we are to return to therapy (and we may need to) we need a new therapist as ours just gave birth so I think she will have bias 

I love my wife and she works hard at her job ( I do too) and now is a mom and does a lot for her.  Moreover, my child moved in with us all time and my wife has been great about it.  I thank her but perhaps not enough.  

My question is:  Has anybody been in a similar situation and how have you handled it?  How do you deal with a complaining/negative spouse? Besides therapy, any other approaches to try

Some details as to what's happened in the two months we've lived here:

* My boyfriend's car has been broken into twice and at LEAST two other cars have been broken into once or twice
* One man's car got completely destroyed with a baseball bat (this and the above point both occurred in the double-gated, key fob entry underground garage, so it's almost definitely someone who lives here)
* The storage lockers are consistently getting broken into
* The camera outside the storage locker room has been blacked out with spray paint, and at least one other camera isn't hooked up to anything
* The mailboxes have been broken into twice
* Tonight, at 3am, the fire alarm was set off despite there being no fire

We need help to know what to do with this situation.  Can we legally break this lease without paying?  Should we rally the other residents of the building?  I don't know if this is the right place to ask but we need some advice.

The day after I told my mother before I went to work. When I called my grandparents after work had finished they told me they had already found out through my mother's blog!

I am seriously upset by this, I have asked her before to not post anything about me on her blog and she keeps ignoring my wishes. 
I asked her to remove the post in question and she does not seem to see a problem, said she was only excited for us and wanted to share. I am not even sure whether the post is gone or not (she blogs about me but I can't read it). 

She tries to justify her blog by saying that it's a private blog, but most of my relatives are on there so it does not feel that private to me!

I just feel so bleh about this whole situation. I feel I can't trust her with information anymore. I feel that I have to tell everyone big news (hopefully a pregnancy next year!) before my mum and that's not a nice feeling to have.

311,2gmslu,"i've been with my boyfriend for just over 2 years. i became comfortable early in our relationship with liking girls, and he was very supportive of that, we've even looked into finding threesomes but haven't had much luck since we've been long distance for the past year. 

i used to not get jealous at all, I'd even encourage him to kiss other girls when we were out and stuff, I never worry about him cheating or anything like that. we'd share pictures often of girls from reddit like from r/realgirls or dozens of other subs, and it was fun. I was totally fine with it and fairly secure with myself.

about two months ago, a couple things happened. I've been losing weight for the past couple years, and was pretty happy with how my progress was going until recently. all of a sudden it felt like my boobs disappeared and I looked at videos from only a month earlier (when i still had them) and just wanted to cry. i didn't feel like a woman anymore. 

a few weeks earlier, i was living with my boyfriend and unfortunately felt like snooping one day because he seemed to quickly close tabs when i woke up in the mornings and get really defensive and lie when i asked him about it. i didn't think he was hiding anything remotely serious , i was just curious, and i let him use my phone/computer without any concerns, so at the time I didn't think what i was doing was that bad. i know this was an invasion of his privacy and wasn't cool, but what's done is done. 

i didn't find anything abnormal, but realized that he was watching porn every morning (when i was asleep) which was a surprise because he was almost always in a rush to get to work. also at night after I went to bed. I know all guys look at porn and I didn't expect him not to but i was surprised that he was watching so much when we were banging like 2-3x a day at that point. not only that, but so much of the stuff he looked at were like girls with big huge fake tits and asses or the pictures were photoshopped to look perfect. we've talked about it since and it just sort of makes me sad that he doesn't realize that a lot of what he sees isn't achievable for almost any woman naturally, and he thinks to some extent that many of those girls are just 'lucky'...

anyway, i told him once it made me insecure to know that he was so drawn to girls with big tits and i just felt like I couldn't compare. basically I wanted him to reassure me and tell me that of course I compared and that even though he looked at girls with big boobs, he likes girls of all shapes and sizes, especially me. instead I got: don't worry about it, they're just eyecandy

that hurt a lot to hear. basically instead of saying he loved the way my body looked, it felt like hearing 'big boobs are just fun to look at!' and that i wasn't, but that he loved my body because it was mine (instead of because it was objectively attractive). i wasn't worried about how much he *loved* me, it was how attracted he was to me. made worse by the fact that he's said he misses my big boobs, but that he still loves my little ones (which feels about as great as hearing 'i love your big belly,' as it's coming from someone who very prefers big boobs over small ones). he's tried to make it better but reassuring me just isn't something that comes naturally to him and everything just sounds so fake now that he does try

now we don't really share pictures at all. it sucks because i really like looking at hot girls but I get insecure thinking about how he's probably looking at them too, and knowing they're all hotter than me. it's so fucking stupid and shallow and I wish I could turn it off, trust me, but I can't, not yet anyway.

In vitro is out of the question because it is so expensive. So I would have to be the one to carry the child.

716,1n0qqk,"When we first met (April), I had a girlfriend and she had a boyfriend. Our relationship was platonic for only a short while; soon our mutual attraction was apparent. 

Even before I met her, my relationship with my girlfriend was going downhill.
About a month after we became close friends, she and her boyfriend were done. He was exchanging far away, as was she. She said that they never really expected to attempt the long-distance effort.

Around two weeks after her breakup, I ended things with my girlfriend. I probably would have even if I had not met her, but she was certainly a catalyst.
We jokingly suggested that we should have a summer fling (now June) and not have any pressure when she leaves for her exchange (early August).
 
She was clearly less conservative than I was. She told me that during her year-long relationship with her ex, she made out with three guys (three separate incidents). He scolded her for them but forgave her without too much unhappiness.

We were soon spending more time together than apart. She meant the world to me. She called me boyfriend on several occasions and told me that she loved me. I had never been happier.

Soon it was time for her to leave (early August). I gave her an amazing, extremely thoughtful gift. We hugged and kissed goodbye but it wasn't as passionate as I hoped because her mother was also present (lol...).

We Skyped everyday. We were six hours apart. I would wake up at or stay up until 5AM every day to Skype her. She was lonely at first, but soon made friends. We exchanged I miss you 's and I love you 's often. 

We had some small fights. She'd agree to Skype at a certain time and then not show up. This was frustrating because I was awake at 5AM for her. In just about every argument, I was the one to take a step back.

Gradually she became distant. She'd take hours to reply to my Facebook messages after she had seen them. She no longer referred to me as honey and my expressions of love were rarely returned. We no longer Skype everyday.

We were discussing the nature of our relationship. She said she couldn't tell me whether she wanted a boyfriend/girlfriend status because she was uncertain if she'd be able to be completely loyal to me due to her more open nature.

A few days ago, she told me that she feels restricted most of the time because she knows that I am conservative. She also said that because we've only spent two months together, she doesn't think about or care for me as much as I'd like her to; distance makes a difference for her.
I asked her if there's anything she wanted to do but didn't due to her feeling of restriction; she replied no.

I suggested that we don't communicate for a week so we may think about what we feel and what we want. She agreed. We will Skype this Friday.

What do I do, guys? I love this girl a lot and I've done so much for her... is it time to call it quits?
I guess I should have asked her to be my girlfriend before she left?

342,25fc04,"Over the last few weeks, I've been pondering the impending end to my first long term relationship. I'm feeling lonely, scared, depressed, and yet paradoxically relieved, and I don't know how to deal with these emotions. Warning - this long and whiny story is definitely within the category of first world relationship problems, and I also realized after writing it that I don't even really have a question, but I thought - what the hell, I can't sleep anyway, might as well write it down, put it in a glass bottle and throw it out there into the waves of the metaverse and see who finds it. Here's the story. 


I met C in the late summer of 2011. It was an amazing summer - I was single, free from school, getting ready to go on an amazing trip, and just spending time with my friends in the city. Background: I'm a pretty talkative person, but shy on the inside, and I don't click with people easily. Dated on and off for about 5 years, but never really connected with anyone. And then one night, while out at a club with some friends, I met C. Visiting from a city 4500km (a 5 hr plane ride) away, what was supposed to be a one night stand turned into an e-mail/IM exchange, and eventually coalesced into plans to meet up again. 


A month of chatting later, we hang out for a few short days in NYC. It was a hilarious trip - we both get really sick from norwalk virus, and spend it taking care of each other - a far fling from the romantic fun weekend we had planned. Chatting continues, and a month later, I visit him in his city, and we decide to try and officially date. Don't do it! You're just setting yourself up for tears, and a lot of money down the drain! my friend told me. But through the momentum of love, I didn't care. After-all, here was someone I finally connected with on that exciting level. Wasn't it worth giving it a shot? 


I visit again in January, and it is the most amazing trip ever. C takes me camping and shows me awesome things. I am having the time of my life, and I have never been happier. However, this is when the first cloud appeared. I'm taking a photo on his phone, and accidentally open facebook, forgetting it's not my account. I see a message that he's exchanged with someone that has some sketchy words in it, and I make the mistake of reading it. Turns out he's exchanging dirty photos with someone. I'm heart broken, and in shock - I could not imagine this caring awesome person would do this to me. When confronted, he's actually not completely remorseful and somewhat defensive. Says things like I'm sure you have sketchy stuff on your phone as well...eventually, he apologizes grudgingly.


Long distance relationships are tough - you can't work through things properly, and resentment builds up. C is not a good communicator - he gets defensive and is stubborn. The incident in January really tore me up, especially because C didn't actually seem to express that he was doing anything wrong. But, I eventually rationalize that this sort of stuff happens in the gay community (and apparently the straight community as well, from all the posts I've read) all the time, and I was just naiive. I tried to let it slide. 


But without me knowing it, I begin to get controlling - I get annoyed when he 'likes' pictures of other guys on facebook. I get pissed when he adds guys as friends. I start wondering what other shady relationships he has, and it puts a strain on things. I can feel myself suffocating him, and it becomes the cause of many fights, but eventually, slowly, bit by bit, I reign it in. It takes time, but I slowly learn to let things slide, not to question him where he's going, be easier going, and I realize it's a good thing for our relationship.


Half a year later around September 2012, things are going well, but C ends up meeting someone named H at an event. I ask him about H (because I'm still not quite out of my controlling phase) and he tells me that he's just some random guy. C does mention to me that H is planning to join him and his friends for a camping trip in November. I decide to not make a big deal out of it because I'm trying to learn to be less controlling.


C comes to visit me in October, and he's getting tons of text messages from someone. I find out it's H. I'm disappointed. All the horribleness from January starts coming back into my head. I end up doing the unspeakable: I snoop through his facebook, and I see messages between him and H. They are definitely of the flirtatious nature, and I eventually catch a message in which C says You'd better think of things to talk about while we're in bed together ;) I'm devastated. I confront C, but he turns it around and blows up at me for snooping. He tells me it was just a joke, and wasn't going to happen, and how could I possibly doubt that he cared about me if he was willing to fly 5 hours to come see me for a week. I end up caving, because I don't know how to deal with this, and just try and forget about it. 


I'm going to zoom forward because this is getting too long and detailed. Over the next year and half, I try to get myself to trust C. I tell myself that mistrusting him will ruin the relationship. In part, this is partly because he has turned the whole thing upside down, and I am the bad guy for snooping in the first place. I am depressed, but can't bring myself to break up with him. Also,since I had made a promise to not snoop anymore, I don't actually find any new reasons to get upset. The lack of trust gnaws at me, but when I bring it up, I get shut down for starting problems. I try really hard to move on, and eventually it gets brushed under the carpet, and things are going pretty well - I meet his parents and family, he meets mine, there's talk of moving etc...


January of 2014, I end up finding out that H and C have been having weekly sleep overs together for the last 6 months. Naked sleep overs. I'm devastated, but in a weird way, I feel a surreal relief: After months and months of agonizing over whether or not he was cheating on me, I find out that the worst has actually happened. In a weird twisted way, it felt good knowing that I didn't have to lie to myself anymore, because it was true and had already happened. 


He is apologetic, but says that it's tough being so far away, and that H essentially acted as a surrogate boyfriend, because I wasn't there. He tells me that he knows that what he did was wrong, but he also tells me not to be so upset about it, that I need to let loose and be more laid back about this kind of stuff, because we couldn't just so many rules in our relationship, being 4000km apart. He tells me that he obviously loves and cares about me, otherwise he wouldn't have invited me to spend time with his family, and he tells me that he'll stop because he wants what we have to work out. 


Reading this myself, I am gobsmacked that I decided to continue with this relationship, and I'm sure at this point, the shit will start flying at me from all the readers who have stuck with me up to this point. For those of you who have had this happen, maybe you can understand a little bit how tricky it is. I felt that I had built up an emotional dependance on this person, and I honestly believe(d) that it would hurt more to end it than to deal with what had happened and try and work through it. Nonetheless, we talk, and decide to make 2014 a fresh start. At this point, I am so used to just forgiving him, suppressing things and telling myself that I should just learn to let go that it isn't even hard, in that moment, to let go and tell myself that we can work through it.


We both recognize that we've reached a point where the long distance thing is no longer working. We hang out a lot from January - March, and it's great: he is loving, and caring. However, I know that part of it is because he is mainly with me and therefore doesn't have a chance to hang out with H behind my back. We start talking about plans to somehow live together. Unfortunately, in March, I receive the devastating news that I will be moving to a small tiny town in the middle of nowhere for the next 5 years. I won't go into details - it's a legal binding contract, and essentially dictates the rest of my professional career.


So, this is it. C tells me he would be willing to move if there were job opportunities - initially this made me feel ecstatic that he would actually leave the city for me, and gave me some affirmation that he truly cared about me...but after looking for a month, nothing has shown up. We've set a deadline for June, and it's so strange - part of me is dreading that date, and part of me really just wants it to come. Finally, I'll be able to free myself from the torture of loving someone who has betrayed my trust. I won't need to constantly reassure myself (aka lie to myself). On the other hand, I don't know what I'll do without all the things he's been for me over the last 3 years. It really rips me up inside - it's like this horrible drug that I'm addicted to and can't give up. 


Anyway, I think I'm done. Ugh. After reading what I've written, I realize I sound like a whiny little bitch. I also realize I don't really have a question, except that I don't know what to do with all these horrible conflicting emotions, and I'm also hoping that some people who have gone through this hellish experience can empathize. I know much more awful things happen to people out there (fiancées who cheat, married people cheating), so if you're seething with irritation right now, I apologize!! But then again, if you're browsing the relationship subreddit at 1am and actually read this whole thing, then I guess it wasn't that bad of a story.

OK so to explain some things.  I've been talking to this girl in my Community college since the beginning of this semester.  We used to be pretty awkward in our convos (sometimes I start the convo and sometimes she does) but the week before spring break i asked her if we can study together for a test we have coming up, she agreed and while I was walking her to her car we seemed to have a pretty smooth, flowing conversation so I think maybe we just suck in public.

So what happened in Spring break was I texted her about maybe studying sometime soon.  She said something on the lines of  my family was coming over this time of the week so she probably cant meet up :(   She did tell me she had family coming over break so it seemed legitimate too

I said that's cool and just said I hope you have fun with your family and left it at that

Now what I'm wondering is should I just resume our normal conversation or maybe ask her for lunch sometime?  I'm wondering this because I think I might seem to start pestering her and I don't want to annoy her or anything

Also, i dunno if this matters much but our class had two weeks to switch seats because the prof was going to make us have assigned seats but we had two weeks to prepare.  We both sat next to each other and didn't switch seats.  She's also home schooled so i think she's maybe as shy as me but i dunno since she generally participates in class discussions

I think the thing that's scaring me is I'm overweight and while I have had progress in losing weight, Im thinking she doesn't like me or anything as she is actually pretty attractive and fit unlike me.

What situation exactly? My friend's apartment has a pretty juvenile tradition in which you have to kiss X amount of people according to your Xth birthday.  Typical college freshmen stuff, love or hate it.

Context:

We met about 6 months ago and from the get-go, the tension between us was palpable. Like, bad enough for her to reconsider her (at the time) 2 month relationship.  But they've still been dating, and **excluding the one time I took her on a casual brunch date when they went on a break**, we've kept things clean and stayed completely as friends.

Problem:

I know without a doubt that during her upcoming birthday, she will want to kiss me for game/tradition.  I don't know how I feel about this, since by itself, I don't see any issues.  But given how much attraction is between us, it seems vaguely like cheating?    I mean, it'll be nothing more than a peck on the lips, but I don't know...

If I don't want to go through with it, how would I politely decline her advance (besides the normal 'no')?  Bare in mind, it'll be a party situation, so no deep conversations or whatnot.

Thanks for the advice on something that's pretty juvenile.

Fast forward two years, and we are in a spot where we call each other friend more often then not but I always catch her glancing at me when we are in group hang outs, wanting to stand next to me and we do the usual teasing and what not.

This week  we got into an argument over the fact that she thought I had to tell her something of concern when in reality I just didn't know that Tina Fey is white (I know, I live under a rock). In anycase, she told me she was concerned about me but then upon realizing my pop culture ineptitude, she just got angry/upset at me. We didn't speak anymore after that.

982,1xpox1,"I've never had a real boyfriend or dated anyone long term. There is a guy at my university that I have had a crush on for a few years but never acted on it until a friend convinced me to ask him on a date. Whenever we try to talk, it is usually a bit awkward, unless our mutual friends are around, then we're pretty much the ONLY ones talking. We get along well when we are not both being standoffish. His friends swear he is not as aloof as he acts, that he's just shy.

 Anyways, so, I ask him on this date and he said yes. It went very well, we talked for over 3 hours, it was like we had been good friends for years. I have heard from other girls who have been on dates with him (yeah, its a small university. We all know each other too much) that he is very awkward and they tend to be the one holding up conversation the whole time. Well, on our date there was no awkwardness, no long pauses, but (possibly unfortunately), purely casual and friendly. But that's alright, I'm actually fine with being lumped into the friendzone, I just really enjoy his company. I don't need to date, even though I think it could be fun. We found we had a TON in common, and we seemed to both thoroughly enjoy one another's company. He told me afterwards that he had a terrific time and that we should do it again sometime.


Aaaaand now for the awkward. See, since i asked him on the initial date, I'm trying really hard not to mess this up and seem too interested. The moment he agreed to a date, I stopped pursuing. The whole hard-to-get, 'make him make the next move' thing. Its been a week and we have not spoken. We have run into each other on campus and didn't talk, make eye contact, say hello, and I think even may have been avoiding each other. Naturally, I would say he has no inteterest in me. But considering his friends swear that's just sort of how he is when he's shy, its possible that we have the same defense mechanism to avoid unless approached, which is....tricky. Should I be the one to approach him again and break the ice again if he is just being shy, or should I just assume he is not interested and leave him alone? Should I just bite the bullet and see if he wants to go on a second date this weekend, or should I just assume that if he wanted to, he would have asked?

912,2nerdx,"Hi everyone. I've lurked here a bit, but now I find myself with a problem, and the resulting post. I apologize in advance for the length.

I thought my boyfriend was a sweet, wonderful, amazing guy. I didn't think he was perfect, but possibly perfect for me.

He has done several things to show me he loves me, cares for me, etc.

We are going through an icky spot in our relationship. It's long distance, which both of us normally don't do, but he's so out of this world I decided to make an exception for him.

It's been hard, for sure, but I've been surprisingly ok with it. Him, not so much.

If I can't talk to or Skype him as much as he wants, he gets very upset. He's not very understanding if I get extra busy with work or school, and gets jealous and suspicious more and more frequently I am going on dates or cheating on him.

I can absolutely understand some of his frustrations, and I've done everything I can to prove I love him and am trustworthy. It's surprising though, he's normally quite stoic and logical, and I'm the one with my heart on my sleeve and I practically ooze feelings. And yet he's having a harder time with the long distance than I am.

I am also a person who's love language is words. I take words very much to heart. Compliments make me feel on Cloud 9. Critiscism crushes me. I'm going to therapy to work on my over sensitivity and self esteem, and getting better, but I remain a sensitive individual. 
My boyfriend Roger knows this.

Anyways, last night my phone died (I gave Roger a head's up my phone was on it's last legs) and I couldn't find my charger. I was pretty distraught, but since I have a big trip for Thanksgiving coming up and I had to pack, I simply spent my evening packing and went to bed very early.

I woke up this morning and went to work. After a quick search I found my charger. I had misplaced it and accidentally packed it along with some clothes and other technical equipment.

I plugged my phone in at the office and after it turned on I recived a couple texts from Roger asking where I was and then suddenly a text that said **You're a shit.**

Maybe I'm over reacting again, because I've been in a few abusive relationships that have required some serious therapy to get over. But this kind of pushed me over the edge.
One of the reasons I fell in love with this man is because he is sweet, kind, thoughtful and I thought had no potential to be abusive.

Now he has resorted to calling me bad names. I took a bathroom break to call him and was crying and he said:

 What are you gonna cry now? Geez you're so fucking sensitive. Grow up. What is wrong with you? Welcome to real fucking life where people swear. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK. Get over it ____. You're living in a fucking fantasy land. I can't believe you seriously have a problem with it. I called you a name. Deal with it. That's what couples do. They fight and they call each other names. That's what happens.

I just responded I've been furious with him and I'd never dream of calling him names. And that divorce is normal these days and that doesn't make it right. We argued some more and I was finally crying too hard to talk and said I had to get back to work.

I'm now seriously reconsidering the relationship. I've been in so many abusive ones, and I don't want to get in yet another one, but I don't want my sensitivity to be a problem.

I just don't think healthy couples should call each other names. I don't think I'm being sensitive, to me it's a serious sign of a lack of respect and maturity. All my exes called me horrible names, and it took me awhile to get it through my head that I didnt deserve it.

My boyfriend thinks I'm over reacting. He's trying to apologize but making the excuse I lose my head and I'm sorry. You can't take what I say to heart when I get upset.

But I'm thinking does that mean I can slap him when I lose my temper and he can't take THAT to heart? I'm not exactly accepting his apology this time and it's pissing him off, he says I'm being spiteful.

I communicated that I'm very hurt and upset by what he said and feel terribly disrespected and I'm having a hard time accepting his apology when it's is becoming more and more common for him to lose his cool.

He says he's never been like this, blames it on his ex-wife (who honestly really was abusive to him in every way possible, a real witch), etc. It's just starting to sound like excuses.

Apparently that makes me spiteful.

I do feel terrible for the horror he went through with his ex-wife, but if I'm terrrible, why would he want to be with me? I'm doing my best to be a good gf, and I've definitely made mistakes, but not enough to warrant this outpouring of total RAGE.

Am I being too sensitive because of my past? I think it's terrible for couples to call each other names, and coupled with him mocking me for being hurt and saying all couples do it, I'm now seriously considering breaking it off.

Or it is normal and I just need to suck it up and get over it?

I think I'd be fine being single forever though if couples fight like that. I don't think fighting shouldn't exist, I think all healthy couples have arguments, but I think they can be resolved in calm ways without resorting to violence, name calling or over-the-top aggression.

Sorry for rambling. I'm honestly pretty broken and shook up and feeling like this person isn't who I thought he was. Or that I'm just a sensitive-Susie-walking-train-wreck-basket case who should just stay single.

Please be gentle Reddit. If I'm wrong, please tell me but in a constructive way. I'm in a bad spot right now. I just want to do the right thing and get my head straight.

364,2ro87w,"There are not too many people in town who play my favorite sport (volleyball). I can't really avoid these folks without just not playing anymore.

There are a few people around my age (mid-20s) while most of the others are men in their 40's and 50's who have been playing for years.

For the past two years they have all been perfectly friendly. Some of them have kids around my age. So I've interacted with them the same way that I'm used to interacting with my friend's parents. We play volleyball together but do not really socialize outside of that.

This all changed when my 25 year old friend Emily started dating one of them, Walter. He is close to 60 with white hair. Emily has told me straight up she is with Walter because of having daddy issues. She likes it that he's a father figure and she feels taken care of. They make out in public and strangers get shocked and stare because they look like grandfather and granddaughter. However I support her doing what she wants.

The problem is now his buddies are flirting with ME! I felt bad for Emily because our other friends do not really want to socialize with Walter so I agreed to go out for Mexican food with them.

Well one of Walter's friends came along who we play volleyball with (Bill). And the whole time he acted as if we were on a double date!! He stuck to my side like glue and was in my face monopolizing my attention the whole time. I was extemely uncomfortable.

Then another time I went out with just Emily, and I guess she told Walter where we were because he showed up with Bill and the same thing happened again.

Now every time I see Bill, while playing volleyball he's super excited to come over to me and wants to give me big hugs and talk to me. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and I don't want special treatment from him whatsoever.

And it's not just him, Bill is the most gung-ho about it, but several of the other men have been doing the same thing, showing me extra attention and interest, going out of their way to say hi to me, giving me flirty smiles and winks etc.

I feel grossed out and disgusted because these men are the age of my parents and I have give them NO reason to believe I would have any romantic interest in them whatsoever.

All I want is to play volleyball and for them to go back to treating me like member of a younger generation, their kid's generation. I don't want any special attention from them.

Do you think there is anything I can do in this situation to make this stop without alienating people or quitting volleyball?

132,3d2pck,"So, I found this girl from class at my university.  I called her hot girl from art class to my friends because I kept thinking about her.  Let's call her Mary.  Long story short, I was into a girl prior to meeting Mary, and I was basically shot down.  I then went on to date Mary and the previous girl, let's call her Jenny, started coming onto me and I stooped as low as any person could, and dumped Mary to start dating Jenny.  Mary was incredible. Easily the best girl friend I have ever had or known, but I left her because I couldn't say no to Jenny.  I was weak.

Fast forward a year or so and I brake up with Jenny for various reasons.  I should have known that a girl who only became interested through jealousy was not one worth my time.  Regardless, it ended rough and after a few weeks I wanted to end things on a good note so I talked to Jenny and everything ended up being okay.  That same night, I figured why not, and told Mary about why I really left her and what the whole story really was.  This was not meant for her to feel sorry for me or anything, but it was always in the back of my mind that I needed to get off my chest because I had felt regret ever since.

Cut to current day---roughly 4 months after being single from Jenny, I have been talking to someone new.  I have a hard time telling if I really like this new girl, or I just like having someone to talk to (it is a problem I am working on).  Regarding Mary, she would snap chat me/text me somewhat regularly.  For instance, just about every morning when she got to work I would get a snap or two from her without me prompting anything.  We were even best friends on snapchat for a week or so before I backed off and tried to assess what was going on between us. When Mary messages me rather than snapchats me, the conversations would get pretty deep sometimes.

We would play a type of question game where she would ask me something along the lines of Do you remember that time we made dinner for xxxx?  What did we make?  Just things that were obvious hints to when we were together, as if trying to get me to think about us together back then.  She also posts things on instagram/facebook with those quotes that are hinting towards a specific person.  For instance Never underestimate the power of good morning texts, apologies, and random compliments,  was one of her tweets. Another one was a picture (trying to really make this one shorter than the real quote) Empty your mind...Confess it all to me...Tell me your favorite food, drink, movie, color...I want to burn your responses into my memory.  I've never known love or life or pain or release until I met you.  I think she may be referring to me, but who really knows?

I am completely open minded here, I do not want to assume this is about me, however I still have feelings for Mary because I left in a really bad way and only because I liked someone else a little bit more, but I was still, you know, into her.  I was in a bad spot in my life and it's something that I never want to do anyone ever again.  It fills me with regret and just imaging what I put Mary through really upsets me. She never posted these types of things before we became friends again (roughly 4 months ago), which kind of just confuses me a bit more.  It is hard for me at this point, to tell if I really like her, or if I just desire her. I do not want to make the mistake again, but I will never be able to get the thought of what if if we ended up giving it another shot. 

So, Reddit.  what are your thoughts on the situation?  It seems like Mary wants to try things again.  But I do not know if it is the right choice for me, her, or if that is even what she wants.

We're now in second year and living together off-campus with three other roommates. Two of these roommates are basically just acquaintances that we needed to fill our house and the other one is a friend.

Anyways, Peter met a guy in August that he started casually seeing until early October when they became exclusive. Peter's boyfriend lives in a city that is two and a half hours away from our university. They used to alternate visiting each other, with Peter going to the city one weekend and his boyfriend coming to visit Peter the next weekend. Since January, his boyfriend has only visited once and Peter now goes to the city every single weekend, usually leaving Thursday afternoon and not coming home until Monday morning, sometimes even going there on Wednesday.


I was totally fine with this at first, but I have become extremely lonely as he spends more of his time in the city. My other roommates are barely around, which I don't really mind, but it hurts when my best friend continuously chooses to visit his boyfriend, while I'm stuck at home alone. I have other friends and I go out with them on the weekends, but it is just not the same without Peter. 

When he is at home, he is usually in class and we barely have time to hang out since I have other commitments during my school week. I just wish he could put some effort into our relationship, as we are supposedly best friends.

I've brought it up to Peter several times and he knows that I'm lonely and sad. Peter says that since he is spending half his week here, he is fairly dividing half of his time with his friends and half of his time with his boyfriend. He also says he doesn't like spending time in our house (our other roommates are insanely messy) and that he shouldn't have to justify visiting his boyfriend. 

I guess I'm just wondering if I have any right to feel this way. Am I being really selfish? Am I too invested in this relationship? I'm still young and immature and I just want to know if I should be feeling this way or if I'm being unreasonable. I definitely wouldn't have lived with him if I had known he wouldn't be around.

1089,2w5esi,"I started going through a breakup back in September of last year.  It broadsided me as I did not realize she was so unhappy and detached that she would simple drop everything and just be gone with a new boyfriend before the ink was dry on her new lease.  The last time I went through this I was devastated for years.  I really did not think that anyone would necessarily understand my heartache but I ended up in /r/relationships not long after.

Through reading all your own stories and finding the similarities to my own I have been able to understand how much or little this was in my control and be more capable of accepting things as they are and not as I wished them.  I have come to realize that I have to put some things, even good memories, behind me so I can be open to the happy things I have each new day.

It is a few months later and while I still have a stray painful/happy memory now and then I do not dwell on them.  I have reinvested in myself and the difference is already apparent to others in my life.  I am stronger and healthier than I have been in a decade.  I have regained lost hobbies.  I see my good friends more.  Most importantly, to me, I do not feel hate in my heart for what has happened.

82,2zs2zt,"So I work with this girl and have asked her out twice so far. The first time she told me she didn't want to start a relationship due to her being busy with school and her being almost an hour apart, afyet we went on one date too. So okay I thought it was over especially when she started to date one of her long time friends. They started dating during winter break and her new school schedule gave her a lot of flexibility. A few weeks ago they broke up.

Ever since then she would flirt with me at work a lot, even more than before, and even bought me coffee. She would spark up a lot on conversations with me and we hit it off great again. So I figured I'd go for it, and I was expecting a yes or no answer. Well apparently I was wrong... their breakup wasn't the greatest and now they aren't even friends anymore. When I asked her out I feel like I said all the right things but she basically told me since the break up was pretty bad she's just not ready to start anything.

Now I get it, she basically said no without saying no but I feel like it kinda leaves it up in the air a little bit. I told her if she ever changes her mind that she has my number. The thing I can't get over is if she wasn't interested in dating me why wouldn't she just say that and make up an excuse, especially twice. I don't want to keep thinking we can go out if we can't but she has never said I just don't like you like that or anything like that. Note that she has said I just like you as a friend to someone else I know.

TL;DR; I asked out a girl from work again who at first didn't want to date because of long distance.

140,30vlu8,"**TL; DR: Was on and off 12-16, got fed up over time that we couldn't be friends and only came to each other in times where we didn't want to go to anyone else (because we feel really close to each other), so I cut her out of my life due to toxicity of being a safety net. Later I ran into her, and we talked for an hour which lead to a hang out where I realized I still love her.**

I'll add more later. Sorry for long title.

Basis: As explained in the title we fell in love at a very young age. She realized we couldn't last til adulthood because you know-11[f] 12[m].  We both were and kind if are crazy. She got into drugs and sex and partying. I was super against and lost close friends (mutual people who partied with her).

Over the years following until I was 16.5[m] we would on and off date. Every time ending in disaster because of lives being so different. Every time we were in extreme emotional turmoil she would contact me or vice versa. Then when we were fine we would stop talking to each other.

Fast forward years later where we maybe talked once a year we finally agree that we want to talk. I cave in and go talk to her when my gf (of the time) were having problems so I could get advice. We instantly feel chemistry and there's sexual/emotional tension (I never had sex with her but we always had attraction to one another). She was in a 2 year relationship I had been in a 3.5 one so I felt it was safe to talk.

We agreed had we known how to be adults about our problems that we could have worked. She agreed to hang but kept flaking. I got annoyed and directly asked why she always bails. She admitted she was worried if falling in love with me (I felt that was silly since we were in relationships for so long).

I cut her out and block her on social media explaining I can't do that anymore because of not wanting to be a safety and We were toxic to each others lives. She wasn't happy about it but we stopped talking for a while.

Fast forward. My GF (now 4.5 years) and I break up. So do her and her BF.

We ran into each other at a restaraunt the other day and I waved. She texted me and asked to talk outside. After talking for an hour my friends come out saying how we need to go. She says we should talk another time.

A few weeks go by of her flaking from hanging out. I tell her that I am taking it we won't actually hang. She says no that she really wants to but is just busy.

So we set another day. Which was the day I made this post. We go and hang out. Have dinner. Talk a bit. Walk around the small town. I wasn't talking that much because lately I feel I shave lost a piece of myself. She noticed a few times and asked what was wrong but I explained I didn't want to talk about it.

I realize I still love her, and would love if we could work things out. Sadly since she's slept with a lot of people I know and one of my best friends I feel stupid. I also don't want to be taken advantage of.

I explain at the end of our hang out that I'm sorry I wasn't totally myself (because me and her know each other on a very deep level and she knows me really well even after all this time). She jokes and asks if she makes me uncomfortable. I say no, and had even stated earlier that if anything I was trying not to let myself feel as comfortable as I did feel with her. I respond and say that some shit happened recently that just messed with me...

I then  tell her: I'm broked. So that's why I'm not myself.

She made a disappointed look and says you wait until the end to say this??

I told her I don't want to talk about that. She brings up that that's what We do, and who we are.

I responded semi-sternly I don't want us to be that way anymore. I don't want to go to each other for problems.

She inquired why. I said it wasn't a good idea for me to answer at the time.

I'm afraid telling her I love her will give her too much room to take advantage and also I wanted to be friends with her. I wanted to be able to hang out and enjoy each others company. Now that I realized I actually have feelings for he'd after all these years I don't know what to do.

So far I'm tempted to block her on social media again. Tell her I still love her and that because I don't think it will turn into that, that it would hurt too much to want to hang out and be friends when it seems she won't actually do so, and even if she loved me we likely wouldn't work...

Advice please? Should I just cut her out and do the smart thing by saving myself from situaituation? Or talk to her about it to see what she feels towards me, and risk being heartbroken?

983,2vifxa,"Me and my GF have been together for 6 months now.  Everything is amazing between us and I trust her completely.  But her ex boyfriend scares me.



They were together for 3 years, but she tells me that she never really loved him, it was just her first ever relationship as a teenager.  They broke up 3 years ago, got back together a few months later, then broke up for good soon after.  A few weeks after this, he **showed up at her house** unannounced to apologize for the way he acted during their second breakup.  She tells me she stood her ground, talked to him a little bit but was firm in letting him know that it was over, and he left, presumably on good terms.  That was the last time they talked.



Come Christmas, he sent her a merry christmas PM on FB.  Then come New Years, he sent her another message.  She didn't reply to either, and the second message prompted her to block him on FB.  She didn't tell me about this until a few weeks ago, but I think she handled it very well.  I asked why they were still FB friends in the first place, she said it just slipped her mind until then.  That's fine, she handled it well imo.



The thing is, the event that prompted her to tell me all of these details about her previous relationship is that one of her friends told her that her ex had contacted them, asking for my GF's current phone number.  That's obviously fucking weird.  She didn't give him it (obviously!!)  A few days later, her mom (who's still FB friends with ex-bf) told my GF that she had received a long message from ex-bf.  





The message said something like Hey, I miss you all so much, I have an announcement to make and I will see you guys soon! (she lives with her mom.)  This seems to imply that he's gonna randomly show up at their house... again.  I immediately said well this guy pretty obviously wants to get back with you and I think you need to be careful.  I'm not worried that she'd cheat, but I am worried about this guys creepy, stalkerish behavior.


Her reaction was really negative, she thinks I'm being paranoid and she said that her ex bf is a human being who probably just wants to tell some people he knew something important about his life.   She told me she knows how to handle it and that she's not going to avoid him if he does show up (which I told her she needed to do.)   She was really bothered by how I construed his intentions and I dropped it because I didn't want to make her feel bad about something that, as of yet, is seemingly really benign. 



But she has no contact with this guy at all and he's trying pretty desperately to contact her through her friends and family and that's pretty stalkery if you ask me.  I'm pretty concerned that this might escalate.  Am I right to be?

726,2sirqn,"Once I got to college I realized I suddenly had a series of new friends who greatly alter their behavior around the girls they date. For example, say my friend in the title (26 M) is dating a woman (23 F). Those two individuals, myself, and several other mutual friends are hanging out. In this scenario he may (and does) decide to greatly opt out of conversations he would otherwise relish in. In many cases these aren't even controversial conversations, but perhaps something he has decided his significant other (SO) isn't interested in? Or something else? It's easy to ask Why would someone alter their behavior for their SO? but at this stage it seems more then that because he seems to be in auto-pilot when she is around AND there are other friends around.

Ultimately I am confused by this type of behavior and always have been. I'd like to hear the other side of things without asking either of them, for the purpose of understanding my friends and learning of course. In my own past experiences I either identified that I have enough in common with a woman that I don't have to hide my own behavior / avoid various topics, or I simply let it go. I definitely don't expect anyone to change their social habits for me (not saying 23 F does here necessarily). It seems like way too large of a task to censor myself the 30-90% of my free time I spend with the woman I'm dating. I mean  shouldn't I have enough in common to begin with where I feel there is no reason to do so?

Can anyone refute what I am saying? Genuinely interested in someone with experience changing their own behavior for others. But to be clear I'm not talking about oh he never takes out the trash! and then he begins taking out the trash. I'm talking personality and social experiences.

Almost exactly a year ago, a 7-month relationship came to an end, amicably. We were both moving away from the city where we lived, and neither of us were keen to do long-distance. The relationship felt like it had run its course anyway.

On the last night we saw each other before heading our separate ways, he (let's call him John) told me he loved me. He didn't say it as a attempt to get us to stay together; he said it as part of his goodbye, like, I just wanted you to know. I didn't feel quite the same way about him, so I didn't reciprocate. Instead I told him I cared about him and had really enjoyed our time together. 

John suggested the following (in his words): If, the next time we see each other, you think there's a chance (for us to sleep together, get back together, I don't know?), we go for drinks. If there's no chance, you insist on coffee. 

Basically, a code so he would know where I stood without having to ask me (and possibly get rejected).

I said fine.

We parted on good terms.

In the 12 months since then, I haven't seen John at all, but we have kept in very casual contact -- an email every couple of months, one or two short but friendly conversations via Skype, etc. 

We've both been traveling a lot this fall, and it turns out, we're going to be in the same city at the same time next week -- overlapping for one night. He's single; I'm single. 

I'd love to see him and catch up. And... I wouldn't say no to some sex if the evening wore that way -- the sex used to be great, and it'd be fun. However, I'm *not* interested in getting back together, and I don't want to mislead him.

Is that selfish of me? Should I stick to our agreement instead, insist on meeting for coffee, and completely shut down the possibility of anything physical? I don't even know if he remembers that agreement.

I also don't know his current feelings for me -- maybe he's totally over it and would be just fine with an NSA evening.

We've always been very direct with each other, and I wouldn't have a problem telling him: Hey, I'm down for some fun tonight if you are, but just as a one-time thing. But I'm basically just afraid I'm being selfish and/or insensitive, here.

967,1ncyac,"I met my roommate (T) last August on World of Warcraft, we hit it off right away, started flirting and chatting very regularly. We spent several hours every day talking on ventrillo about all kinds of things. There was an obvious sexual attraction between us right away that seemed to build over time. In December I drove 600 miles to meet her, we spent a week together and had sex 6 of the 7 days I was there. 

When I returned home from my first visit she made a very difficult decision to take a semester of medical leave from school. Her uncle that was paying for her education and most of her living expenses cut her off when she made this decision. She suddenly needed a way to cover her rent and other living expenses. I came for a second visit approximately 6 weeks after my first. This second trip lasted a week as well, and we again had sex several times. She knew that I was quite taken with her, beyond just wanting sex. I asked her if she wanted me to stay. She told me that she couldn't ask me to do that at the time, because it would be too sudden and unplanned.

After my second trip I returned home and began making plans to move to MA. I searched for a job and applied to several places. I got a few interviews and quit on good terms, my job, making the drive one last time to MA. This time I was prepared to stay and begin what I thought would be a relationship. Everything went well for the first few weeks, I felt like we had picked up where we left off and things were great. After that brief period however, things began to gradually cool, she became more and more distant and uncommunicative. 

When I arrived my job offers fell through, I frantically searched for another job and luckily found a good one that was actually a better fit for me than the ones I thought I had lined up, so that was a win. My relationship with T had changed though. During my first couple of weeks here we had sex a few times, but one morning she came out and sat next to me, crying. She said that this wasn't what she wanted and that she was forcing herself to do it, that she couldn't do it any more. I was a bit taken aback, since I thought we were moving forward with a relationship, but I expressed understanding and willingness to be patient. 

It has now been 5 months since I moved in, and things with her still feel like they're in a state of limbo. Some days she is quite affectionate and flirtatious. She'll grind against me and touch me in very sexual ways, then suddenly turn cold and remind me that she has no interest in actually having sex. This has been going on for months now, though we have had sex a few times in the interim, she always returns to saying she has no interest in a relationship. I just don't know if I can continue like this. I feel sometimes like she wants the benefits of being in a relationship without feeling a need to make any kind of real commitment to one. I do a majority of the shopping, cooking, and cleaning of the one bedroom apartment we share. I also sleep on the couch while she has her bedroom and queen sized bed to herself. I am struggling to distance myself from her a bit, because this situation feels like it has become untenable. I have always been very affectionate and I fall hard and fast. I often find myself drawn to her, offering massages and to get her anything she desires. I frequently end up making her drinks, buying her beer and giving her neck and shoulder rubs. I don't dislike performing these activities, however I feel as if I should cease them if I want to move on myself. 

I really want my relationship with my roommate to work out, but at this point I'm afraid that it just can't. We came into it on very different levels of expectation. My feelings for her have gone UN-reciprocated for this long and I fear that she may never develop feelings for me. I'm struggling to break my habit of doing whatever she asks simply because she asked me to. I just want to have a mature relationship but am unable to resist her advances when she does decide she wants more from me. T and I also have very different levels of sex drive, I am quite driven, while she claims to be unintersted most of the time, however I hear her almost nightly masturbating when she has gone to bed and I can't help but feel like she is aware of that. I can't help but feel like I need to break these habits or risk being taken advantage of. I find myself rubbing her neck and shoulders, kissing her and practically begging her for affection an extremely regular basis.

592,32ja6v,"I'm in my senior year of college, graduating in a month, Political Science major with a concentration in international affairs. In my sophomore year (2 years ago) I started a sexual relationship with one of my professors who taught a comparative politics class of mine. Let's call him Andrew. He waited an entire year to ask me out, and it all was fine/not predatory. There's a significant age difference, but I don't know, I guess it never bothered me. I didn't have a problem with him being attracted to younger girls. I'm sure some people will feel differently than me, but that's to be expected. 

We don't have the most typical relationship, as to be expected as well. Since he is a professor in my major, we have worked it out so I never will have a class with him/need to ask him for any sort of professional favor within the department. All of my research has been directed by another professor. Only a few close friends + our families know about our relationship, anyway. We rarely even speak while at school. We both have our own social circles that don't intersect, and I prefer it that way, honestly. I like to be more independent in relationships in general, and past relationships have failed after spending too much time with each other/interjecting into each other's friend groups too much. I have gone out to drinks with him and a couple of his close friends before, but it is not a frequent thing. We have our own hobbies: he likes to play D&amp;D and video games, while I prefer craftier activities such as knitting or painting. We both like the same types of music and often go out to small shows together. We have a very healthy sex life. Honestly, my entire life, I had such a fetish for teacher/student relationships...clearly. I was ecstatic when it happened, and the thrill of the age difference/power play still excites me. What I appreciate the most is that the power play doesn't spill over into our personal life, outside of the bedroom. He is very respectful of me and encourages me to always be my own person. He has no interest in acting like my father or something. I appreciate that a lot haha. I always thought we had this type of dynamic that suited each other. I thought that even though he was older, he didn't see him at that point of his life that a lot of 30-year-olds have settled into. 

However, a recent series of unfortunate events (at least, in my opinion) has caused some friction/made it all-too-obvious that we are in two different stages of life. I recently experienced a terrible MRSA infection from the gym that put me in the hospital for weeks with IV Antibiotics after my immune system was having trouble fighting off the infection. After I was well again, I was still on some low-dosed antibiotics, but they were upsetting my stomach greatly. I was experiencing diarrhea almost 4 times a day. Because of this, my oral contraceptive failed. We resumed our normal sex life using a condom instead while I finished up my round of antibiotics. However, one night, he failed to pull out quick enough after he came, allowing his dick to get softer inside of me while the condom was still on. Because of this, the condom slipped off, and some ejaculate spilled out of it as I was trying to retrieve it. We rushed to the drugstore to get Plan B, but it wasn't effective..:( I guess with anything, there's a failure rate. I was just unlucky to experience it. 

I found out I was pregnant three weeks ago, and these three weeks have been hell. Andrew was with me in the doctor's office when I got an official pregnancy blood test. After it was confirmed, he started acting much different. We talked and we talked, over and over about our options. I am entirely set on getting an abortion. I need to be selfish. I'm heading to law school in the fall. I can't be in the late stages of pregnancy during my first midterm season there! He says to think about it. He says, I've always wanted to be a dad. This is the first I'm hearing of that! I think he's completely lost in the fantasy of having a family and is disregarding my feelings/my goals. Just because he has his career stability now doesn't mean that I do at all.

 I've tried to talk to him about this, but he keeps assuring me that I don't have to give up my life for the child if it's born. He says that he's already saving money and can support us. I'm afraid that in the next week, he's going to be down on one knee asking me to marry him. This is just moving too fast and I don't know how to tell the man that I love that I'm not ready to have a child for another 15-20 years! I know a lot of people are going to tell me to just dump him and have an abortion. It would be so easy, I know. The law school I will be attending is in the same city, but I won't ever have to see him again after I graduate. But...I love him, and it's half his child too. I know it's my body, and I have autonomy over my own body, but I can't help but think if the situation were reversed, I'd feel incredibly upset and betrayed.  I feel so overwhelmed. I want to just have the abortion and run away from this situation at hand, but I'm still so in love with Andrew, and I want it to work. This pregnancy is a fucking curse.

Lately we've been having a lot of arguments on absolutely stupid and trivial things that end up blowing up into huge arguments that simply go in circles and normally end with us apologizing and saying how stupid that was. Now I am not sure whether this is normal for long distance relationships (my first), but lately I feel it is connected to me being upset that she is still in touch with the first guy she ever fell in love with.

So background of her love interest: it was several years ago (when she was 16 until she was 20). They were very close but he never wanted anything official or romantic: they never kissed, hooked up or anything. However, she loved him and had wanted to be with him. They cut off contact when she was 19 and she said how it depressed her, but that she was happy to have gotten away from what was keeping her back and down.

Basically, he was described to me as a jerk who mistreated her (he would tell her not to talk to other guys and was generally controlling and would lead her on).

When we met, she said she no longer spoke to him. Shortly after, we had each others social media passwords and I noticed a message from him, but the rest of the message history was gone. I stayed quiet until one day she was stressed with university work and messaged him. I accidentally had been logged in and saw it. It hurt that she was relying on him for help. I confronted her at the time about how she deletes messages and how she messaged him when she could've asked me for help. She said she's the only person in that field of study she knows, that she was sorry she hadn't told me and that all the messages were very brother-sister like. She stopped deleting the messages and I could see they were just completely platonic.

The thing is, she would always tell me he was a jerk, an asshole and treated her badly, yet she still stayed in touch with him. Anyways, I was complaining two days ago about how she stopped texting me during her day, to which she responded she was busy, very exhausted, stressed and had little time. 

She apologized profusely and said she'd try better. We kept talking and somehow it came back to the guy she used to love. She said he messaged her asking for advice on a woman and other general messaging. Now these messages were not on social media, but on IMessage so I never saw them. I asked her how long they'd been texting (as she told me she didn't even have his number) she said two weeks. I then asked whether she messaged him that day I was pissed off that she didn't text me at all, and after a little nudging she said yes. I was upset, she apologized.

We argued later on something stupid but I feel that all these arguments are because I am feeling a little insecure (or maybe a lot) that she is talking to this guy, who she keeps saying means nothing to her.

Am I being unfair or unreasonable? I don't know if it's fair to bring up her relationship with him again, given she keeps denying she feels anything for him (she said she got over him 1-2 years ago).

1138,34qy1l,"A year and a half ago, I met this girl who we'll call Libby. At the time, she was best friends with my best friend's girlfriend, and we've always gotten along really well. She's really pretty, but I honestly never had any sort of feelings for her; I just thought she was cute.


Ever since I turned 21, me and Libby have been bar buddies. I would go out with her every Thursday night for the bar specials and I would end up going to her place and crashing on the couch. After going out a lot and getting to know her more, she opened up to me one drunken night about two months ago and told me her life story. I sat and cried with her that night and ended up going to bed at about 4am. That morning we got up at about 10:00 and just talked until about 12:00, and that was when I realized that I started to like her more than a friend.


Recently I haven't been able to do go to the bars with her because of work in the morning (I have to drive for my job, so no going into work hungover), and a couple weeks ago Libby sent me a text that said I miss my favorite bar buddy :(. This killed me on the inside. I know she doesn't like me because she always solidifies to everyone that we're **just really good friends** and she dances with a lot of guys at the bars, has FWB's, was in a relationship from January to March, etc. I've never danced with her because I've always felt too awkward to ask.


She's more comfortable texting me now and we're like bros, but it hurts anymore when I go out with her and she talks about the guy's number she got or the guy that she danced with, or the hot guy over there. She's set me up with a few girls at the bars, and we kind of wingman each other. Recently though its been hurting so much that I have to leave the bars early so I don't have to see her dance with somebody or go home with somebody, call her FWB, etc. I've been crashing at my best friends place recently so I don't have to sleep at her place on the couch.


I've thought about just telling her how I feel even though she doesn't feel the same way, but I feel like that would ruin our friendship. That I would come across as weird or something.

He also talks to her on skype and I've seen him texting her a few times before, but every time I glance at their conversations he'll quickly close out the text or change the tab so I don't see what they are saying.

 First you should know he lives with me 4-5 days a week. 3 weeks ago he got a stomach flu and spent the weekend at my place doing nothing (not really talking or being affectionate or anything else - he was sick I get it) it took him over a week to get better, but we never started having sex or being affectionate again. 



About a week ago I calmly asked him about it and he said he was just feeling like he was borderline depressed, like a shell of his normal self.

 I told him I would be there for him but that it was really hurting me to feel so alone in our relationship. After that talk he began to be affectionate again. Now he's back to playing video games, joking around, playing rough with the dog etc but still - no sex.

389,24kz6a,"I was dumped at the beginning of this February. She said that she did not love me anymore and that she did not see a future with me. The first month was really bad; lost weight, cried, begged, etc. 


Then at the beginning of March I was terminated from my engineering position. Losing my job didn't hurt, it was the rejection I felt; I just kept wondering what is wrong with me?  


The first Sunday after losing my job I called my ex after not talking with her for a couple of weeks. I felt that maybe she'd had enough time to think over things. I started the conversation just fine, but a few minutes later I was basically back to pleading with her to reconsider and give me another chance. She simply said no, and that she was over me and that I needed to move on. After she hung up I just felt numb... Like, is this how it ends? 


In January we were making love and talking about a future where I would let her have chickens and turtles in the house if she wanted. And the dogs could sleep on the bed, and how cute our mixed babies would be (I'm Mexican, she is Vietnamese). Like how did that change so fast? 


That same Sunday I posted an ad on Craiglist basically saying it was my first time, and that I was curious about giving oral to another man. 
There was a response within 30 min from someone that lived 10 min away and we met up. I ended up giving him head on two occasions. After that I started posting more. To date I have met up with 6 men, and have given or received oral sex multiple times with each one. 


Usually I would hook up for a week or two, then call her and see how she was, and if she felt different about us, then hook up some more when she rejected me. 


When she dumped me she gave me other reasons besides simply not being in love with me anymore. She didn't like that I had few friends and didn't make time to go out with the boys. She thought that I was not romantic like I used to be. She said that I had let myself go, and that my muscles were not big like they were. She said her friends did not like me, and that I was socially awkward. The worst is that she confessed she felt this way for over a year but was trying to work through it. 


Should I be mad about that or happy she at least tried? 


She did not communicate all this to me very well by the way. I did not know that she was thinking of leaving me over these things. I worked full time as an engineer in a really stressful position. I made time to cook meals for myself and her during the week, and I made sure she had gas money when she was struggling. I didn't make it a priority to keep in touch with friends like I should have. I did not get fat, but I did lose my muscles. 


I did plan dates for us but I guess they were not up to her standards. I have taken her to see and experience cool shit over the years (art, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, aquariums, beaches). All that is on top of the standard stuff that comes with me. I made meals for her, I showered her with verbal and physical affection. She never had to worry about me doing anything behind her back or about drama. My immediate and extended family treated her really well, because they know me and know they better have! 


Sex life was good, but she mentioned that it was sometimes one sided in my favor. And she is 100% right (she gave me a lot of head). But the overall relationship was one-sided in HER favor by a lot. 


She met my immediate family 5 months into our relationship. Then met my extended family 3 months later. She got to have a relationship with my sisters, cousins, my mom and dad. They treated her very well.


In almost five years I had ZERO meaningful conversations with her sisters. I didn't even meet her family until we had been dating for 2 years. They didn't treat me well, and we never got close. I offended her brother once and he never spoke to me after that. I constantly felt like I had to 'earn' their respect. 


To be honest it is good that she left me because she was not a good girlfriend, and I did not feel fulfilled. I think I wanted to orgasm a lot because I was not fulfilled in other areas. So I asked for head a lot. I feel really shitty about that. I don't want to repeat that pleasure-seeking pattern. 


For the last several months many people have come forward to tell me that I could do so much better than her, and that they never said anything because I was in love and it was not their place. Family &amp; friends have all told me it is a great thing she left me. 


People tell me I am extremely good looking and that I am a catch. 


Not saying that to brag, but to say that 'I' don't feel that way. I feel ugly, and that I have nothing to attract a woman. I feel boring and not at all sexy. 


Two weeks ago I checked out a motel room and hooked up with a guy for over 4 hrs. We made out, gave each other oral, and ended up cuddling. The whole encounter was really intimate, and we spent a lot of time touching and cuddling.


At the same time I have made all those changes she wanted. I have a great group of friends going again. I am really fit again, and have my muscles back. I plan things and follow through. She still does not want me back.


Today I decided I didn't want to keep hooking up. I met up with some 19 yr old at his place. We cuddled and that was so nice. 


Like that is what I miss, that is the hole I am trying to fill. The intimacy with the person you love. That is way more than sex, way more than cumming. We cuddled, then he blew me and I came. I still feel so empty. This is not working, it is making things worse. 


I don't want to hook up with strangers anymore, but I don't know what to do now. If I improve and become a great person and meet someone new and fall in love again... How the hell would I explain what has been going on for the last three months if it ever came to light? 


People tell me that she did not deserve me, but look at what I am.

It's now just me, him, and my girlfriend (who he is good friends with also) are in our apartment when he starts to grind on my girlfriend. My gf doesn't really dance so she wasn't really into it, just laughing it off. I was laughing too, he dances like this with a lot of girls. After like half a minute of dancing, it was already getting awkward because of how suggestive his dancing was. Then he starts to kiss her neck. What the fuck?? I kind of just froze. I'm not a confrontational person and am generally passive and reserved. Here is my best friend kissing my girlfriend's neck while I am like three feet from them. She is passive and reserved too so she didn't react much. He's made out with so many of our friends when he dances with them so it wasn't out of character. Trying to diffuse the situation I was like okay youre too drunk, we're going to bed party is over. Then he says I have something to tell. 


I was still shock and kind of disregarded it. My girlfriend and I went to room where we just laid on the bed and said how awkward that situation was.

How can he say he's me best friend but do that to me? He does that to all the girls he dances with but she was my fucking girlfriend. And to do it when I was standing in front of them? I don't really care if he's gay, my gf and I thought he was attracted to women at the time. I know hes apologized but it was because I brought it up, not him. Like the next morning he wouldn't have even remembered to apologize for it. Another thing, my gf was uncomfortable but she didn't seem too upset by the entire deal and never brought it up with him. I told her he apologized to me and her but she never went to him herself. My best friend kissed her neck and she doesnt confront him?

1072,3220jl,"Every day I am looking out for the next piece of manipulation, the next play for attention, the next thing that will add some poison into my life, everything to bring her attention, approval and everything to make me feel like I'm constantly serving her emotionally for very little reward.

We live together with my daughter (6f) from a previous relationship and our baby daughter (11 months).  

She's totally self-centred.  I can't really sum up how totally self-centred she is.

For example, if I tell her about something cool our baby has done, she will instantly take credit and seek approval....Yes, she did that because I have been teaching her to do that.  Even if she didn't do it she will lie and say she has.  It's almost like if someone gets approval for something she can't sit there and enjoy their accomplishment, it has to become her own.

It's actually so deeply entrenched in her.  For example, she was tidying with my daughter and I went in and gave my daughter a big load of praise for doing such a good job.  My gf without any empathy clarified that it was mostly her that did the tidying, almost implying that my daughter was being dishonest in accepting any praise.  I was left sadenned that a potentially fabulous moment that could have encouraged my daughter to embrace the need for tidyness suddenly became about my gf and her amazing tidying skills.

If I say something like wow, our baby just did something I've not seen before....my gf will say yeah, she did that with me last week......ahh ok...

She consumes all our conversation time with self-gratifying verbal diarrhea.  If I talk about something she will quickly change the subject or relate it back to herself.  I'm finding more and more that our conversations are so predictable.  I'll say something, she'll turn it back to her and talk for ages, vacuously.  I know that most is exageration, fabrication, just stuff to make herself look amazing.

She's a walking talking self-obsessed manipulator.

She wasn't always like this.  She has her good days, she has her bad.  Last night she went pretty crazy.  Drunk quite a lot and was talking endlessly.  I was just listening to nonsense hoping she would stop.

I've looked at what I think she could have.  She seems to possess a lot of the traits of someone with NPD.  She lacks empathy really, because she is so self-serving.

We went to an aquarium for my daughter's 5th birthday.  A heart melting moment was when my daughter noticed a charity display talking about how many sharks were killed each year.  She burst into tears because she didn't want the sharks to die.  I went to her to support her.  On her own birthday she was forgetting the fun she was having and instead thinking about the poor sharks.  I had a lump in my throat and I said we would give some money to help the sharks and they would be saved....my gf stood absolutely stone dead 5 ft away.  She couldn't have been more unmoved.  She didn't even say a word of support.

I was really sad that she didn't feel any kind of empathy for my daughter.  A young child so at the mercy of very confusing emotions, and I imagined my gf thinking more about the inconvenience to her, how she was looking at us with a deliberately impatient face to make us feel guilty for stopping and again serving her emotionally.

It does make me so angry.  If she just lost all this bullshit we could be so happy.

How can I approach this with her?  She is so hyper-defensive about anything.  Can never admit weakness or fault.  If I've ever criticised her in the past she will get defensive, not say she's done anything wrong, cry, make me feel guilty for upsetting her, then the next day she will be on her best behaviour to get in my good books for a while.

It came out over time that not only was he very married, but he had very young children with his wife. Carol continued to see Roy, and this put a strain on her and my relationship. I never liked Roy, though I've only been around him a handful of times. He was very possessive over Carol and he looked unstable, something in his eyes scared me. 

I immediately told Carol my concerns and she seemed to believe he was possessive and controlling because he loved her so much -- she was almost flattered by it. I explained this was not normal or healthy. She didn't seem bothered, this is where I started seriously worrying.

They became business partners and started spending all day together. Roy continually lied to Carol, saying he'd soon leave his wife though he never had the intention to based on messages Carol found he'd send his wife.

Before I begin with the details, I want you to know I've tried hard to help Carol. I've pleaded with her to file police reports, she'd respond by disappearing on me for months. I begged her to tell her parents, I gave her resources for help. I've spoken with domestic violence hotlines, found a women's support group, made appointments with therapists for her, she'd never go and she'd never call. 

She loves him and I think she believes him when he says he loves her too. I've given her websites and pamphlets about abusive relationships and how to know if you're in one/where to get help. She has admit she realizes that she is in one, and she sits with me while I make her appointments with therapists, but she never goes because they make up and she says they're good now.

One day Carol showed up at my doorstep trembling, she told me Roy hit her hard in the face. I pleaded with her to file a police report, she was so shaken and upset she refused. I told her to report it to their boss since it happened in the work place. I stayed with her while she called and the boss said something along the lines of I'm glad you told me, let's talk about this tomorrow, come to my office. 

The next day, Carol called me after the meeting. The boss basically pulled them both in a room and told them to figure out if they'll continue working together or not.

[I was so shocked and appalled by this reaction -- I thought he'd lose his job, I was sure of it! Can't the boss be sued for negligence?! I was furious that nothing came of this.]

The hitting continued, once every few months, though I'm sure she isn't telling me everything. Carol would pull away from me for months at a time when things were good with her and Roy, then come back around weak and thinner than the last time I'd seen her. She has been isolated by all of her friends, mutual friends say they won't support her carrying on an affair but they don't know about the domestic violence.

Roy monitors her phone, emails, Facebook, etc. He insults and degrades her, she feels worthless without him, she's dependent on him, it goes on. Again, they spend every single day together because they work as a team in real estate. Their pictures are everywhere. She is dependent on him financially since he does most of the work and gives her a cut of the money given she stay with him the entire time.

Here are a few things she has told me:

-She called me over a year ago to tell me she was pregnant, she stopped taking her birth control and didn't tell Roy. I'm 100% sure she purposely got pregnant thinking he'd leave his family for her. He told her to get an abortion, which she did, but I think she wanted to keep the baby.

-She's unexperienced with dating and was genuinely surprised when I told her I didn't have anal sex with my boyfriend. She said Roy made her, he told her everyone does it and no one would ever be with her if she didn't. She'd let him frequently, and she'd cry the entire time because of the pain. He wouldn't stop. It sounded like rape to me, this disturbed me.

-Another story she told is one where he put a pill in her mouth and forced her to swallow it, it was ecstasy. She'd never done drugs before. This obviously also disturbed me.

-I noticed after a few months of them dating she would answer questions people asked her with We which really bothered me. ie: Oh you're in real estate? How do you like it? We love it, we have so many houses in escrow! And the person would sit there a little confused like, Who is we? I was asking you... It's like her identity has become their coupling. It was weird...

I beg her to leave him, I tell her I'll stay with her every step of the way, he monitors our conversations and for some time wouldn't leave us alone together. He scares me so I backed off and told Carol I'd always be there if she needed anything.

Fast forward 4 months later, last weekend she shows up at my doorstep shaking and thinner than ever. She starts bawling about how he's been seeing another woman (besides the wife.) And I sit with her and listen, as the domestic violence hotline told me to do. 

She finally tells me that months ago, he strangled her. She said he had her pinned on the ground and choked her for a long time, she looked in his eyes and feared for her life. He threatened he'd call his friends on her if she ever said anything. She was crying, but seemed to be more upset about the fact he was cheating on her. [Even though he is also cheating with her...also he has been caught lying and cheating with multiple people several times, she stays with him in the end.]

I can't sit silently anymore, I've already had a few anxiety attacks over the last few years worrying about her -- I know he is unstable and capable of something terrible, I've seen it in his eyes. 

Two years ago I finally told her parents that Roy is married with a wife and children, I left out the abuse because I felt like I'd betray Carol's trust. I did repeat some of the things he has said to her, about being worthless etc. I thought the verbal abuse would be enough for them to intervene but they did nothing but express their disappointment in her being a mistress.

Roy sometimes convinces Carol I am jealous of their love and relationship and I'm an instigator and trouble maker. I think Carol knows deep down inside that isn't true, but he does have her brainwashed [and his wife, who according to a message Carol snooped on, he also physically abuses.]

I am scared for her safety, and she tells me she's scared every time her phone goes off because he grabs it before she can.

Roy is a very manipulative and deceitful person, he hangs around a shady and scary group of people. He has threatened Carol that if she ever went to the authorities, he'd call his friends on her. Now that threat extends to me.

I won't be intimidated and threatened in to silence. I'm prepared to out him to the police and his family. The only reason I haven't is because I know in my heart that Carol would defend him, deny the crimes he has commit and then I would be Roy's target. He's made comments before about how he just wants to kill someone tonight. I am seriously afraid of him, I don't know what he's capable of. Thanks to Carol he knows where I work and live.

I don't know what to do, I wish she had filed police reports so there was a trail. I'm not sure how to help her get out of this, she is so far deep. She is with him most of the day, every single day. They make a successful team so she fears for her career as well. Mostly I think there is a part of her that thinks he will leave his wife and stop the abuse. I just am at a loss. I can't stop worrying about her and my anxiety hasn't gone unnoticed, it is affecting my job and relationships. 

If anything ever happened to her I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

We still talk as friends, but she doesn't always reply when we message each other. She does, however, say she isn't gonna date anyone (m or f) for quite along time.

300,1rfs3w,"To start, I'll say I was advised against this relationship from the start. Everyone who knows this girl knew she had a habbit of going through boyfriends, and also knew that I would probably be no exception. She did a great job luring me in for her needs and dumping me once she got bored. She made everything seem so genuine, and really made me feel loved with all the attention she provided. We spent every day together for almost 2 months until one weekend she was acting distant, completely out of character (I'd known her for two years prior to our relationship). I asked what was wrong and she said nothing. The next day she said she wanted to try spending time away from me because she thought it would be good for us. After a week of going to bars (that we usually went to) with other guy friends, she messaged me over text that she wanted to break up and her mind was completely made up. I had a feeling this might happen but I kept telling myself that I was just being paranoid because no one could go from being so lovey to so distant and emotionless so quickly. I was wrong and the break up had me in shock.   
  
  
We talked things out and I discovered her decision was absolute, and stemmed from the paranoia I expressed while she was going out with her guy friends. I was paranoid because she told me early on that she cheated on multiple past boyfriends like it was no big deal, and this has always been a huge fear of mine. She was also into the BDSM community and let a previous engagement come to an end because her (then) fiance was uncomfortable with her having dom/sub relationships with other men while they were together (he did try, the poor soul).  
  
  
One of her main points for the break up was that she didn't allow enough time to herself between relationships, and that she really needed time for herself, her child and family and no one else. I know that it's none of my business what she does, but like a usual love sick ex I found myself snooping her various social profiles. Against my better judgment I found her fetlife profile (for those of you who aren't familiar, think myspace for fetishes) and discovered that a week to the day of us ending things she posted pictures of her bare, battered, marked ass with the caption: new playmate! I love it when he spanks me, off to a new adventure!  
**I was, and still am devistated.**  
  
  
Looking back and being honest with myself, she was and still is a textbook definition of a slut (as much as I might have wanted [and still want] to convince myself otherwise). She used me for her own needs and threw me away, and I've never been treated like this. I've been trying to distance myself from her despite our mutual desire to remain friends. I'm sure others have been in a similar situation. Can anyone offer advice?

I even specifically told him that it would help if he would finger me or try oral. This has been going on for about two-ish years, and honestly, I feel like this should be important to him. I have yet to have an orgasm from anything he has tried with me. I understand that it's not completely his responsibility to make me cum, but he sure as hell isn't getting me even halfway there.

A few weeks ago, she got a pixie cut. Normally, I could care less about my partners haircut.  This one, however, makes her look like a man. For Some women, a pixie cut is hot as hell. For other women, it's like a one way ticket to suburban divorcee aunt in her fifties. I feel like it's one of those cuts with no middle ground.  She had a pixie cut in college and it looked hot.

The problem, last year when we were pretty close I drove him to his dads city for a free tattoo. His dad owns a shop and is an award winning artist.

Roy on the other hand is always telling me to show it to people, he's so proud of his dads work. His dad used to own a shop in our town, even the artists there can't believe this work came out of that man and completely understand why I want it covered.

I have mentioned to him that I would like to hear his voice every now and then, so I may receive a random right before his bedtime phone call once a week.

This is all in one night after work.  C'mon!  It's like he is trying to avoid me asking for us to meet up.

I am beginning to think I am an option, especially since the dating website we met on he has still been updating it (new picture and profile text).  I sign on to my profile simply because I know he looks at it.  I am so worried about running this man away that I'm ready to give him up.  I have not asked him to lock in this deal because I feel the man should ask for exclusiveness.  When the woman does it men tend to flake away.  As I mentioned earlier, I like him and happy to have his company.  It's just that sometimes I feel I'm picking Friday and Susie gets Saturday.  A big eye-opener that I may be just a random option is, I received my degree this weekend and I heard nothing from him.  No congrats or anything.

I brought it up a week after knowing, and she broke up with said boyfriend. Fast forward a month, and we started actually dating.

Things were good, actually, they were amazing. I felt I could trust her, she told me everything I wanted to know (even things I didn't want to hear but for the sake of anxiety) and that she was genuinely glad that I made her life better. She was also the first one in this relationship to say she loved me. I actually believed she was changed, and I didn't have to worry.

Now, 6 months later I still thought things were great (albeit anxiety from a guy who kept hitting on her at her workplace who knew she was in a relationship) and communication was strong. She came over last weekend and told me that things were not working out and that she didn't love me anymore.

I didn't get it. I decided to stay and move here (college), we had plans to do things in the future, she was still acting the same as she usually did... until that. It was sudden and it was harsh. I gave gave and gave, without caring what I got back, but it apparently wasn't enough.

The night of the get together and my friend texts me saying its just going to be a guys night which happens occasionally so that was whatever. I told her what happened and that we could still hang out the next night if she wanted. She was cool with it and so we did.

I decided taking her out to frozen yogurt would be a good idea so that's where we went. I know it might sound lame but this was my first real date so to say the least, I was nervous. I was thinking of what I was going to say to her and how to keep a conversation going. When I arrived at her house she started the conversation and it was WAY easier to keep going than I originally thought. She brought up how she wanted to keep hanging out and wanted to get to know me better. She also said that she didn't know why we had never hung out before.

Fast forward to the next weekend and the same thing happens with another get together so this time we decide to go to the movies to see Interstellar. (Great movie by the way, would definitely recommend it.) After the movie I dropped her off at her friends house and we made out in her driveway, she came onto me and at this point I had no clue of how she felt towards me.

She came over my house during the week the next week to watch breaking bad because she told me how she had never seen it and I wanted to re-watch it anyways. So we did that and it went nicely.

The next weekend was her birthday. I had remembered how she mentioned liking someone else's Pandora ring and then she also tweeted about liking them so I took the hint and bought her one. I also took her out on the town for dinner and gave her the ring there. We kissed a few times throughout the night and had an awesome time together. She kept saying how extravagant the ring was and that no one had ever done something like this for her. I finally felt like I was making someone else happy.

The next week after school I asked her how she really felt about me and I told her about how I felt towards her. She said that she really liked me but didn't think we should be official because of how close we were to graduation and that it would be hard to breakup because our colleges are so far away from each other. I understood her point of view and was ok with it. As long as we were both happy for the time, then I was fine with it. I told myself if there was one thing I was getting from this, then it was experience for next time.

During the same week, she came over on Thursday to watch breaking bad. We watched one episode and then she asked to go up to my room since no one was home. I happily obliged and we proceeded upstairs. We sit on my bed and talk for a little bit. She comes onto me and starts making out with me and unbuttons her flannel, I start feeling her up and have the most amazing moments of my life so far. We hear my dog start barking which usually means someone was home so to play it safe we get our stuff together and just sit down and talk.

We started talking about how how my friend had committed suicide 2 years ago which I am able to talk about to anyone now and it isn't too much of a problem. I was a little sad after we talked about but I hadn't been crying or anything. (Not trying to sound manly at all, just telling the truth.) She said she was sorry for bringing it up and we kissed and made it all better I guess.

Later that night we went to a presentation at our school about an NBA player who was a drug addict and had recovered. When we were leaving she just kind of left and didn't say much. I tried not to think to much of it.

The next week at school is where it goes downhill...

She kind of avoids me in school and at the end of the day I get called down to the guidance office. I'm told that someone close to me is concerned for my well-being. I tried to guess who said something and she was the third person I guessed. She had said that some things I was retweeting on twitter and some of the things I said were warning signs. So we had this whole conversation and it turns out I'm not suicidal. What a surprise!

The girl I have been talking to then texts me after school and says that she doesn't think that we are on the same page and doesn't want to continue a relationship. She also says that she went to guidance to talk about herself and since I was becoming a bigger part of her life, I came up. She said that she begged them not to call me down until she talked to me. She said she isn't in a position to be in a relationship and doesn't want to lead me on anymore. She says she wants to give the ring back because it's too much. I refuse.

The next day my sister goes to her house because she is friends with her younger sister and her mom gives her some money to give to me for the ring. I take it and leave it in their mailbox with a note.

The girl I have been talking to then texts me and says that I did nothing wrong and she just doesn't want to be with anyone right now.

If I made her so happy, which I know I did because she said it all the time, then why wouldn't she want to continue that? I'm very confused and I need help understanding what happened. I'll provide additional information to anyone in the comments that needs it.

TL;DR  Started talking to a girl, she kind of lead me on and now we aren't talking anymore. Sorry for the bad TL;DR but I would rather you read the story because it will make a lot more sense.","Me [18 M] with my ex-girlfriend kind of relationship thing [18 F] 2 months, weird situation and I need help understanding.",0,False,4,17,1418687057,/r/relationships/comments/2peu0a/me_18_m_with_my_exgirlfriend_kind_of_relationship/,Romantic

Usually when I date someone, the power balance becomes almost immediately clear -- one person likes the other more. Women tend to fall for me hard, and I'm left thinking Ahh! Too much, too soon!. And once in a while I'll become totally infatuated with someone and she's just not that interested. Story of my life.

In this case, it feels like the level of attraction is still pretty balanced. It seems too good to be true. Do I keep opening up to her and talking to her every day, or do I take things slower?

Obviously the fear here is opening up too much and being rejected. It's pretty rare for me to meet someone whom I really click with.

What do y'all think?
