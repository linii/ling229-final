103418,Dating,1t292o,"I don’t know what to do with this information and I don’t understand what’s going on with me. I have little to no experience with relationships or even liking other people. I try and block those kinds of feelings/experiences out; I have a lot to deal with outside of a social/romantic life. When I found out my best friend is polygamous and she has a new girlfriend that was completely ok with me. However you love is how you love. But she didn’t know that and lied to me for a month about having a new girlfriend. Thinking that I would be mad at her, that I would be angry that the new girlfriend wasn’t me with her male fiancée.


Which is kind of true, maybe? I don’t know. I got angry and hurt at her by lying on omission. I’ve seen her through worse things that have happened in her life. While I was upset at her she lays at my feet that she ‘loves me’, and if she had it her way we would be dating. Now when I first met her, I’ll admit I was interested and liked her. Personally I’m a bisexual. When I found out she was already in a relationship I decided to back off emotionally, she didn’t know this until recently. 


Now that I know she’s polygamous, I feel…jilted I guess. I’ve never been in a polygamous relationship, but I think I could have tried with her fiancé; but not including the new girlfriend. I try and be an honest person so I tell her all of this, saying that we would still be friends but I  need some time to get over a) being hurt by her distrust and b) being, I don’t know. Disappointed that I decided not to begin a relationship. 


So, here comes my problem. I feel really childish about it but, normally I would just never want to talk to her again and run away really fast. But that’s not an option, she’s my best friend and she has some major anxiety and depressive issues happening. She got so panicky about me not talking to her again, she told me she couldn’t live without me. 
I guess I just need some advice about how to repair a friendship after all this, like I stated before. I have little to no experience with this, if you need a bit more information I would be happy to provide it. I don’t think she uses this site anyway.

138494,Non-Romantic,20km1x,"Hi reddit!
I have a bit of a sticky situation that I could use some help detangling. This is a throwaway that I’ll delete later to let someone else have the awesome username. 

Some background: I’m 25 year old lady engineer that’s about halfway done a master’s of engineering. My boyfriend of five years is also halfway done his engineering masters. We lived together for our last year of undergrad and a year between the undergrad and masters that we took off to work. We now live with our respective parents (about six months now) because grad school is cripplingly expensive. We are very happy together and incredibly well matched (values, hobbies, ideas for the future). The only thing keeping us from tying the knot is money.  I developed a nasty anxiety disorder that made me quit my job about two years ago but it is being controlled through an antidepressant, CBT and gluten free diet (don’t laugh, it worked!). My anxiety is still there, but my life isn’t being controlled by it anymore. My triggers are being without a snack, high pressure situations, and digestive issues (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation). I’m also hypoglycemic and have a minor heart condition.

My boyfriend and I do want kids in the next 5 to 10 years, however I’m not sure that I could mentally handle being pregnant. I’m afraid that the side effects like morning sickness would aggravate my anxiety disorder and that I’d be terrified of eating/drinking/photosynthesizing something that would harm the baby. I was also sexually assaulted several times in my youth and early teenage years and am uncomfortable with sharing my body. It was never anything too traumatizing, and I have never told anyone before, mainly because I don’t feel that it’s relevant to who I am today. 

I have considered adoption and am fairly convinced that it would be awesome, and my boyfriend agrees. He doesn’t mind if we adopt our kids instead of having them naturally. My family is more of an issue. I’ve been made aware that my parents really want grandchildren (not a problem with me) but I brought up my idea of adoption and my mom insists that I have one of my own first because pregnancy is “such a magical experience” and stated that she would be upset if I never got pregnant. I have also considered surrogacy but it would be harder to defend than adoption. 

My issue is that I predict that I would have to tell everyone in my family that I was assaulted to stop the invasive questions about the functioning of my reproductive system. Seriously, they don’t know when to stop. I tried to keep me failing a driving test a secret a few years ago and that ended with extended family “teasing” about my abilities for years. I didn’t retake the test for three years out of spite. I’m afraid that if I do adopt or get a surrogate that I’ll be humiliated for “copping-out” of the whole pregnancy thing and been seen as cowardly and something to discuss over tea and cookies. 

As far as I see it, I can tell everyone that:
•	either my boyfriend or I am infertile, keep my past to myself, and fend off questions for intimate details
•	Take the “there’s too many children in the world” path and let them decide that that’s not the real reason (they will)
•	tell a few select people about the assault and let them do a terrible job of fending off the questions of distant relatives, or
•	pretty much tell everyone about the assault and let them wonder why a victim wouldn’t want to be pregnant anyway. 

Not answering their questions tends to make them all even more curious, which is why telling that that it’s none of their business doesn't really work. This is my only problem with my family. I love them to bits and don’t consider cutting them off to be an acceptable option. I really, really don’t want to tell my parents about what happened years ago because it would be devastating for them and there was no way that they could have prevented it. I also don't fancy making it public knowledge. Any ideas reddit? I would really value any input or different perspectives on this. I hope I'm not being oversensitive about this whole thing.

190949,Relationships,2fj7oz,"I've suffered from depression since I was 13, but in the last two years it's gotten much worse due to several traumatic incidents. I've also developed bad anxiety and I often feel suicidal. I find it very difficult to go out and do things and I often have panic attacks. I can't be around large crowds. Having to talk to people I don't know well is incredibly exhausting. Recently I've been having more bad days than good...I'd say out of the last week, I've felt depressed/anxious at least every second day, and had serious suicidal thoughts at least three times. I am seeing a therapist to work through my own issues, but it's a very long and drawn-out process.

I've been with my boyfriend for the last six months. He knew about all my issues before we started dating and when we decided to become exclusive he asked if I thought I could handle being in a relationship, because he didn't want me to say yes and then feel pressured or stressed out. I said yes, because at that time I felt a lot stronger and more in control. Now I feel that the burden of my mental illness isn't fair on him. 

I care about him very much, in fact I know I love him (we haven't said that to each other yet though) and I think we have a good relationship. But as I get more and more depressed/anxious I'm becoming clingier, more insecure, and jealous. I've come to see him as a crutch to lean on, which isn't fair. I'm basically only happy when I'm with him. He's been incredibly supportive and I know he cares about me and wants to look after me. But ultimately I feel incredibly guilty that I'm leaning on him so much. I feel like eventually he's going to get tired of all my shit and will want to leave me, but he's a good guy and probably wouldn't want to do that to someone he knows very well is suicidal. So my question is: should I let him off the hook and break up with him now? I don't want him to feel obligated to stay with me as I slip further and further into the darkness. I feel it might be kinder just to break things off now.

50531,Breakups,24o0ib,"We started dating in high school. We went to the same college, more through our own choice than for the other, but I don't really expect to convince anyone of that. I have never been in a LTR before, and I don't really know how to handle this. I always read that guys are okay right after the breakup, then meltdown in the future, where girls are the opposite. I don't want to do that. I want to know that I made the right decision and move on. 

Since I have never been with anyone, it wasn't fair for me to stay with this girl when I was always wondering what else there is. It wasn't so much that the grass is always greener, I literally had nothing to compare us to. She also was not the greatest person. I am very sure that this is what is best for us both.

So here is my issue. I don't want to let this affect me in a negative way for any longer than it has to. I want to be at peace with this and move on. I think I still love this girl, but we can't work as a relationship. So I want to handle my emotions properly, grow, and be over it. I have no idea how to do that. I've never had to do this before. I don't want to be sulking everytime I see her on facebook. I don't want to have the urge to call her when I'm drunk. I don't want to check my phone for texts form her that I know aren't there. I don't want to be reminded of her by every little thing. I'd like to not be thinking about her in as short of a time as possible. But I just don't know how.

160784,Relationships,2nt9q6,"I'm going to sound like the biggest brat in the world when I talk about this. I consider myself not to be a selfish person, or hung up on material things. For Christmas, from anyone, I usually just ask for books, scarves, handmade anything, etc. I didn't get a lot of gifts as a kid (poor, abusive family) and so I keep and cherish everything given to me, right down to gifted beer bottle caps, or trinkets. 

I love to give gifts, too, of course. This year I've gotten my boyfriend some art, I'm making him a scarf and hat set based on one he liked on another guy, and I signed him up for 6 months of a wine of the month club because we both love wine and drink it together. I thought it'd be nice, and I got a super good discount on it all so it was not very expensive. Plus, he loves getting gifts and we agreed Christmas is the one time it's nice to get them.

I told him the general amount I spent and told him that I didn't mind if he spent less, more, whatever. He said that he would think about it. From what I know, he's financially stable. We don't eat out ever or get drinks, we live together, and he doesn't exactly throw money around. Our relationship is on the marriage track, I'd say. We've both talked and he's as into it as me.

So then earlier in the week, he pulls me aside and tells me that he's sorry, but he can't afford to get me anything for Christmas this year. He said he was tapped out, didn't have money for anything for anyone. Of course I wasn't upset or anything, I was happy he told me now so I wasn't disappointed then. We went on to have a nice night.

A few days later, something happened. We were out together at Walmart getting some supplies, and he pops up with a video game (Smash Brothers? I don't know. I don't play game like, ever). I ask him if he's asking Santa for it for Christmas in a teasing way, and he says, plainly, ""No, I'm getting it tonight."" 

I'm a little confused then. I don't say anything (it's his money, after all), but we get home and he's setting it up to play with his friends who are coming over later. They come over and they're all talking about some other game that's coming out soon, and he says ""Oh yeah, I'm buying that one the day it comes out."" They were talking about some other stuff  before I went to the bedroom to do my thing and I overheard him talking about his paid game subscriptions and a third game he was planning on getting soon. 

So I am a little confused and sort of upset. He's not buying anything with gift cards, he's not pre-ordered any of them.

I'm posting because I want to know if there's something I'm missing, or if this is acceptable and I'm just being selfish/greedy? It seems to me that if he can spend $100 in a month on video games, he could at least buy me a pair of nice socks or something? Hell, buy me a bottle of nail polish. Just show me that I'm at least as important as the games he's playing? Should I be concerned? Is this a red flag?

7356,Breakups,29kzc6,"I have been seeing this guy I met through mutual friends for three months. He was originally a one night stand who asked for my number and then proceeded to text me for 2 weeks straight before I agreed to see him again.

We had a ton of stuff in common, enjoyed hanging out with each other and our friends, and he got along really well with my dog whom he affectionately/jokingly called his boyfriend. He even walked my dog for me at 2 am once during a sleepover so I wouldn't need to wake up to do it. We texted each other every day and saw each other once a week. He was incredibly affectionate- holding my hand in public, kissing me, putting his arm around me, cuddling, etc. 

He told me that he needed to take things slow and did not want to jump into a relationship as he has dated crazy girls before and also did not want to have to deal with a ton of new expectations. I told him that I was looking for a relationship but we could see where it goes. We had this conversation at around 1 month into seeing each other.

Two months into seeing each other, he invited me and my dog to stay with him for a weekend. I went and we had a lot  of fun. However, at dinner with his friends one night he began talking about his okcupid account and how his messages get a 70% reply rate and how happy he was that he was single. Right in front of me. I broke up with him the next day telling him that while I enjoyed his company, I wanted to put the breaks on sexually as it was obvious we were looking for different things, I was growing attached,  and I did not want to be his fuck buddy. He asked to talk in person the next day and told me that while he was not ready to be exclusive he too was growing attached and cared about me, that the conversation had taken him by surprise and he was not seeing anyone else seriously- a few first dates that went no where. He reiterated that he felt we were just getting to know each other and did not want to rush things or lie about what he was doing. I agreed to keep seeing him.

We had a great month but then last weekend happened. He was going to come to see me on Saturday but said he was having a bad day and I had plans to see him at a BBQ he invited me to the next day anyway. I and my dog went to the party the next day at his friend's house and upon seeing me, he gave me a quick hug and then moved away to talk to his friends. Very different from the PDA he usually showed. At one point he told friends that my dog was his boyfriend, however he still was bot interacting with me at all. Near the end of the BBQ, I left the table I was eating at to go inside and get another drink. He came up behind me, grabbed my ass, and told me he was heading to the table to kiss me in front of his friends, but I had moved. Some other people came into the house and he took a step back from me and started chatting with them. I excused myself to check on my dog. Right before I was leaving, we are again in the same vicinity when a friend of his brings up his wedding in 16 months. The guy I'm seeing starts saying that he is an eternal bachelor and will still be single at this friends party. At this point one of his friends whom I dont know asked me how I ended up at the party. Too embarrassed to say I was seeing the guy who just announced how happy he is to be single, I tell him that I'm friends with the host through college- not a complete lie. I shortly after leave the party and decide to text the guy I am seeing that it was becoming increasingly clear that he wasn't ready for a relationship and I just wanted to be friends. He tells me that I am overreating to a joke but also pushing things too fast ao he agrees that we should end it because I am being way too dramatic for him. The next day i text him and ask him if he would like to talk in person, he tells me he doesn't, he had truly enjoyed hanging out with me but that he considers the relationship over due to my being dramatic and overreacting twice. He does not think it is smart to try to be friends.

As someone who has been engaged to someone emotionally abusive and ended things about a year ago, I am just getting back into dating. He is the first guy I felt I really clicked with sexually and platonically in a long time. Did I overreact and ruin things or was I right to call things off? Did I push things too hard and too fast or was he walking all over my emotions? I do miss talking to him, should I reach out in a few weeks to see if friendship is viable or just wrote him off?

24389,Breakups,2qrbkq,"Background: Met her through her mom and step dad whom I work with but knew her mom a year before I met her as she lived with her dad (divorced) at the time a few hours away. When she moved to her moms she came to visit us at work and about a year and a half later here we are. We have been very close spending time together usually daily since we started dating. I am also close with her mom and step dad because of work. She's very attractive, funny, and we share a ot of the same interests.

Now: Mid-October I suffered a stroke the origin was suspected from my heart and I had to undergo a form of Cardiac catheterization two weeks ago. The stroke was very minor I have always been in good shape stayed active and ate pretty healthy. Yet it still took me out of work for the time being due to some vision loss. At first, everything was ok she was helpful and tried not to get frustrated. No money mo problems as for the Holiday season she wanted to constantly do all sorts of things and I did not as I had to lay low from the surgery anyways and haven't worked for two months which I think really upset her but at the same time it was hard to be in the Holiday spirit anyway. 

The arguments got worse and worse as we spent so much time together, because she didn't want to work nearly as much so that she could spend time with me. Sooner than later we were arguing almost daily over the most pointless things because the stress of everything that occurred along with just way too much time to waste together. After the cardiac surgery, I went into my recovery room and had an unexpected seizure and went unconscious. This made my mom and dad very nervous as the procedure took longer than it was supposed to as well. After that when I regained consciousness my girlfriend wouldn't even look at me she stood in the corner of the room with her arms folded and looked pissed off. She continued to have an attitude all day and night but said that someone annoyed her and that it was my mom because all my mom talked about while I was in surgery was how she was worried something went wrong. WTF?! I think that is a legitimate worry but brushed it off because I wanted to focus on recovery. Arguments continued because its just not the same anymore because of the medical issues with me. 

And now fast forward two weeks later now she drops the bomb on me that the person that annoyed her during the surgery was actually her ex because he text her that day. And that it bothered her that she still cared about what he had to say and then said she just doesn't know what she wants. Said that she had felt this way now since this happened but wanted to stick around through the surgery so that I would have someone there for me. I obviously haven't been too happy with it either but it hasn't been the top priority as recovery and getting things back to normal has been. A couple of days ago she brought up her ex and talked about how she doesn't know what to do, on top of everything else it really just made me angry more than upset so we talked and decided to take a break although this break seems like it may need to just be a break up at this point. I do love her but sometimes wonder if we're really compatible anyways and with the timing of this and how she has handled it idk if it is worth trying to continue.

So, I've been with this pretty awesome guy for 3.5 years. We both love and care for each other and we meshed really well. The relationship was full of trust and I had a lot of hope for us. And it seems all at once it went to shit. 

It started out as (what now seems like a small fight) a fight about nudes of exes I found on his computer. I wasn't snooping, I just use his computer a lot for school and random pictures I like to save. Was trying to clean them up, and happened across a folder ambiguously named, was surprised with lots of nudes of his exes. We got that issue resolved more or less, but it brought up other issues while we were talking through it. 

From that it spiraled into talks about us as a whole, and where we were going, and big picture relationship stuff. Well, I mentioned moving in together again. Something he's very apprehensive about. He's had some abusive past relationships, and the move-in stage scares him. I understand and try everything in my power to not manipulate or force him into anything. But once I mention anything about us and having a future together he shuts down and basically runs for the hills. I usually back down and give him space to think and process when this happens. 

He said that he never thinks about us having a future. That he just lives in the now. He's also very adverse to marriage. 

I asked him what that made us, if he didn't want to move in, and didn't want to get married at any point in any future. I told him that I didn't want to just be bf/gf our whole lives, going back and forth to each other's respective homes. That I needed to know the relationship could still progress and grow. 

Well that freaked him out. He broke up with me via e-mail the next day. I was really upset, felt like he was just quitting because he was scared of unknowns. Was letting his past rule his present, and we were suffering as a result. 

We talked again a few days later after a cool down. Decided to get back together, and try again. Him trying to get through his issues of commitment (therapy, more communication etc), and me trying to get a handle on my anxiety and being patient with him. 

All seemed to be back on track. But it's all felt so off every since. Before, I trusted in us, had hope for our relationship, and never thought twice about being with him. But I feel so uneasy that it's hard to have that same trust and hope. And I'm afraid that before all this I was the only one with that kind of hope and optimistic outlook on our future together. Now that I don't, or struggle to, I'm worried that if neither of us can have that hope that it's just a dying relationship.  

I don't feel butterflies really anymore, I don't feel that ""falling in love"" sensation. And I'm really worried and confused. I love him, with all my being. But I'm just scared that I'm no longer -in- love with him. That the whole breakup, no matter how brief, just really shook me. Shook me to a point of slowly falling out of love. 

I don't know if this is normal after a hard period like that. I don't know if maybe I'm just getting spooked like he did/does and that I should keep working at this. Or if maybe this is a sign to end it for good this time? 

He's my best friend. The most supportive person in my life for over 3 years. But I don't want to drag this out if it's doomed. But I just can't shake the feeling that I'm giving up on us. That I'm a horrible girlfriend because I'm faltering just as the relationship gets hard. And I really don't want to be that person.

81097,Relationships,3j45kv,"My friend (We'll call her Kat) and I were having some drinks on the beach and lamenting our failed romantic endeavors to each other - Her ex (who doesn't seem like a great guy - admittedly I only got her explanations of his actions, but he didn't sound too awesome from her point of view) and my failed romance with a girl I like (who we'll call Lisa - we were friends that had a brief time as more than friends, and it fizzled due to what I viewed as a comedy of errors). Kat and Lisa are friends.

We were musing about it all and Kat kept reiterating how awesome Lisa is, apologizing since she knows I like her, and what not. I had eventually grown tired of hearing about it and in my moment of annoyance I said 'whatever, Lisa is too white trash for me anyways' - Kat immediately smacked me and told me not to say something like that about her friend. After a few moments arguing about not hitting, I apologized for saying it - I did feel that hot feeling of regret and embarrassment. The conversation diffused and went back to normal, we finished our time on the beach and went home to bed. Kat crashed on the couch.

Next morning after I got out of the shower I brought up what I said the night before and apologized again for what I said, I felt bad for saying it and felt I was just lashing out because I was mad/sad at the situation I was in. (Seriously, shes an amazing girl and we all know that frustration of finding someone you think would compliment your life perfectly - what compounds my frustration is that it seems that circumstance and misunderstandings have been the barrier, not any glaring personality flaws - that is until now, where I'm acting like an idiot.)
Kat kind of brushes it off in that 'I get ya' kinda way.

Fast forward to later that day where I see Lisa. After some usual banter and jokes and stuff, I tell her that I needed to apologize to her for something I said the night before to Kat. Lisa is well aware that I like her, well aware that there was something (If xyz didn't happen there's a good chance we'd be in a relationship right now - Lisa) there with us, etc. She asks what - I tell her what I said. The worst thing in the world was seeing her face drop from smiling to that 'Oh wow that really hurts' - after a few moments of her not talking she tells me that it hurt because drunk speech is sober thought. This is a line I've used before so it stings to hear back as I haven't a real rebuttal. I don't think shes white trash at all - it was just a stupid comment trying to justify to myself why I shouldn't be so butthurt, ya know?

Anyway, she's not happy, I really hurt her feelings and it tears me apart to hurt someones feelings that I care about. What compounds it is that Kat thinks I brought it up out of spite, and not out of remorse. I know I didn't bring it up to hurt her feelings, it was never a thought in my mind, so I got pretty heated with Kat about that subject - won't be hearing from Kat any time soon.

Should I have just kept my mouth shut? I know that objectively keeping my mouth shut would have kept me from being in this situation right now, but it would be orders of magnitude worse IMO if Kat brought it up to Lisa on her terms. I felt guilty and needed to take it on the chin - lest I get labeled both an asshole for saying it and dishonest for not bringing it up. I'll endeavor to not say shitty things out of hurt in the future, but I should keep what I said to myself in the future I guess?

138899,Dating,2q7xb6,"About a month ago, I had a heart to heart with the woman in question, simply because the progression of our friendship hinted at the possibility of future romantic implications.  Despite the age difference, we completely understand one another and are both physically and emotionally intimate.  We are both introverts with busy work schedules, but we enjoy the times we spend together...in fact, I have it on good authority that I am almost her entire social life (as she is mine).

I asked if anything could ever develop between us, and she said that she was too old and that she wanted to see me have a family and a ""good life"".  I never tried to get a girlfriend because I know deep down that my strong will and independent personality would make it difficult to put forth the effort, so naturally, I just said, ""OK, I understand,"" and the friendship has proceeded like normal.  And by that, I mean that it still has the intimacy that has been shown in the past.

But her reasons for wanting to remain platonic seem to be the result of upbringing more than her actual feelings...although I understand that the desire to have a family is a huge motivator for some women, and I know for a fact that it bothers her that she has likely missed the chance to have one.   If I were to equate our interactions with any movie, think ""Lost in Translation""; we share our most guarded secrets and advise each other with honesty and candor.  She always tries to fight my battles, and I always try to fight hers...and we both will not have any of it...especially me.  Friends are supposed to be there for one another, but when she offers to defend me against members of my own family...that seems to cross a border.  If I did not know her stance already, I would say that we are unofficially ""going out"".

But do I re-open this can of worms?  It is so difficult to change the mind of someone who has believed something for years and is insecure about age differences...but I am finding it difficult being a friend to someone who, deep down, seems to want something more.

But then again, people form relationships for different reasons, and if she believes that ""family potential"" is more important than ""desire""...well, we really would be lost in translation, so to speak.

165088,Breakups,3hvhq3,"I play in a band and we have been touring. We also have tours booked for the future. I had been dating my girlfriend for about 9 months, and the tour recently is the first that had come up whilst we had been dating.

I'm aware that my ex-girlfriend had struggled with the idea of my being away (roughly 5 weeks) and we have tried to talk it through. Early on she mentioned the idea of an open relationship. This is not something that makes me feel extremely comfortable. I understand that open relationships can work and can work well, however, I can't bring myself to feel comfortable about my girlfriend having sex with somebody else while I am away. (Although, she claims it isn't purely about sex) This initial talk of open relationships did not end extremely well as she could not understand my aversion to the idea, however, with time it seemed to become a non-issue and she claimed that she was okay with being monogamous and being away from me for periods of time.

Recently, while away on tour, we had several arguments about our relationship not working out too well and the distance being hard to cope with, which is where she brought up the open relationship issue again. She claimed that our relationship could only work if it were open while I was away because she felt extremely lonely and was really struggling.

I couldn't be okay with the idea, she couldn't understand why and seemed to think it would be good for us. She had said that the only other way it would work out is if I put conditions on how long I'm away for. I'd told her for the future I will try to keep time away as short as possible, however, we have tours coming up that extend around the same time as the previous one and that I can't put any strict conditions on it.

She then claims that I've decided that the relationship is over.
A bit of time passes and she immediately back-pedals on the whole situation, claiming she could probably be okay without an open relationship, however, I decide that I can't possibly manage to deal with the situation until I'm home.

When I get home, she wants to talk. I get to her house, we talk for a while and it seems we have reached the conclusion that we both want different things and the relationship doesn't work. We chat for a while, then she decides we should be together and that she can convince me that an open relationship is fine. After a long discussion, she realises I don't feel comfortable with budging on how I feel about it and asks me to leave.

Since then I've moved back home (I was living with gf prior) and am receiving messages from her saying that she loves me, misses me, thinks she can be monogamous and okay with me going away. I don't know what to do.

Here's an example from earlier this week: My boyfriend recently interrupted me while I was talking about one of my best friends to ask if she was “full black”. I was not discussing ANYTHING regarding her race, just our plans to chill over summer break. He was totally dumbfounded when I acted surprised and mildly offended. I thought it was a totally inappropriate and insensitive thing to ask, but he continually tried to justify it defensively when I asked him why that was relevant.

We were together for about 10 months. It was a good relationship, but it isn't what I'd call sophisticated. This was before I had a car of my own. Other obstacles prevented us from having a deeper relationship, our age being the biggest one. I didn't really look at these factors until recently. 

I met my current girlfriend during my first year of college and we hit it off immediately. I'll call her Girl B. During this time, I started to feel distance between me and Girl A. She was into performance arts and spent most of her time with her theater friends, and that was a problem for me. I broke up with her. A few weeks later, I asked Girl B out. That was almost 3 years ago. 

Throughout my relationship with Girl B we have had some problems here or there. But we worked through them. About 7 months ago I almost broke up with her because I wasn't feeling as strong. Since then, things have been better than ever.

My girlfriend of 1 year and I met through a good mutual friend [F]. I've known this friend for like 10 years now. After we start dating I find out that this friend had a crush on me for a while now. 
After she found out we were dating she got quite upset and her and my girlfriend's friendship ended. I had no feelings toward her and let her know what was going on and we still kept in touch every so often as friends. This friend ended up moving away shortly after and neither my girlfriend nor I have spoken to this friend in about 8 months. My girlfriend was really mad at this friend for reasons unclear to me and even after trying to talk about it she just shrugs off the whole situation.


After this friend moved my relationship with my girlfriend was going good. It did however feel to me as if it were dwindling in the recent months. I'm at university studying engineering which takes up a lot of time through studying and such. Due to this we weren’t able to do as much as we used to. This resulted in us fighting at points because she felt like ""you don't love me anymore because we don’t do anything"" and ""you're always too busy to spend time with me"" as to make me feel like I'm a ""bad boyfriend."" I understand her feelings and realize she needs me but I give here every spare second of my life it just is never enough. My future career is very important to me and I've worked so hard thus far to let it go and slack off now.


She's also stated multiple times that she wants to get married soon. I am in no way ready for this and this isn't even in my mind yet (and I'm not budging on this one).
She also seems to be drifting farther away from me as the weeks pass. She's going to the clubs every week getting drunk, and hiding things from me. When I try to talk to her about it it is a real struggle and most of the times it just ends up with her being mad at me for being nosy and says she needs her privacy. I understand she needs this privacy and I do trust her but I just feel she is hiding something and I don't like it.  


So back to talking about this friend:


About a month ago this friend starts talking to my girlfriend again and they become friends again. This friend ends up coming back for two weeks to visit. During this time they hang out daily and leave me ignored by both of them. I asked my girlfriend what was going on and she stated she didn’t want me hanging out with this friend as it made her uncomfortable. She claimed this friend still acts the way she used (all touchy feely with everyone) and doesn’t want her to be around me, even though all 3 of us know we are just friends. I respect my girlfriend’s uncomfortable feeling but also would like to see this friend as I haven’t seen her in almost a year. 


I feel like she is trying to control everything I do. I have sacrificed so much for her over the past year and I feel almost used. Just the other day me and my girlfriend were planning on hanging out as soon as I was off work so I turned down the invitation to go out with some buddies of mine. She ends up texting me later that afternoon saying she was going to hang out with this friend instead leaving me alone with my thoughts.

 This is when I thought back on our relationship and these points I have stated and the reason why I am writing this now. I know at that time I was a bit upset and the bad things were emphasized due to this. We have had a lot of great time together and these bad things are to not overshadow this but they are still present.

He's suggested me meeting his mom more frequently now since I've met so many of his other family members, but I really don't want to. 

The first time we talked about his mom was about four months into our relationship, it had been like a month since he had met my parents... 
he told me his mom wanted him to date someone really pretty and that she might not like me because she probably wouldn't think i was good enough for him. That hurt, I may not be the prettiest girl in the world but I don't think I'm ugly. 

he said I just wasn't as feminine as the girl his mom wanted him to date but that it was okay with him or whatever. (I'm pretty femme though I wear dresses, and cute tops with jeans) 
*~*apparantely he has an uncle whose wife left him for another woman and she was tomboyish so his family kind of assumes that not being feminine = liking girls*~*
I do like girls but I like boys as well and I don't think that has anything to do with the way I dress.

I didn't put that much importance on that because he said he didn't really mind if I met his mom or not.

a few months later we were talking and he told me that his mom had been asking him questions about me. She asked him if I dressed girly again and that maybe if I didn't I was into girls only (she doesn't know i'm bisexual) and only with him because I wanted to marry him in order to get my citizenship.
(I'm an immigrant and getting married would solve my citizenship status but I wouldn't marry someone for just that, I've had offers before and I've refused and it's a really delicate subject for me and he knows it. Life is hard as an immigrant- his mom married someone for her citizenship so I guess that's why she assumed that of me.) It really hurt because that's an awful thing to say about someone and makes it seem like I'm some sort of goldigger which he's made me feel like before.

These are the reasons I don't really want to meet his mom, and on top of that we have other issues

Background: We met on an online game and started talking. After a week or 3 we were talking/skyping/playing for hours and hours. He has some vacation time left and decided to come and meet me. Only 1 month after meeting me online (Different countries) We really hit it off and been regularly seeing each other and even though it's a long distance we managed to visit often. (Every 2/3 weeks) We went to a Germany for a week, I visited his home country for many weekends, longest being visit 5 days. We got to know each other very well. And I'm very inlove with him. I've been cheated on in the past, after 3 years with my ex. And he has also been through it, so I thought he'd understand where I was coming from.

Problem: There is this girl 'His friend' he's being playing another game with (WOW) I'm not really into it. I tried it for a day or so for him. But I just don't like it. She is apparently 'married' with two kids, and from my home country. And she wants to come meet him in the New Year. He asked me if I was cool with that. I obviously wasn't because first of all, that's how we met.. And second of all.. Last night during a Team-speak conversation with me, bf and two others she jokingly said she had a crush on him and now she wants to meet him?!?! I'm not sure she has told her husband, and what his opinion is about this.

Red flags!!!! 

I haven't confronted her about it yet, he just told me this afternoon. He did say he doesn't see her any different to a guy friend, and that they've been friends for so long. We had an argument about it. He said that ,and I'll quote him on it '' Nothing is going to happen'' should be enough to settle any doubts. 

However it doesn't.. I'm not sure what to do, it is a dealbreaker for me. And I know that I'm only 18 and will have many other relationships after this one, and that this isn't that huge.. But it currently is to me.

127674,Relationships,2t7tr6,"Hi all! So, just as the title says, my girlfriend and I are planning on moving in very soon, this upcoming March (her apt lease ends at that time).  Right now we are living in separate apts, but we see each other every day without fail (either I go over to her place, or she comes over to mine).  

When we first decided that we wanted to move in together, she was so excited about it.  We talked about our future place together in detail, i.e. what neighborhoods, how we wanted to decorate it, what kind of dog we're going to get together, etc.  However, as we move towards March, she's become increasingly stressed out about the move. To the point that when we hang out, she seems unengaged and uninterested in the things that we're doing together.  We've had multiple conversations about this, and sometimes she feels a lot better afterwards, but the stress always comes back.

One major point of stress is that my gf's mother is a pastor, and she is convinced that her mother will be vehemently against it.  She had a rough patch a little while back with her mom, and since then their relationship has improved a lot, and is now better than ever.  She's worried because she knows that this move will again cause a rift between them, and she does not want to upset her mother. Her father left their family a few years ago, which obviously caused everyone in her family immense pain-- so now, my gf feels even more guilty, and almost can't stand the thought of going against her mom on something like this.

Another major point of stress for my gf is that she says that she is afraid that we will move in together and eventually break up.  She admitted to me that she's basically ready to get married right now, and although I love her very much and I can definitely see us getting married, I feel like I'm not ready yet.  However, i'm 100% committed to her, and I can't figure out what to do.  It hurts me to see her so worried about this, because I don't know why she would think that.  She basically said that she can't move in with me, and not marry me, because that would crush her.  I don't know what to do.

120222,Relationships,1j6kas,"We've been together for 18 months, and my thoughts are just starting to turn to the future (will we ever live together? Is this intended to be long term? Etc).

I don't make a lot or have a degree yet I don't want to move in with him or get married or have kids yet, or for a long time, and I've been very careful to make sure that nothing unexpected happens, but having children and being married is something that I expect to happen at some point, it's important to me.

Take children for example, at first he told me straight up that he *never* wanted to reproduce since it would interfere with his introversion as he calls it, he also never wants to share his space with anyone else (he can afford to move out now, but he doesn't think that he should have to have room mates so he's saving for his own house). Then he started to come around, I didn't ever try to persuade him, children just come up in conversation, saying that he dreamed we had a little girl and started saying about names he liked and stuff. He even said that he hoped she'd be a daddy's girl. Then today, on the phone, he said that there was no way he'd get up in the night to feed a kid and become a light sleeper (dude is evangelical about his bedtime, last time we went out to dinner past 9pm he fell asleep on the table) so he'd never have any children. I was kind of upset but said nothing, he said if I wanted a baby I could buy sperm and have one, so long as it didn't interfere with our relationship too much and he didn't get stuck living with it. Yeah no thanks.

He felt the same about marriage, first he said it was bullshit and people just did it for tax reasons, then he asked for my ring size and preference one day, a few months later I gently asked why he said that, he said that he'd changed his mind and had never intended to get married, the ring question was just for possible reference at some point in the future if he changed it back. 

I admit I was a bit pissed off, and he told me I was obsessed with settling down and that if I stopped wanting to maybe he'd *start* wanting to so I needed to stop asking and let him come to a decision eventually.

I was assaulted when I was 17 and subsequently became pregnant but lost the baby, so I probably think about it more than I should for my age, but I don't think I'm obsessed by any means, I've never even asked for children or tried to change his mind, I've just casually said that it's part of my plan for my life like 10 years from now. 

I'm probably not going to leave the guy over it, at least not now, it's just annoying, and I'll admit that I'm scared of getting to my late 30's when he finally decides he wants kids after teasing me with it for years and suddenly it's too late. 

I need to talk to him about it but I end up getting mad and ending the conversation so that nobody starts getting really furious. Can you guys suggest strategies?

68564,Relationships,2m3qhk,"Background: we're both in our very late twenties, and both hadn't been in a relationship for a few years until we met two months ago. There was an instant click and within a week we were dating, and another week later it was 'official'. We are incredibly in love with each other. We have moved really fast - we have met each others' families, spent almost every day together, and so on, but we have discussed this and decided that we were both comfortable with it. And I really am. But...

Every few days, something in her behaviour randomly 'pisses me off', as it were. It doesn't make me angry, it's more like something about her suddenly makes me sad and want to distance myself from her, as if my soul is telling me to move away from this girl and stop this nonsense.

Example: tonight is the first night in a week that we are not together, having spent the whole week doing stuff and going places. My plan was to go home and get some time to myself, send emails, do some work around the house, that sort of thing. I did. She however sent me a message after work saying she was going to a friend's place for dinner and wine.

Completely out of nowhere, that pissed me off, kind of like I had wanted for her to do the same as me and take some time for herself. She has some work to do and I know there's lots that she hasn't gotten around to so maybe I am thinking this is her running away from those responsibilities. Possibly.

But whatever the reason, it is so incredibly minor. I don't want to give a hoot about this at all, everyone is different, and some people just need to be around other people constantly - but here I am sitting feeling more and more annoyed about it. And she doesn't have a clue that she's done something 'wrong' (only in my mind). 

That's just an example, but it happens fairly consistently and I am wondering why I am doing this to myself. She is lovely, such a fantastic person, and I really want and see this working. But minor things keep affecting me and I cannot hide it from her, which creates an imbalance in our relationship because it's like I am picking on all her 'flaws' (again, only in my mind) and she feels it.

How can I get over this and treat her the way she deserves to be treated? I have absolutely no issues with her on a rational level, but my feelings don't listen to my brain. I don't understand why things affect me the way they do. Has anyone been in a similar situation before, and if so, did it go away with time? Or how do you 'snap out of it' ?

Is this true? Do aunts and uncles usually go out of their way to be at the hospital when the baby is born by taking off from work when it happens? I just never really thought it was a thing, I most definitely want to be there but if I have work I feel it will have to wait.

The worst part is that his girlfriend doesn't care (or maybe know) at all, and she has enough problems of her own to try and help him (which drives me absolutely crazy, but that's my personal opinion).
I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do to help him, other than to talk to him when he's struggling (which I am happy to do; he has helped me through my lowest points). And I know that this post makes him sound really bad, but he isn't. He's a good student, captain of his lacrosse team, and is a really loyal, and genuine person. I don't want him to lose all of that, and I know that he doesn't either. What should I do, as his best friend? I worry about him a lot and I want him to be okay.

So as a average looking guy I've just started looking through the hellhole called Online dating. However, I've run into some strange girls that answers all the questions I ask etc but don't really ask me any questions. 

One of the girls I've been talking too havent visited my profile yet, yet she answers each mail .. tho without any real questions or just a short ""You then?"" 

Is it because shes not really intrested or just bad at chatting? Should I cut my losses or keep trying to get her to open up?

85971,Relationships,2w6hup,"It all started a few weeks ago when my wife (28) (I am 30) of four years asked if I would be interested in a threesome to spice things up a bit,  immediately I got a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach but decided to at least talk about it with her, upon further discussion the proposal turned out the be two threesomes because she would only be interested in a threesome with 2 men while I would only be interested in a threesome with 2 women.  I was unable to make a decision and i told her that I needed to think about it.


After i slept on it I bought the subject up and said that I could not imagine sharing her with another man and I was unsure what lasting effects this would have on our marriage, and that I did not think jeopardizing our marriage was worth a bit of fun.  She said that's ok and if I changed my mind or wanted to talk about it later to let her know.


A few days later she got out of bed to have a shower to get ready for work I decided to check her phone because I had noticed that she had been spending more time on it and staying up later than me for the last couple of nights (we always go to bed at the same time).  On her phone there was a message to one of her friends saying that she didn't think people should be with just one person and a guy had been flirting with her and she liked it.


I didn't know what to do so I sat down and thought about what I was going to say.  When she got out of the shower and dressed i asked who is this other guy, she replied what other guy.  I mentioned the message to her friend and she said that she had been flirting and sent a couple of messages to this guy.  I asked her to be honest, asked her how long it had been going on for and how many messages, she said a couple of days and 10 maybe 20 messages. I didn't know what else to say so I said I had to go to work and we would talk about it later.


When I got to work I checked her phone message history on her bill, she sent this guy 200+ messages over about a week and a half (which coincides with the first discussion we had about the threesome)


I sent her a message to make sure this was going to end with this guy and asked if she still wanted to be with me.  She said yes and ended it (it took her 11 messages to this guy to end it).


I rung her at work and she said she was leaving early so I left at the same time, I told work the kids were sick and i had to go home.


We met back at home and I asked her about the messages, how many she answered again 20 or so they were just flirting, I told her how many messages she actually sent.  She pretended to be shocked, but I could tell she knew how many messages there were.  I asked her about the threesome suggestion and if he was the guy she was wanting to bring in.  She admitted it was.


Over the time this was going on I am pretty adamant that they have not met up but I think that is only because I caught onto what was going on early.


During one of our numerous conversations about this she said that I needed to get over it and I never asked why she did it.  The reason she gave was because I don't show her enough affection.  As hard as it is to admit it is true.  So I have been making more of an effort.
What makes me so angry about the whole situation is how vindictive she was trying to set this up, and the fact that trust has never been an issue for us and now because of this it is and possibly always will be.

Is there any advice anyone can offer to me I will be working though this with her but has it happened to anyone else and am I handling this the best way?

182940,Relationships,1pcyky,"I'll start with some backstory: My girlfriend and I have been together for over 4 years, and we've been through all kinds of problems together. Our relationship has had some major points of contention, from cutting and ED to depression, but we've mostly overcome these things. We live 3 hours away from each other, at least while I'm off at college. We've been long-distance for over two years.

I have a very close-knit group of friends. I've been friends with some of these guys for over 12 years, and we're pretty much inseparable. We have an online voice chat (Skype, then Mumble) that pretty much runs 24/7. Most of the day, at least some of us are in there, watching YouTube videos, playing games with each other, or just chatting about random shit. We all have a lot of stuff in common, and really enjoy hanging out with each other.

The problem comes with balancing the two in my life, and keeping both my girlfriend, and my friends happy. This problem gets worse during breaks from school, when I return home.

When my friends and I hang out in person, we usually like to sit around, play video games, smoke weed, and drink fortys. We don't always do the last two, but a lot of the time, we do. Not everybody in the group participates, but I typically do. My friends are loud, obnoxious people, and we really like to do crazy things, tell wild stories, and have fun.

When my girlfriend and I spend time together, it is usually a more quiet occasion, and we just cuddle, watch TV, have sexy times, and talk about things. My girlfriend is a quiet, reserved person, who doesn't really have any other friends than myself. Pretty much, she's the polar opposite of my friends. Social situations make her anxious, she hates that I smoke weed and drink sometimes, and she doesn't really participate in any of the activities that we do (playing video games, watching comedy videos, etc).

During breaks, I try to balance time between the two and myself. Most nights, my girlfriend comes over. We spend time together, and do our thing. However, on weekends especially, my friends like to come and party. My girlfriend doesn't want to leave when this happens, and problems arise. She gets upset if I ask her to leave, and refuses to do so, but also gets upset if she stays around me and my friends while we party. Sometimes she will break down crying and I have to go comfort her, other times she just looks annoyed, sometimes, she argues with me, and other times, she just sits and doesn't participate in anything. This makes my friends uneasy, and ""kills the buzz"" of the party. It's gotten to the point where my friends are apprehensive about coming over or doing anything if they know she is going to be around.

I try explaining to her that I want some time alone with her, but that I also want time with my friends. She then argues that I care more about my friends than about her. I try to explain that I care about both of them, and want to balance the two, but this often isn't enough. Just the other day, she asked me who I would choose if I could either see only her or my best friend ever again. I couldn't decide, and this pissed her off, because ""she was the obvious choice"". It doesn't help that she really dislikes my best friend, either. She sees him as obnoxious, a horrible person, and a bad influence.

Last weekend, one major issue arose when I realized that I had three plans already made for one night. I had told my friends that I would go camping with them that night, I had told her that I would go to a haunted house with her that night, and it was my mom's birthday, so I was taking her to dinner. I really wanted to do all three, but I ended up choosing to go to the haunted house with my girlfriend, and not going camping with my friends. I ended up taking my mom to dinner the next day, when the place was less crowded. One of my other friends who didn't go camping wanted to hang out, so I told him he could come and hang out with us. My girlfriend was okay with this at first, but when my friend wanted to smoke weed, she got pissed off, because she hates when I do that, even though I really enjoy it. I smoked it anyway, but this pissed her off. 

The next day, my last day in town, my friends wanted to visit me, and my girlfriend said she would leave at around 9PM to go home and spend time with her sisters. This worked out, as my friends would come after my girlfriend left. At around 8PM, she got really upset with me because she ""knew that my friends would smoke weed and drink with me"". She demanded that I promise her that I wouldn't do those things, but I knew I would, so I didn't promise her anything. This pissed her off, and she ended up not leaving at all that night. I convinced her to behave a little better while my friends were over, and she did, but she was upset when she overheard them asking why she was still there. It was still a bit awkward for some of my friends, though, as they could tell that she wasn't having fun and didn't really want them there. They left early because of this.

This weekend is shaping up to be problematic, as well. My girlfriend wants to come up to visit me in college, but my fraternity is having a party, and they invited me and my friends, who have been looking forward to this since the last party a couple of months ago. I've tried explaining to her that this isn't a good weekend, and that any other weekend would work a lot better, as we would get more alone time, but she's still really upset, and plans on coming regardless. Again, she is arguing that I care more about my friends than about her, and is angry about the fact that we party at all to begin with. I know that if she goes to the party, it probably won't be fun for her or anybody else involved. I had told her about a week ago that it would be fine for her to come over this weekend, but I had forgotten about the party, and I'm really bad with dates.

I just don't know what to do. She'll probably post in this thread with a bit about how she feels, but I just don't understand what I should do about this. I love her, but I also love spending time with my friends. I just really wished that everybody meshed well together.

I'll try to be completely honest. Wife's a Hindu Punjabi mixture and I am a Christian guy. During the marriage  we knew each other for two months of office. So you can say I took the plunge after knowing a girl for 2 months. I wish I knew about live-in relationship concept back then. Anyways I won't cry about the past. Career wise I am doing good but she is doing just fine, not really focussed on one thing or ambitious types. She's more concerned about how to kill time during the day and not too serious about money, work, finances etc. Get a gossip monger around her who talks about suits, sarees, silly trips to the market and what happened during those trip and she is happy. So I married a typical Indian housewife.

When we dated I thought I was marrying a liberated working woman who knows what she wants in life. And maybe she had her own perceptions about whom she is getting married to. I'm to afraid to ask her that, afraid that we'll have another argument. That has led to lesser and lesser communication between us. She has her upsides too, like she's a great cook and house keeper. But you know somehow we get too hung up on a person's bad qualities, since  we want nothing but the best out of our partners.

It's our fault too, we didn't lay down the terms before getting married. Like I could've told her what I need in a wife and she could've told me what she's looking for in a husband. We didn't do any of that, we just thought we'll make a good couple and took the plunge. Well even if we had laid the terms I am sure we would've lied with a smile to each others faces about our expectations. I guess that is why Love is called blind, It does not make you blind literally but it blurs out the ability to think rationally and practically. And then the Marriage clears out that blur for you and shows you the finger.

I read somewhere we show people our personality when we fall in love, but marriage brings out the real character.

Anyways our current situation:

I don't live with my parents, I don't pay anything to my parents, they get pension so thankfully I don't have to worry about their finances. Dad and Mum both are a a bit ill and need regular checkups and medicines. So it's understandable that she never cooks for them, never has to do their laundry or work. Wife and parents hardly communicate apart from normal salutations and few casual things. It's just me, my wife and my 1 year old son.

Early stages of our marriage everything was like a fairytale. Waking up kissing each other , talking on the phone, getting jealous when guys are talking to your wife. Going out to restaurants for dates etc. But then the problems started to creep up. Why don't you look for a job that pays more? Why don't we shift our house to some place bigger/better? 
And then these perceptions from her side started to occur about my parents. “Your mom does not like me”, “I can feel it”, “my instinct never lies” and shit like that. Now my mom pokes around a lot but I know when she likes/dislikes someone. She's my mother for crying out loud, I know her nature and she well liked you, but if you keep going on saying “she does not like me”, “she irritates me” etc. I'm ought to feel that my wife is a whiner.


So this whole ugly family feud starts which is hard to manage. We start throwing these stupid pointless insults at one another. And to make matters even worse we have a small child, who, I am afraid will listen to these arguments which is not a good thing for the child. She is his mother and I respect that aspect – But I am starting to get irritated when she yells at others in front of him.  

Believe me, Yelling, Shouting, talking like a goon, frowning while talking about a normal daily thing (like picking up the groceries) is like her only way of communicating. And I wonder where does all this come from. I feel she is trying to dominate us or play the upper hand in our lives. It feels like I married an ill-mannered bloke trapped inside a woman's body. When will this stop.

All this has taken a toll on my life and now almost everything about her has started to annoy me. Even the way she eats her food, the way she sits the way she behaves. I know I am being too judgemental, but how to make it all go away and better my life. I miss my bachelor life at times.

37974,Relationships,2sec7a,"I am 35 Male who lived all my life in India and work in the IT sector with a reasonably stable job. She is 35 F from Paris, lived mostly in France but traveled a lot, doesn't have big college education due to family issues. We met because of a shared interest through the internet and also because she loved and traveled to India many times.



We are living together in a metropolis in India for 19 months and married since 5 months. 
She has been accepted and loved by my parents and family and we visit them once in 2 months or so. Her family (mother and step sister) visited us for the marriage and we had a great 2 week trip with them. 



Prior to that I had a string of long term relationships but none materialized to marriage and she too had the same, only difference was she was living with her BF's. We both suffered from anxiety and depression issues and also took medications for that. All this shared history, common issues and shared interests were good enough for us to live together and get married, although we had a lot of anxious times in the run-up to the marriage. We both didn't believe in marriage because of the broken marriages we saw in our respective families. Her mother had divorced from her father and married another man and did not have any contact with her throughout her teen years. My parents though stayed together but have been fighting almost everyday all throughout my childhood.  But when we met and saw the connection with each other we both thought this was the person.



We are generally very happy with each other and seem to still have a strong connection and great sex life. We are waiting for another 6 months to have her work authorization in India.
She has generally adjusted very well to India, helping out with buying groceries, keeping the house with the help of maids etc. But she feels alone many times due to her inability to speak Hindi fluently (she did a 1 month course but needs practice), because she is still staying at home and like me she an introvert. 


Our relationship started after she decided to leave her 7 years old live-in partner, but she says she was planning to do it for last 3 years and was tempted only when she found me. 
I was in a 3 years dysfunctional relationship also without the courage to separate or take it to the next level. Around the beginning she looked at my chat history and found me flirting with another girl (happened when she has went back to renew her visa). The jist was at that time I was not sure how this relationship will go, will she go back and change her mind and move in again with her BF or come back to India, I really didn't trust her completely. Also I was uncomfortable to share our live-in relationship status with everyone in India since it is frowned upon. So I just chatted with this girl on facebook and told her I was NOT in a relationship and just praised her a bit. This single incident created a huge furore, she still can not completely get over it even when I have deleted that woman from my facebook and have no contact with her. Further I have tried my best to reassure her that nothing is going in her back even leaving my email accounts open and offering to leave my phone at home. But the issue still remains in the back of her head.



The problem is that we have been having really ugly fights which have recently escalated to hitting each other. It starts with varied reasons - trust issues, sharing finances, sharing housework etc which I think can be solved if we argue with reason but we both loose our temper. She starts shouting on me and then I react with disproportionate force - including name calling and then sometimes hitting each other. During the run-up to the marriage we both thought it was just temporary stress but now it looks like ingrained. We bring up the bad thing we have done in the past - my alleged cheating via facebook chat and her abandoning her BF for 7 years in a matter of days, and then it escalates.



She says I am an abusive person, which I admit (partly because of my alcoholic and abusive father). I have started to see a counselor just last week to resolve my abuse issues. She has agreed to take therapy as well for her over-reactions, trust issues and feelings of being abandoned. I am not at all justifying the abuse because of her behavior, it is my problem that needs to resolved by me. I am researching about abuse on the internet and trying to get as much help as possible - given that we don't have much support networks for abuse perpetrators in India. In hindsight I feel I may have been rushed into our marriage, but it was unavoidable since otherwise we couldn't have carried on this long distance relationship. I took a leap of faith thinking our emotional bond will resolve all the issues. And right now I am very much in love with her and completely devoted to have my life with her forever and I want it to work whatever it takes.



I never thought going to the internet solves relationships issues, but in this case I think I can get help to have the western and independent perspective too which my local friends can not provide.  Question is are we doing it right, anything that might help us from personal or anecdotal experience. Please don't suggest we need to breakup because of both of us dont want that.

UPDATE - 16/01/2015: I just got an opportunity to travel out of the country for a week on work. Incidentally this is the same country where the woman I chatted with (story above, who I have cut all contact with now) resides. I am trying if my wife can come with me but it is not certain I may be able to (because of sharing the transport/lodgings with my work mate). This the first opportunity for me to travel abroad in my 13 years career and incidentally it has come now when me are in the midst of fixing ourselves. This has created a huge uproar between us. She feels I am going there to cheat on her. I have tried to reason with utmost patience -- that I want to take you with me, let us try to work out how best we can do that but no guarantees. But she doesn't want to listen to any of it and is thinking of leaving me. I am at a total loss of what to do now.

She has cut marks up and down her arms from high school and lacks confidence in herself, particularly in her mental abilities, because she wasn't a good student and her ""friends"" made fun of her for it. She thinks she's stupid.

We're both in the same major and taking many of the same classes.  I have a stronger background in the field and have always been a strong student, so I have helped her a lot throughout this semester.  She has struggled and at many times thought she couldn't get through it, but in the end she made it out with very good grades.  

She hasn't had a mental breakdown or done anything alarming, but I am afraid it could be under the surface.  I am constantly encouraging her and trying to prove to her that she isn't stupid and she has self-worth.  Usually it doesn't work.  I'm afraid this, on top of the help I give her with classes, will make her largely dependent on me, which is the opposite of what I want: I want her to gain her own confidence and be able to believe in herself and be happy, independent of me. Not that I want to break up with her, I just want her to be a healthy, whole human being.

I've never been depressed and am lucky enough to have a supporting family to encourage me and build me into the person I am today.

I have an issue that I've googled to no avail so I'm bringing it here.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. 

Before him, I dated my ex-boyfriend for 3 years. We broke up almost 2 years ago now. 

Ever since about the 3 month mark or so with my current boyfriend, whenever it is bedtime, even if it's the beginning of a whole weekend we'll be spending together, I get very emotional and sad about having to go to sleep. He usually falls asleep before me and it makes me feel a very deep sadness for seemingly no reason.

On the surface level, the issue is that I just want to keep hanging out and not go to sleep yet. But once he falls asleep, I start to feel more deeply sad and scared and longing, like I have to cherish this moment with him so close because it may not come again, or like the fact that he's sleeping means he doesn't care as much (which is obviously absurd). In the morning I'm always totally fine and the sadness has completely gone away. 

This never happened to me in my last relationship. I would be grumpy at bedtime sometimes but never to this extent. My last relationship was ended by my boyfriend very suddenly, so I'm thinking that this is due to a fear of abandonment? 

My current boyfriend is amazing, as is our relationship. He's very, very affirming and loving and affectionate.

Basically, I just want to know if anyone has experienced so that I know I'm not alone. And if you've discovered what seems to be the cause or anything that helps, that would be great too! 

Feel free to redirect if there's a better subreddit for this question.

Met my girlfriend at the very beginning of college and we hit it off very well. She was my first and i was her first real boyfriend. 

I was a virgin and she had only had sex with 2 other guys. We had many if not all similar interests, made each other laugh, etc etc. 

Fell in love HARD. I spent unbelievable amounts of time on her/with her and i loved it. But because of this, i spent less time on making other close friends. 

She was my best friend at school 100%. Things went well for a year and after that, it became rocky...she was always unsure of the future and i would always be willing to work through things and tell her that its worth it...we will get through it together.

 I wanted to be the rock she could come to. We were so open with each other and honest. close to the 2 year mark, neither of us was THAT happy because we both had the same routines every day. 

I also noticed over the last year or so, she would nitpick on things i did and was pretty mean to me at times but i figured it was just what girls do. 

We still spent tons of time together. We ended up breaking up in a way...mutually right before 2 years. 

We contacted after that and talked for a week while separated at christmas break, i wanted to try again and she decided after the week...that she didn't. 

Another week or so went by while we were still on the break and we started to talk again. I wanted to try and she didn't. 

She messaged me back later a few hours and was like ok...alright lets do it. We went back to school and i thought things were going great, i was at a decent level of happiness and loved her like crazy still. 

Out of nowhere, she went to a bar with her friend and slept with a guy. She said she left before it finished and cried home. She told me the next morning.

 I was pissed, hurt, heart broken...we talked a bit...i swore, we talked more and more. Went a few days without talking, then talked again. 

I decided i wanted to give her a second chance at the time, and she essentially told me she needs a month to think about it. After that we stopped talking. 

its been almost 2 weeks and ive decided that she doesn't deserve me because she didn't jump on that 2nd chance. If she needed a month, then it means her love for me wasn't true. 

Problem is we are in all of the same classes and i see her all the time. When im far away, i feel decent...but during the school week i feel like crap. She doesn't know why she did it apparently and wanted to figure that out and i don't really believe it.

 I figure she was already checking out of the relationship and did this to break up for good. What was even more selfish is that she couldn't even tell me that to my face the last time we spoke in person. 

I feel betrayed and i lost my best friend, the relationship, and my girlfriend. I don't want to think badly of her but how can someone do this, and just leave me in the dust.

 To say....i need a month and keep me waiting...even though i have already decided i wouldn't take her back. Its hard to believe there are other fish out in the sea because its my first girlfriend but im sure there are. 

To find one that has so many similar interests again might not be the easiest thing. I just don't know how i can get over this sooner and move on. I am not contacting her at all but i still have to see her. How do you people deal with something like this?

176096,Dating,2ri7zq,"My boyfriend and I are currently in university and have been dating for a year. I am his first girlfriend and he is an international student (I don't know why I have given the antecedent information, but maybe it'll shed light to this story).

We are doing well despite our past rough patches. But my problem isn't about the past. My problem is with his constant mentioning of a mutual female friend, Natalie, whenever we go out.

Back story: Natalie was introduced to me by a mutual friend, and we've become well acquainted ever since. She was a new transfer to our school and I introduced her to everyone I knew, hoping she could quickly make some friends and adjust to the new university life more easily.

Natalie is this happy-go-lucky girl who is independent and intelligent, and everyone around her can tell. It comes as no surprise that she is fun to go out with, and fun to hang around. Soon, she was on good-terms with my close friends and my boyfriend. 

The first couple of months at school, I would always invite Natalie to parties, seeing that she loves to go out but didn't have a crowd to go with. Soon after, she found her crew and started morphing her daily activities around/with them. This was obviously natural since everyone establishes and settles within their unique patterns of lifestyle and friends when they are well-adjusted. And, it's not as if we cut contact. We did our own things and caught up regularly. 

Now, it seems as if every time my group of friends and I are planning excursions, my boyfriend would say, ""You should invite Natalie"", or ""Natalie should come"". My boyfriend is not the type to suggest people to hang out with if he himself did not make the plan. He is not one to name drop a few mutual friends to make a party livelier or bring in a bigger crowd. If he were a person to habitually suggest other friends, this would not be that weird of a situation to me. However, he is definitely a ""whoever comes, joins"" kind of person.

The first couple of times he mentioned her name, I always thought, ""Good idea! She'd be fun to invite."" But the next several times, I would find it weird that he was only suggesting her and not other people. 

I don't usually keep track of the incidences, but a few popped into my mind. When he could not make it to my organization's formal party as my date, he suggested Natalie, out of all my other closer, best friends at the university. Moreover, out of the blue one day, he asked me if I thought Natalie was going to ask me to live with her for next year housing despite Natalie and I being not even as close as I am with my current suite mates. Furthermore, while we (my boyfriend, my home town friends, and I) were all making plans for spring break, he suggested Natalie as the 6th person to complete a 6-people cruise trip package. Keep in mind, Natalie is in no way connected to my home town friends. She is only known to my boyfriend and I, so inviting her seemed sudden and a bit irrelevant since none of the others knew her. But, granted, right after he suggested her name, he suddenly realized that it was weird, and he quickly said, ""Nope, nevermind."" Maybe it was the look I gave him, or the incredulous but quiet ""what?"" I said that made him realize he'd gone too far. 

No matter what, I find it really weird and bothersome that he constantly brings her up, EVEN when he has known her for a shorter time that I did, AND knowing fully well that I have other, CLOSER friends than her that I can also invite to outings.

We texted a lot, and when I broke up with my ex and moved out, Fred asked if i'd consider a relationship.

7170,Dating,2e4tr8,"**Little background on this story of mine.**

 I met this girl (let's call her Lena) on a trip to Indianapolis for a competition (Last month of my senior year in high school). We took a charter bus and some students from other schools joined in for a ride. She and I talk, I immediately like her. However, I know that she lives quite a ways from me (around 1 hour and 30 minutes away), so I never actually got her number or anything. I didn't want a relationship at the time, much less from someone so far away. Even though I didn't pursue it, she was still on my mind for a few weeks before I forgot about her.

----

**To the actual story/asking for advice**

Now, fast forward past the summer to college, I hear from a friend who went to the competition with me that Lena was going to this college as well. I'm actually willing to go for a relationship now, so I'm ecstatic. My friend (being the great wingman he is) gets her number for me the day before college starts, specifically telling her it's for me. She gives it to him and I start texting her.

Once again, we hit it off quite well. Once the first day of college starts, we're texting during class and we get to the topic of computers. She said that she had recently bought a laptop, but Microsoft Office wasn't in it. Luckily, I keep a completely-legal-and-not-torrented copy of Microsoft in my USB (being a nerd *finally* pays off!). I offer to get it on her computer and she says yes.

Fast forward to when classes are done, she invites me to her dorm (*hue hue hue*). I meet her roommates (3 other girls) and I surprisingly didn't make an idiot of myself. I install my Microsoft into her computer and even fixed a problem with their printer and now all 4 of them could print from it (I *knew* taking IT Essentials back in high school would help me score points with chicks). I stay for about an hour and we're all laughing and making jokes. 

Eventually I have to leave because I need to get home since I still live with my parents (fuck paying for dorms, that shit is too high). I say bye, she gives me a hug and I go my way. Later that night we text a couple of times:

    Lena: Thank you again dear 

    Me: It was my pleasure... dear?

    Lena: Lol. Btw, my roommates loved you

    Me: I do my best to impress. It'd be kinda awkward if they hated me

No more texts for that night. Next day we're in classes and we're just texting about how much it sucks. Once my class is done I ask her if she's doing anything for the next couple of hours, no reply. I leave the campus, but I come back later that night for an engineering party (yes, it was as boring as it sounds). Once again, I ask her if she wants to hang out since I was on the campus anyways. No reply.

24 hours later she hasn't texted me at all. I refuse to text her because I think I'd come off as desperate/cringey. 

Now, I'm not American (Filipino, decent looking), so I'm not sure if these pauses in communication are normal in American dating and I'm just overreacting. She (and her roommates) told me that I could hang out at her dorm anytime I want, but I don't want to just knock on their door willy-nilly. I was raised to always get permission before *every* visit, so it would feel weird just going up there. My friends come over to my house whenever, so I know that's how American friends work, but I always ask before I go to their house.

So, does she actually like me? Did I fuck something up? In my head, she doesn't like me since she doesn't even give the time for a text as simple as can't hang out at the moment, sorry. It's just that we hit it off so well, but maybe I was in over my head. I apologize for the wall of text, I needed to get this out and tell someone and ask for their opinion.

43426,Relationships,2wvkop,"We've been together since college, have two kids (7 and 2) and a harmonic family life. However, under the surface there have always been issues threatening our relationship: low self-esteem (for her) and trust issues (for both of us).

Her father died when she was 7, her mother was poor and emotionally cold, preferring her brother over her. My wife is a warm and outgoing person (I'm more of an introvert), very popular with other people, successful in her business, and above all a good person - but she admits to me that deep down she doesn't believe that about herself. She is constantly afraid that her friends and colleagues, and myself, will suddenly wake up and recognize her as a fake and a bad person. She tells me that the reason she spends every available hour with our kids is because she feels that they are only people that she feels will accept her as she is and never abandon her.

She tells me that she is afraid that I'm with her only for the sex and housekeeping. This is after 18 years of living together, being best friends, going through some hard personal times *always* supporting each other. She tells me that she knows this is not rational but that she cannot shake off that feeling. We started spending more time alone, hugging and talking for hours, skipping sex. We even did some trust exercises :)

And I have some trust issues too. At the beginning of our relationship we talked about how many sex partners we had before. I told her she doesn't *have* to talk about it, but she was okay with it and said that she wanted me to know everything. Couple of months pass and she informs me that she tested positive for an STD she got from an earlier sex partner I didn't know about. I was mad at the moment because I didn't believe that she really forgot about him. Then, some years after turns out she had another guy she failed to mention because it they never went beyond oral. Although we explicitly talked how oral is still sex, especially after we watched the same situation on Clerks. I told her that obviously she cannot be straight about it and that we should avoid talking about her sexual history altogether.

Then, about 10 years ago, we had a big relationship crisis. She accused me of being too controlling. She told me that she's not sure she loves me anymore. This went on for a year or so, and our relationship changed from good to bad on weekly basis. Then she kinda made out with a mutual friend of ours while I was with other friends in the next room. It's a funny story because she told me beforehand that she was attracted to him and to stop inviting him over. I laughed, said that she knows he is all wrong for her, that it's okay to have feelings she cannot control, but that it would be wrong to move on them behind my back. We agreed that it would be stupid to break up our circle of friends because of this silly infatuation. I trusted her so much that it never crossed my mind what they were doing in the next room.

Well, she came clean the same night, she cried a lot, I was mad and insisted that she breaks off contact with him until things cool down. Then a week later I find out that she was lying, and continued to text him. We continued to work on establishing trust again, and some months after that she admitted that she was sexting with a colleague from another country in the mean time. So I break up with her, she moves out, and for the first time since we started dating we spent some time apart. After a month or two we move in back together and things got much, much better. Apparently I'm not controlling anymore, and she really is a wonderful partner and a great mother.

But my trust has been severely damaged. With time I learned not to worry about her actions and movements. However, I still feel that she is not opening up to me the way that our relationship deserves. I think that we haven't resolved some of the loose ends from our past and she is very defensive if I try to bring it up. I feel that she is too reserved in sex and rejects my attempts to (very mildly) spice it up, even the things we loved to do when we were in our 20s. I get very frustrated when her reasons don't make any sense - I feel they are not only untrue but also insulting.

Our relationship started in the spring of last year. We spent an amazing summer together but then had to go long distance as we went to different schools (4 hours apart). We never went more than 4 weeks without seeing each other during that time and everything seemed great. She is a year older than I, but had never had a boyfriend before. I have had a few serious relationships, but this was no doubt the best one I have ever been in. She was a virgin prior to dating me as well, which really meant a lot to me that she trusted me to be her first time.

As the summer came to an end, I would be heading back to school and she would be staying home beginning her career as she had graduated in the spring. Within the span of a week we went from good morning I love you texts to a weekend of close to no communication leading to her breaking up with me the following Monday. I was quite blindsided. She said that she just didn't think I was the person she would spend her life with. That I had certain personality traits that while not inherently bad, she didn't see herself being with someone like that for the rest of her life. 


It was a hard thing for me to hear. However after a week or two of trying to convince her otherwise, I had to go back to school and gave up. We didn't talk for a few weeks and I tried to forget about her. After a time she would try to contact me. Sometimes I would stay strong and either ignore her or keep things short until she left me alone. However other times I would break and we would talk and everything would feel right. I told her that talking to me like this would give me too much hope for us. She said she didn't want to do that, yet continued to contact me from time to time. 


This continued until one break we ran into each other out at a bar. She was all over me, telling me how she missed me and grabbing at my dick while telling me she wanted to have sex. I told her it wasn't fair of her to act like this and I couldn't just have sex without there being a future to us. 


Since then she has continued to text me, call me and snapchat me from time to time. It is just so aggravating because I would love to get back together with her, yet she continues to say she does not want to get back together. At the same time she pulls all these stunts. Just today she told me how she mentions to her family from time to time that we still talk. Said lots of them ask her if we will get back together. All of these things make me feel like she does want to get back together and it really keeps me from being able to move on. And obviously I'm battling myself just on the idea of wanting to move on.


I know this is reddit and the majority of the responses will be along the lines of delete facebook, hit the gym, lawyer up. Move on and stop talking to her. I guess I just want to hear what other people think of the situation and maybe I'll finally get the kick in the ass I need.

There's a woman I love. We're both in our mid-30s, have known each other for several years, were in a long distance relationship for one year, and have finally been living in the same city for five months. We want children. 


Adjusting to living near each other hasn't been as easy as we hoped. We planned to move in together as soon as I arrived; she wanted to take a step back and give the relationship time to develop. I understood, but her way of doing this felt, to me, like being pushed away. She acknowledged this eventually and admitted that she made a mistake in setting us down this path of living apart.


There was damage done - we fell into a routine of maintaining separate lives, seeing each other a few times a week, and not taking care of the relationship. It felt horrible. I choked back confronting her about some of this because I felt she was responsible for establishing distance between us, and I thought (foolishly!) that if I dished it back she'd come to her senses. And then she gave me the news...


Pregnant. I was so happy. I mean, look, I get that the relationship needed work and that this was by no means a solution to our problems. But we knew each other well enough, I think, to know that this was something we could take on together... At least until she gave me the second bit of news... It might not be mine. She had been out a few weeks before with colleagues, was bitter and angry at me, was convinced I was moving on, and was very drunk... And went home with a guy that night. 


This all came at me fast. She framed it to sound like it was most likely his, she had even told him first (he wants nothing to do with it, told her to abort). I told her to give me my keys, pack up her stuff, and get out. 


It's been three weeks from that night. She's keeping it. Once I cooled down, I began communicating with her again. She's made a point of insisting there's no way to know whose it is, that it might also be mine (timing and our birth control bad habits make this believable). I told her that, yes, I love her, yes, I think we can have a healthy relationship if we approach it mindfully and with effort, yes, I want to start a family with her, but no, I can't do that with a child who's not mine (old fashioned, maybe, but it goes back to some unpleasant bits of my family history). 


She wants me in her life, wants many of the same things I do, and she also wants this baby. She's willing to do it alone, though it will require going back to her parents for support. 


So the question... What's the question? This kind of thing must happen more often than I realize. I can walk away - is that so unreasonable? We can work at this - I'm insisting that we start seeing a counsellor sooner rather than later. She's into week 7. If she carries this child all the way, if I find out then it's not mine... I've read a little about situations like this, the partner who's been put in my situation, there by the hospital bed, who holds a baby for the first time and stops caring who the real father is... Can I do that? Or can I be with her through the experience, through the childbirth, and then leave her on her own if it turns out not to be mine? 


We've had four talks since this all happened. This is all still a vortex of conflicting thoughts and feelings. 


I've spoken to only guy friends about this and there's a bias there towards the male genetic imperative of not expending my resources on what is potentially another guy's child. I'd like to find others who have been through this type situation and hear about experiences. Were you able to make a relationship work? What challenges did you face?

Our family Thanksgiving dinners are huge. Probably at least 30 people including the kids. As such, there is a massive amount of food to cook and dishes to clean. I have no problem pitching in, but the problem lies in that it's only the women who do it while the men watch TV or play video games, something I had only noticed after this holiday.

This year I ended up in the basement playing video games with the guys. It did not cross my mind that what I was doing what out of the ordinary, and the guys I was playing with did not notice anything either. We all had a blast! It was after dinner and during the drive home that my mom let it all spill.

The family was disappointed in me for not helping out with the dinner preparations and clean-up. Apparently, they had all just stood around gossiping about me in the kitchen because I wasn't helping out and instead was downstairs playing games. My mom was disappointed too. I felt bad.

It did not occur to me until we got home that none of the men have ever been asked to help out upstairs in the kitchen. This bothers me a lot because my uncles and male cousins have never left the basement in all our years of holidays dinners. Now I do it once and the whole female side of the family thinks I'm selfish?

On one hand I feel bad about being lazy and not helping prepare, but on the other hand I don't think I should be obligated to help out while none of my male relatives are.

for months and months I've been trying to write this post but couldn't, because I always feel lost whenever I try to think about just exactly what is wrong. But here I am, alone in the house at night (I'm on the other part of the globe), finally giving myself to ruminate on what's been happening in this relationship.


Let's start with the basics: we have been dating for 9 months and are now living together. Another important fact is that we are in a D/s relationship, him being my Dom and I his submissive. Because of this relationship dynamic, he tells me what to do / what not to do often and assigns me tasks.


For example, I am not allowed to meet guys or talk to them. If I do, I keep an email log of such events and notify him. I am not allowed to go to social events where I can meet guys by myself. 


Another thing that characterizes our relationship is my cuckquean tendencies (meaning, I gain sexual pleasure from watching my man with other women). However, I have just begun to explore this side of my sexuality with him and realized that it's caused pain rather than pleasure majority of the time, simply because I feel jealous and insecure in such situations when I am not sexually aroused.


This tendency combined with our D/s relationship means that he's able to talk to and sleep with other women although I cannot interact with males. This doesn't mean that he got a free pass with whatever he did - recently he agreed to not engaging in sexual activities/flirting with other women when I am not there. 


Though he's made many compromises himself in order to help me feel secure, I am beginning to doubt if I can be happy in this sort of engagement anymore. Don't get me wrong - it works for some people, and props to them. I've engaged in/watched sexual activities with him and another girl and it was a big turn on for me. But when I am not  in the right mood - that is, 80 percent of the time - I am anxious about it. 


I dread going out with him because he will openly - and rightfully so - check out and comment on how hot other girls are. Whenever a decent looking girl is introduced to us, I know he sees her as a potential third and it hurts me. Yes, I think this is what hurts me most; in normal relationships you don't expect your boyfriend to see all girls as potential sexual partners, but with this man, I am afraid of introducing him my girlfriends or meeting new people with him because I know what will be going on in his head.


We discussed this problem numerous times, and there seems to be nothing that can be done about this. Whenever I bring up the possibility of sexual monogamy he acts as though something has been taken from him. (I understand this reaction..) I told him that I want to know if we can be monogamous first before we open the relationship up, that I don't want threesomes to be a necessity; he says it isn't, but he regularly talks about it and asks me to post ads on various websites to the point I feel like he won't be satisfied in the relationship without those things.


When I first explored cuckqueandom it was fun and exciting and sexy. I felt powerful and desirable. But now I find myself daydreaming about a normal relationship where the guy feels no need to be with other women in order to feel satisfied in our relationship. I dream about being loved and appreciated for who I am (he likes super skinny girls and has told me to eat less because he wants me skinnier. I am 5'3'' 110 lbs). 


Little by little, I am beginning to resent him. I resent him when he's talking to other girls or hanging out with them although I know he won't be flirting with them as he promised. I resent him when he nags me about what I'm doing wrong around the house. I resent him when he gives me a hard time about not finishing my to do list on time when he himself works 12 hrs a week and watches football in his free time. 


I think about my life without him. I just started a full time job that pays well enough for me to get a new apartment. My new job also allows me to travel around the world and live wherever I want. But when I think about actually going through the break up, and having to pack up my things and leave, I freeze. I can't hurt him. I've tried to leave numerous times in the past, but always ended up coming back because I loved him and I couldn't bear the thought of hurting him.


So Instead,I begin to think about the good moments we have, our future plan of moving to the Philippines, until I am once again reminded of the fact that he'll always want another girl and I'm back in the pit. 


I know the best thing to do in this situation is just to take off the bandage and break up. But how? Last time I tried to break up, he looked up at me and said, would you like me to be kinder? I broke down crying because the look in his eyes reminded me of a child begging his mother not to leave. I want him to be happy.


so here's my story. God, it feels really good to get it all out. I probably haven't done a decent job of explaining my problem clearly, but thank you for reading this, internet stranger :) 


---   
**tl;dr**: sub in D/s relationship where Dom is allowed to sleep with other women. Agreed to this arrangement because it turns me on, but it is beginning to cause pain. Unable to leave despite this and other issues because I can't bear the thought of hurting him.

Hello r/relationships... I'm the wife in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1o55sp/i_34_m_broke_my_arm_and_i_think_my_wife_32_f/). You all gave him a lot of good advise, and new perspectives there. Maybe that could be continued, with more pieces of the picture in place? 

I am not going to correct much of what he said in order to (I assume) preserve privacy, as most of those things are irrelevant. I feel no need to defend myself, or set records straight... but so many commenters expressed a desire to know more, or felt as if there was something missing. I feel like better perspectives could be offered with a few details corrected, and a few more added. 

First, I have been behaving horribly. I have been yelling, crying, and I  did kick the back door and bang my hand on the table. I have been saying cruel things, and generally being awful for the last few days. 

I am glad my husband reached out to reddit. He didn't think that the original thread would be popular, or that I would read it. He also assumed that he had altered things enough that if I did read it, then I would at most think 'wow lots of people breaking arms these days' or something similar. I did see it, and immediately recognized it was him/us. (we're both long-time redditors... ) I talked with him already as well, I'm not at all upset or anything about him posting (again, I am glad he reached out). 

So, things that I feel need to be corrected : 

- The brother actually lives with us, not down the street. This is important because he works a *LOT* (70 hours per week or so?), and often odd hours, and so he cannot help with things around the house most of the time. This includes his own stuff (laundry, dishes, etc). This is fine with me, he financially contributes quite a lot, and he does do what he can around the house. 

- I have a teenaged child (who also lives with us 100% of the time) as well. This child is a good kid, but is 15. Also, suffers from depression and anxiety (therapy twice per week, failed their grade last year due to mental health issues). They are doing *very* well right now, but do require quite a lot of support to keep up the fantastic job they are doing this year. 

- The 10 year old has special needs. I don't want to get into details, but he requires a lot of support as well (he has various therapies *eight* times per week, cannot participate in regular public school so is cyber schooled at home, needs a lot of attention, has only been fully bathrooming on his own for about a year, etc). 

- The baby is great! The best happiest baby ever. Unfortunately, she aspirates her food/drink... which means she cannot eat solid foods yet, wakes up several times per night, needs close supervision, and also gets feeding therapy and OT weekly. 

- I have an autoimmune disease. I am in pain literally all the time. My joints are swollen and stiff, to the point of being unable to close my hands some days. I have a *lot* of allergies (to medications, foods, anything you can think of) due to the autoimmune disfunction, and thus far have been unable to take meds to alleviate the symptoms due to having anaphylactic reactions to the meds we've tried. I am also utterly exhausted, all the time. I am sick constantly (I get every little cold, and wind up in the hospital with infections regularly), and we have to be *extremely* careful about my exposure to pathogens (thus limiting the amount of support from friends and such we can have). 

- I almost died in childbirth with the baby. I hemorrhaged twice, and then had an allergic reaction to the blood transfusion. I have only recently (the last few months) stopped completely falling unconscious several time per week when standing. I have fallen down the stairs due to dizziness countless times, broke my own foot a few months ago falling. I am still *severely* anemic due to the blood loss suffered during childbirth. (my iron was at a 3 when I was released from the hospital, two weeks ago it's still only at 7 in spite of treatment and excellent diet)

- My husband actually broke his hand punching an object when he was angry with me. I think this is important to mention because I am somewhat angry and feel some resentment over this... which I did not admit to myself until reading the comments in the thread he posted. 

- He initially quit his job to stay home in order to help care for me and the baby after childbirth, due to the aforementioned autoimmune disease combined with the severe blood loss and after effects. I have gotten much better over the last few months, and was seeing the sunrise (finally!) when he broke his hand. 

- My husband also suffers from severe migraines, which are debilitating a couple of times per month. He also has a sleep disorder which often (but not always) prevents him from being able to help with overnight childcare. (this means that in the baby's *entire* life, I have not *one* night slept for more than 6 hours, and that is interrupted sleep) 

My husband is a great person. He is clever, witty, charming, attractive. He's smart, he's usually an excellent problem solver, he is tenacious. I love him dearly. We've been through a very, very, very rough few years together. He is always willing to help, and do what he can, when I can clearly communicate to him what I want and need. He's an attentive, loving father, and again always willing to do whatever he needs to do. 

Myself, I am overwhelmed. The nature of the break means that he cannot do dishes, change diapers, cook, move around a lot, and he is in a lot of pain most of the time. My behaviour is utterly unacceptable. I, again, have been behaving awfully for the past few days. I am struggling with seeing hope, with seeing that there is a 'way out', that this is temporary. 

I had been going to therapy for a little while, but then when school started again I just no longer have the time to go anymore. Also, we have a manual transmission car, and my husband broke his shifting hand (I am not allowed to drive, due to medical restrictions. If I can go for a whole year without a seizure, then I can have my license again. Fingers crossed for no seizures, Feb will be the one year mark), so getting anywhere (grocery stores, therapy appointments, therapy for me) is difficult right now. 

So. What do you think? How do I chill the fuck out, stop yelling at everyone all the time, and recognize in the moment (when I am feeling overwhelmed and hopeless) that it's only a few months of life here, then we'll get back on track, and get back to where we were before? (I realize a lot of what I am feeling right now is just that two steps forward and then one step back thing) How do I accept the help I have, while feeling like a complete failure as a wife and mother? (after all, I *should* be able to do all the cooking, cleaning, and childcare! loads of other people do it!) How do I combat all the things I am feeling, reduce my stress level internally, and get the things done I need to get done? 

I recognize my need to process through and unpack my stupid feelings of resentment over how he broke his hand... he didn't mean to break it, obviously, and he feels really dumb and awful over it already (without me adding to it, which is why I have not said anything to him up until today about it). I know I need to somehow find peace, be mindful, and focus on hope and positivity. Any tips on *how* to do those things? 

And honestly very most importantly... how do I show my husband that I love him, he is wonderful, and I absolutely do not hate him?

166170,Breakups,2wwaiv,"We met in our university class. From the day we met, the chemistry and connection was instantaneous. We talked for two hours the first day after class. We went on several amazing dates, got physical (but no sex), talked on the phone for hours on end, and hung out every week after class. I was head over heels for him, and he acted like he felt the same way.

Then, after a month and a half or so, his texts dropped off, and the phone calls stopped...finally I didn't hear from him for almost a week. We met up after class and he said he felt like we were moving too fast. He said he didn't want a girlfriend. I respected that and said we could try being friends.

Three days later (this morning), he calls me and blurts out that he's been seeing someone else. They met and started talking around the time his texts slowed, and they just started hanging out this past weekend. I guess after they hung out, he made up his mind that he wanted to pursue her instead.

He didn't explain why and I probably don't want to know. He indicated though that the deciding factors were distance and age. She's closer to his age and lives in his neighborhood, whereas I live about half an hour away. He said things with her are just ""easier."" I told him that sounded like a cop-out and he said it was, so I know there's more to the story, but I don't want an itemized list of why she's better. He said, ""If you were older and lived closer, I might've been calling her to end things instead."" They're not official yet - they only started hanging out this weekend, so maybe things won't even work out. I hope they do though. I want him to be happy.

I just don't get it. Everything was perfect - all of our views were in line, we made each other laugh, we could talk for hours on end, and we were very physically attracted to each other. If he had never met her, I know we would have started a relationship. I don't get what she has that I don't. He said we're very similar though. He kept saying, ""Whatever you felt between us, I felt it too,"" but that can't be true or things wouldn't be ending. I really thought I'd met the man I would spend the rest of my life with. I know it's my fault for getting so invested and attached so soon, but I thought he felt the same way.

This fucking hurts. I know we didn't date and break up, which might've been worse, but I didn't even get a chance. I've never clicked with someone like him before - I've never met someone I felt so comfortable with, or could talk so easily with. Fuck. He kept saying I was amazing and wonderful and would meet the right guy some day. I thought that was him.

I know I do.  I have been cheated on in the past (a couple times) and it's one of my biggest fears (i'm fucked).

a few months ago my gf had a friend who lives out of the country over one night when he was back for a visit to hang out for an hour or so; it was purely plutonic.  

I have expressed to her in the past that I get uncomfortable in those situations where she has a male friend over at her house...I've explained the situation to her and she said she understood.  Well she said she wasn't going to have him over.  

I had a weird feeling all week and had asked her again during the week if she did in fact have him over or not.  She said she did not and that she would never in any way lie to me about something like that, and a lot of other stuff that she loves me and all. Well one night (and do keep in mind I had never ever in the past with this girlfriend FELT the need to be invasive of her privacy) I go through her phone and she had some texts from her male friend and the last one was ""k by there soon :)"".  So naturally I got curious and checked....she did have him over.

I confronted her the next day and basically we almost broke up but I do in fact love her a lot so I decided that because it wasn't something like cheating I could hopefully try and look past it.

Now as time goes by we have little arguments because, I don't know, I'm fucked up and keep pressing her about if she's lying to me about this and that and it basically created a lot of arguments.  if she didn't want to hang that day, I would always question it. 

(ps. she would always come here as I'm in between cars right now and she would borrow a car from a family member, granted she had permission, which, some nights she did not.  I'd see her maybe 2-4 nights a week for a couple hours, if that, at a time.  She'd sleep over usually on Fridays).  

I essentially had a fear that she had fallen out of love with me and the inevitable was coming; she was going to cheat on me.

Anyways, on Saturday, we broke up because I said that I felt we were both not getting what we wanted out of this relationship.  She went home, we haven't talked since.  I feel like I have been irrational in my ways of thinking and have ruined a really good relationship.  I'm not sure what to do from this point forward, I feel like I should go and talk to her seriously for once (since we're always being silly and goofing off) and explain that it will take a bit of work from both our ends to make this work if we really want it to...on the other hand I feel like I've acted like a fool and embarrassed myself.  

I'm not too sure what to do.  Looking to you, reddit.

Our situation is that he is Japanese and I am American. We live in Japan, but we plan to move to LA because I am starting grad school. He previously lived in the U.S. for a couple of years, his English is fantastic, and he is nice enough to move for me and support my dream. I was supposed to start grad school in January of next year, and he was supposed to follow me soon after, once his visa went through.

But he just confessed to me that he thinks it's too fast for him to move. He said he wants to wait for one more year because he wants time to save money and figure out what kind of work he can do in LA. I think this is pretty reasonable and responsible of him, especially since he has a good job now and has a good chance to save.

The question is, do I stay in Japan with him and defer my enrollment to grad school for a year, or do I go ahead of him and let him join me later? On the one hand, I am very much ready to leave Japan, totally sick of my job, and eager to start pursuing psychology so I can become a counselor. On the other hand, we are getting married, so it might be good for us to live together and start our lives together now and then move together later.

We both have professional careers, and became interested in each other 1.5 years ago.  I was single at the time, she was still with a guy of 3 years, but she was very unhappy in her relationship at the time (she said not attracted to him, he forced his way into the relationship, moved in etc...).  After a month of hanging out with each other, she broke up with him and things between us actually got more physical right away.  Eventually after 2 months he moved out, and we continued our relationship and she agreed to call it a ""relationship"" about 6 months later.

90% of the time, our relationship was AMAZING, and we had a TON of fun together.  We travelled LOTS, and had a really romantic time.  We had countless common interests and a similar sense of humour.  I would love to have a lifetime of fun like that, and was very serious about her.  However 10% of the time every several months we had these ""fights"".  

Here is an example of a typical ""fight"":
&gt;We are playing a board game at a friend's place.  She did something that is clearly against the rules.  I called her out on it and just said ""Sorry, you can't do that, it's against the rules"".  She all of the sudden got really cold with me for several days.  It was clear something went wrong that night, but she wouldn't say a word about it (it was crazy to me that it would be this little thing).  

&gt;After a week or being cold and sometimes no contact with each other, she would meet with me and say vague things like ""this is now how I expected our relationship to be"", ""we don't connect together"", ""You don't listen, and never do anything nice for me"", etc...  I press her to give me specific examples, and she uses an example of me ""rudely"" calling her out that night when everyone let it slide, but says ""this is one example, I am just unhappy"".  

&gt;I spend hours apologizing, explaining how much I care for her, and showing in great detail all the nice and romantic things I've done for her, and all the fun we had together.  She wouldn't accept it and leave.  The next day we meet again, and she pretty much says ""what should we do?"" putting me on the spot to make a decision, I always say we had a lot of fun, and we should try to work on it, and try to come up with things to work on (i.e. ""being more open"" etc..).  After another week of ""awkwardness"", relationship goes back to our normal fantastic time!

This happens roughly every 2 months.  

Recently, I was working on a very important project for work and asked her for her feedback.  She was very rude in her feedback and I said ""you know how we said we would be open about things that bug us.  It would be great if you can give me feedback in a nicer way for example...""... and she got angry, yelled at me for being so sensitive, and stormed out, leading to the usual ""fight"". 

I was stressed out about my job, and feeling very crappy.  Instead of ""trying to win her back"", I said ""you know what, you are right, this isn't working out"", and we broke up.  I feel terrible about it; I feel like I lost my other half.  I miss all the fun, exciting, and romantic times together, and constantly feel like it's all my fault.  I feel like I tried to be the best man for her, but could have done better. :(



Here are some things I found ""weird"" about our relationship:

* Right when we started dating, she still had photos of her and her ex everywhere.  She removed them 3 months into dating, and never put up picture of us.  He moved to another country, but she still says she misses him.
* She would never confess her affection to me.  I would always say how much I care for her, and she would never return it.  Even though from our romantic moments it's obvious she cares for me.  I thought maybe it's just her personality.
* She kept me ""secret"" and never told her friends b/c she didn't want them to know that she is seeing someone while living with her ex.  Took 6 months before she finally told people
* She has never apologized to me for anything (objectively).  I feel like she isn't that type of person.
* When she fixes her opinion on something, it's IMPOSSIBLE to change her mind.  She is very smart and usually I agree with her, but the times we don't.. leading to another typical ""fight"".
* She continued to get text messages from other ""guys"" who were interested in her at some point, and kept showing me their messages and asking me ""what should I tell them? etc.."". 

I can say way more positive things: smart, funny, sarcastic, adventurous, caring (except during fights).  


**TL;DR**

90% of the most fantastic, romantic, amazing time a couple can have.

10% (after some isolated incident of disagreement) - not talking, telling me she isn't happy and has not been happy the entire time, and putting me on the spot to try to win her back, etc... 
I did that for 1 year, and eventually, combined with job stress, did not do my usual ""try to win her back"".  And we broke up.

Is this normal in relationships? Is it normal for a woman to react this way to these things?  Is it a sign that things aren't working out?

Does that sound like a healthy relationship to you?

167289,Breakups,2hahnm,"We have been dating for almost half a year and everything seemed fine.  We usually see each other a few times a week and she stays over at my place often.  

2 Mondays ago, she was staying at my place, we had sex, and she cuddled with me all night.  Tuesday morning we went to have breakfast at her favorite place before I had to go to work and she was more quiet than normal.  She said she was just tired, but she seemed okay, I dropped her off at her place, and gave each other a goodbye kiss.

Thursday was the next time I was able to see her since she has her own things on Tuesday/Wednesday to do.  I picked her up and we went out to eat and shared our food together.  Conversation was normal we talked about our days and the normal random stuff.  I suggested we go get ice cream and she wanted to get ice cream at this place a few blocks away.  We were walking over there (she loves to walk to places) holding hands and my arm was around her to warm her up.  Out of no where she just states that this relationship isn't going to work.  I'm super confused because just a few nights ago she was cuddled up next to me and now all of a sudden she's just breaking up with me.

She wasn't seeing another guy when she broke up with me.  She's currently trying to date again.  We met on OkCupid and she's reactivated her profile on there (as have I.)  I'm more or less just confused on what the fuck happened to make a woman suddenly decide that she doesn't want to see a guy anymore when she was just cuddling with him a few nights before.  Most of the women I have dated usually know within a month whether the guy is worth continuing a relationship with, but after 5 months and no fight to lead up, it's really confusing to me.

Looking for any opinions on what the problem could have been.  I'm guessing she just wants to date around more and doesn't see me as her future husband (which is what she's looking for according to her.)  All the women I'm friends with say to ignore her and let her make the attempt to restart it.

124693,Dating,2t8vfv,"So this is a long story. Let's call her Amy...

If there's any grammar mistake, please tell me, English is not my native language.

So me and Amy met each other at the daycare, and for some reason our moms became friends. Naturally, we both grew together and from that friendship of our mothers, our friendship was born, and she quickly became my best friend.

At some point of our childhood, her family moved to a nearby city, not allowing us to see each other all the time. Even though our families kept meeting every month, our main source of communication was the phone, and it was until recently the internet replaced it.

When I got older, around 11 years old, I started looking her with a different way, I started thinking how nice she was and how good I felt around her. But at that age, I really didn't know what I wanted, I was too young to actually consider anything, so I ended forgetting all about that.

Two years passed. I found myself a little depressed from a previous dating attempt that went wrong, and at that time we texted a lot, and that brought me that feeling again, that she was special.

It was too late for me however: she was dating someone else, a boy she met at her school. I had to force myself to forget and once again, I lost that feeling.

They broke up in the end of that year, and I was single, and once again that feeling came back. That unresolved thing. So I invited her to watch a movie, I would try to say something at least.
That attempt didn't worked well, mostly for her family having other plans on the day. So an opportunity passed.

Amy started dating again, and I was frustated. I lost my chance and she was happy like I've never seen her. I forgot, again and again.

Three years passed. I finally moved on and I was dating a girl from my high school. I was happy, I knew what college I wanted, I had a lot of friends and finally my first girlfriend.

We broke in that same year, and I didn't wanted anyone for some time, just wanted to live my single life until I went to college.

So in the last year I went to college, and so did Amy. My college is at the same town I've always lived, while hers is really far away. I've seen a lot of posts on Facebook of her new live and she seemed too different from the girl I liked. So I was sure I really did move on and was not falling in love again. By this point we didn't talked that much like we did before.

That was my certainty, until this past weekend, when we managed to meet up. She didn't changed, she was the same she always was. We once started texting non-stop again, and now we tease each other, a thing we never did before. 

Now I ask myself: What should I do? Should I go for it, say something and risk this friendship of 15 years? Should I carefully keep teasing until something happen? Should I forget about it once again and try to move on?

I'm afraid that maybe its just me again, stepping on the same trap, and trying something that maybe is not meant to happen.

I've heard from mutual friends, and even from her mother, that she already thought about me like that, but she was afraid to risk the friendship. That was before college, and the nice talks, and the teasing, so I wonder myself all those questions.

I'm new to relationships, only had one girlfriend, and it didn't last long.

The trouble with us right now is that among his belittling behavior, the worst is the way he talks behind my back, due to the way the words linger. When he isn't angry with me, he tells me everyone likes me and says nice things about me. When he's angry, and trying to put me down, he tells me no one likes you because XYZ, My friends think I should leave you, Everyone says I'm a great guy and you're lucky to have me.

372,Relationships,369q0u,"My girlfriend of 2 years who I love dearly was recently diagnosed with complex PTSD or C-PTSD, which some people call the worst form of PTSD. I took a course on mental health/etc before and I asked her to see her doctor because of some of the symptoms she was showing and he diagnosed her with C-PTSD (she is also seeing a therapist now). It's really hard on our relationship but I love her dearly and want to make it work, but I haven't been truly happy in a while. First, let me tell you the story:


My girlfriend grew up mostly with her mother &amp; stepdad in a house with many siblings, 2 biological, 3 step siblings, and many foster siblings (her mother uses the foster kids as income, it's horrible). The biological &amp; step kids were neglected for the foster kids since the parents needed the income from housing them (that's how the system works around here -.-). My gf was put in grown-up positions too early like doing all the housework, babysitting instead of having time with friends or to do homework, etc. 


She started dating this guy when she was 14, partly for attention from her mother who was hugely against it. Btw she already had mild anxiety at this point. Then a year later he rapes her, tells her that if she tells anyone he'll ruin her life, and becomes really controlling and she stays with him for years. He raped/hit/verbally abused her regularly for years and her mother just called her a hormonal bitch when she was acting up, but in reality she was depressed/anxious and having suicidal thoughts.


He eventually cheated on her and dumped her. A while later I met her and eventually we started dating seriously and she told me what had happened to her. We live together now and we both work full-time. 


Her doctor sent her to the best PTSD counsellor in our area and she said she could tell almost right away after a brief chat (without my gf even telling her what happened, because that might trigger her) that her ptsd was severe. I looked up the symptoms myself too and she has pretty much all of them: inability to trust anyone, flashbacks, nightmares, constant racing thoughts, depression, anxiety, jumpiness, trouble sitting still, extreme mood swings and bursts of anger, violence (she has hit me during her triggers when she has a flashback and thinks I am her ex), low self-esteem, fear of sexuality, trouble paying attention, fear of crowds/people, and also she is very intelligent and is quite a linguist but has trouble reading now since her mind literally can't focus long enough on the words on the page. She doesn't want to take any meds, which I can understand in some cases since North America is definitely over-medicated imo but I think meds might help her a bit. 


Also another symptom is trouble maintaining friendships/relationships/family ties because she is afraid of being hurt and also has severe mood swings. As a result she doesn't really have any close friends so we tend to stay at home together but that also means I don't get to see my friends either and I'm afraid I will lose them soon. She has also become controlling. She doesn't want me on Facebook/text unless she's there with me, won't let me hang out with friends by myself, and she can't be left home alone for long because if she has a trigger there is nothing to take her mind off it and she will blow up on me when I get home. Also I can't watch TV with females in the show/movie because she will think I'm checking them out. I have to look away both on TV and in real life and I disagree with this but she rages if I bring it up. 


I know it sounds crazy but even though she calls me names/yells/sometimes hits me when she has a trigger, if any of you know someone who has ptsd or have ever seen a trigger then you might know that they don't mean to intentionally hurt people. She is COMPLETELY different when it acts up.


There is so much more I could write but it's already really long and rant-y, but basically I love her and care about her but both our lives are kind of hell-ish a lot of the time. She really is a sweet girl when she's having a good day; she's thoughtful, kind, honest, smart, funny, loves animals, works hard. She always apologizes when she calls me names/hits me. I have a lot of anger toward her ex because he basically ruined her life forever and got away with it. Is it unfair to not be with someone because of their mental illness? What can I do? :(

This is where it gets tricky.  The only requirement I really want for a wedding is for it to be a destination wedding.

At least this way everyone who attends gets their own little vacation and everything for the wedding is in a nice package, easy planning right?

- Her family members and friends cannot afford to spend anything over $1100.  Despite the fact that they all have brand new cars and each take a vacation trip to a similar destination each year.

My GF and I attended one of her friends destination weddings last year where we both spent $1700 and I had a blast.  I think its a little ironic that I can spend $1700 on people I dont even know.

I wanted to get married next march as this would give everyone more advanced notice to save and book vacation time etc.  Apparently this is unacceptable as the costs in March are $1400 but I digress.





Now that we are on a rushed timeline my GF has stated she is depressed and sad.  She has said things to me about wishing I had never proposed and that her life is soo much more stressful.  Even though most of the stress is due to her choices and trying to appease everybody except for me.  These statements are pretty hurtful to me given I spent thousands of dollars on an engagement ring, and being married is something she wanted.


As separate issues it seems my GF is prioritizing everyone's needs ahead of my own and all these items cause arguments when I am finally off work and just want to relax.





- Her grandmother has health issues and dementia so her travelling is out of the question, so now we must have a separate ceremony where she can attend,for $2000

- One of her bridesmaids is a nurse and can't get vacation times so we have to consider her schedule when planning the wedding

- Another of her bridesmaids has another wedding to attend in October so I must now consider that.




To be honest the whole wedding idea has put me off.  I am supposed to be a walking wallet and bend to my GF's every demand because It's her day, and none of my concerns are considered. I also am starting to resent her family for having an influence on her so heavily for our plans.  They had 25 years to save cash for her wedding if they wanted a say in the proceedings. 


For example we had a discussion about my concerns about bridesmaids, she wants 4 which is fine we had a discussion about me not being able to find 4 groomsmen as most of my friends are from my athletic teams and we are not close enough to have that kind of relationship.  Instead of listening to my concerns she went ahead and notified all the bridesmaids, so I guess we are having 4.  No big deal but all these little items keep boiling over.  I've basically told her that if she won't listen to my opinions on these things so we decide together she can just go ahead and do it all.  At least that way I can relax on my downtime, but I'm still bring accosted with little issues everytime I get off work that I could just care less about.  I just want it to be booked and done with.

76337,Relationships,2vcrwk,"Things are going well with us now, but last summer my girlfriend almost broke up with me. During that time I wasn't very sure if I wanted to be in a relationship, and I was stressed about life, and I think we just kind of stagnated. I did not want to break up, however. 

She came over to my place on a couple of occasions this summer and said she wasn't happy. The second time she did, I told her that things would change for the better. Later I asked her why she didn't actually break up with me at that time, and she said it was really just a matter of inconvenient timing. I never really understood that.

In October I fell in love with her again. It was our 2 year anniversary and we took a weekend trip to celebrate. We hadn't taken a trip together in a long time. From that point on I have seen her has my ideal mate and I have been putting more effort into the relationship. She has said that its like shes dating a different person. 

It took me a long time to realize why I snooped in the first place. I knew it wasn't because I didn't trust her. Eventually, I realized that I snooped because I wanted some emotional context for what was going on this summer. I didn't want to bring up the bad times with her because I knew that would lead nowhere. I didn't trust myself or the relationship enough to test it by talking in depth about what was going on this summer.

I didn't expect to find anything that would bother me. I just thought it would be some insight into what was going on this summer, like where she was emotionally, or anything specific that I did or didn't do that had made her want to break up.

I found that she had essentially written off our relationship, even referring to it in the past tense at one point. I also found that she was thinking often about this guy that she met 10 years prior. 

She wanted to start a relationship with him, and see how their personalities match. She said she wanted to hear his voice on the phone at night. He lives on the other side of the U.S. It seems he has always been physically distant from her. They have never lived in the same state, or even the same part of the country. They met at a camp during high school, and kept in touch during college. They met again at least once during a conference during college, where she cheated on her college boyfriend with him.

So she contacted him via Facebook in July, they exchanged a few platonic messages, and then he didn't reply to her last one. She was generally not happy with the way the exchange went, and she said something about how he probably is not interested.

I feel like she should know what I did. Even though I'm bothered by her having thoughts about this guy, I can put it into the context of the time. She was not happy and she had written us off.

If I confess, my fear is that she will at least not trust me for a period of time, or at worst break up with me. That is why I haven't told her about it yet. But its always in the back of my mind. I want her to know is that I did it, I haven't done it since, and I will never do it again. 

If I didn't find anything that bothered me, I wouldn't feel the need to confess. But now I have this illicit information, and I want her to know that I know and that she doesn't owe me any explanation, that I understand why she was thinking about this guy, that I trust her, and that I will never do it again. Or maybe that would be a bad idea, I don't know.

76044,Dating,273rm7,"To make things easier, we'll refer to my friend as Carly. And I apologize if this is a little scattered- I'm writing this at 4 in the morning, after lying awake thinking about this all night.

Carly and I have known eachother for almost all of our lives- living just six doors away from eachother and attended all of the same schools.

As far as I know, Carly has been interested in a relationship with me for a good deal of that time. I remember being in elementary school and being told that she had a crush on me that perpetuated into middle school, and during either my sophomore or junior year of high school, she texted my brother one night to have him tell me that she was once again (or was still) interested in me.

Whenever she would tell me she was interested, it was always through someone else. This allowed me to behave as if I never heard it, and when I would see her again I would just act as if nothing had changed.

In elementary, I wasn't really interested in relationships yet. In middle school, I dated a different girl for about three months of 7th grade, but never really thought abut Carly that way. In high school, I began to debate with myself about whether or not I wanted to actually try something with her. I never told anyone, and never acted on it. 

In high school, I was going through a lot of stuff. Depression, anxiety attacks, realizing my parents are emotionally abusive, and fighting just to keep passing grades are just a few of these issues. I felt that I was *not* in a place to date anyone during high school. I felt insane and insufferable. 

To get to the point- I want to talk to her sometime before I leave to explain this to her. I feel like ignoring her feelings all those times was cruel of me, and at the very least I want to apologize for that. 

The things that I'm worried about are: What if I come off like I want to start a relationship now? I'm still not sure if I want to, or if she's even interested anymore. Plus, I'm leaving for the Navy sometime soon (haven't gotten a date yet) and I'll be gone for four years. Also, a few of our mutual male friends have asked her out before, (she denied all of them) and she was kinda stressed out about them for a little while. After each one, she was really conscious of things they did around her and how she behaved around them to avoid leading them on. (Edit: We are, however, still friends with these guys. Usually after a month or two everyone involved calms down and things return to normal.)

Another thing that's on my mind: There was another girl that I was kinda friends with- we'll call her Melissa. She was interested in me for a few years of high school as well, and like with Carly, I just ignored her feelings. Melissa fell into a pretty intense depression and eventually decided that because guys were never interested in her, she would instead date girls. To this day, Melissa has only dated girls and is a bit hesitant when it comes to guys. The reason I bring this up is because it's evidence that what I've done definitely has the ability to hurt. I feel pretty bad about what I did to Melissa, and I think that if I just had at least addressed her feelings, she wouldn't have gone through such a scarring experience. (Not calling her choice to become a lesbian scarring. I am calling her depression and weird feelings towards guys scarring, because that's how she describes it.)

I'm afraid of how I may have hurt Carly. She is my best friend, and it bothers me that I was such an ass for pretty much our entire lives when it came to her feelings toward me. It hasn't been brought up in a long while, so I kinda feel like digging up the past may do more bad than good, but too I feel like resolving something she never got the answer to would be nice for her, and me too I guess. 

So what do you think /r/relationships? Should I explain my past behavior to Carly and make sure there aren't any hurt feelings? Or should I just carry on and let it lie like I always have?

**TL;DR I have ignored my best friend's romantic feelings for me for years, and I feel like I should talk to her about it.**

Edit: (copy/paste from one of my comments) Another detail I just remembered: She hasn't dated anyone since she told me she was interested in me again in middle school. Some of my friends who know about this have speculated that maybe she's been keeping herself available for me... And hearing about her turning down yet another guy last week has gotten me thinking maybe it's true? I don't want to believe it is, because if it is then I will feel absolutely TERRIBLE for ignoring her all this time. And the possibility of this being true also kinda makes me want to talk to her about it more so she isn't saving herself for me when I'm gone.

(Throwaway because he is also a Redditor)

First off, I am very recently divorced (less than a month) and he is a coursemate in my grad program. We have the same specialization and have grown close over the past 2 months (known each other for 6 months). I swear, you could cut and serve the sexual tension between us on a platter and it would cure sexual dysfunction! 

At the end of last week I went over to his place to make dinner and watch TV. It became a little chilly. He brings out a blanket and we snuggle in to it together. Sparks. Oh the sparks! We had our first kiss, and I have to be honest, I have never had anyone get in my head like that after just one kiss. We stopped, and just snuggled against each other for the rest of the time. 

I left to go home after that (we both had early morning seminars) and I could barely focus the next day. Last night I made dinner and we watched TV, and we went to 3rd base. Damn, I don't think I can push him away anymore!

He comes from a very different background (grew up around mountains, happy family) compared to mine (grew up in the city, bullied for being fat; regained some confidence after losing 50lbs, eldest child in a very messy divorced family). Personality-wise, we're perfectly compatible. But he has been hurt before, as have I. We both want to take it slow (for professional reasons) but he is very hesitant to define what we are. 

Colleagues during the day, lovers at night? 

I want to respect what we have, and we have a lot of respect and trust of each other. I don't want to damage this, because he is the first man I have taken any sort of interest in for a long time. I also want to make sure this is not a ""rebound"" relationship for either of us. 

My question is, how should I approach this without rushing in to things, while respecting his own insecurities and time to heal? I feel this is something special, and I don't want to cock it up. At the same time, there is still a lot of that we need to learn about each other, and I don't want to appear pushy or clingy.

I feel a lot of anger towards my parents and a lot of anger that i got pregnant when i was using bc and that i had to have an abortion and it really gets me down. for about the first two weeks my bf was really supportive.

I tried to return the favor by making dinner for when he gets home from work or dressing up and trying to be romantic and whatnot.

We were having a good time watching movies when me bf who was still at work asked me if when he got home we could go out. I told him that he was fine to go out with our friend but i was going to stay home- it had been a really hard day for me. he instead texted the friend about a rocky horror picture show thing and then peer pressured me into going. He literally put me in the position where i would have looked really bad saying no because he had friends from out of town that were coming and he had told them id go and whatnot. I have felt really dirty recently. I have a lot of sexual background stuff that makes me feel disgusting sometimes and that day i could not handle it. I cried during half the show. When i got home i cried for a good three hours. When i told my bf how it had made me felt he told me that our friend that had been over was sad about his cat and he had to cheer him up. I get upset because he has no regards for how i feel. I couldve stayed home and things wouldve been fine. After that night he began closing up to me.

First the backstory. I dated my ex for about 2 years but we broke up when I discovered that she cheated multiple times AND had unprotected sex. I immediately got tested and came out clean, but I know there is no current test for HPV in men. Which leads to the real problem.

I have been dating my current girlfriend for 10 months (I met her about 3 months after my breakup) and I've never been happier. She is truly the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. This morning however, I discovered after shaving down south what I *think* to be genital warts. It's honestly tough to tell because of how subtle they are and if they're just freckles or not.

67353,Relationships,1vbn8t,"I had a wonderful 9 month relationship with this girl that ended about a year ago. We met through work and hit it off amazingly. Due to her situation, things became incredibly rushed and she was living with me after about 3 months of seeing each other (it was either she stay with me or move 5 states away, and she choose to stay with me). Things were rough at first but after a few weeks everything leveled out and turned into the best relationship I've ever had.  
  
Eventually things became very stressful again when we both transitioned through multiple jobs and had to find another place to rent. We were both on edge and not handling it well. Once we got settled in our new place things got a little better but weren't quite the same. We fought a lot, I tried to break up with her and took it back, she eventually put the final nail in the coffin and ended things with me. I was so stressed with the situation (higher rent, new job, less pay, and constantly being an ass because of this) that I just let her go. I said things to her like oh well, it's happened before and I guess it was bound to happen again (break ups) and was just a real ass about it in general.   
  
We remained friends through all of this and our relationship as friends was back to how we were at the peak of our romantic relationship (just without the sex or a lot of the emotional responsibilities). This went on for almost a year. I got a girlfriend, she got a boyfriend or two, but we remained great friends and saw each other regularly. I recently joined her downtown to celebrate her birthday and she got pretty trashed. She has a habit of losing her valuable stuff and getting into awkward situations, so I followed her around doing damage control for most of the night. As the night went on she got more and more physical with me and eventually just flat out kissed me. This went on until we were alone waiting for our ride to take us back so we could crash and she admitted that she fucked up and wished things could have been different. I told her that I felt the same way and I regret letting her go so easily (not to mention being a huge jerk about the whole thing).   
  
We made up, and I told her I'd like to start again but she just got out of a relationship and just wants to do her own thing for a while.   
**Here's where I get confused**  
I understand that she doesn't want to rush into another relationship, and that she needs time to herself. I'm not quite sure what to do about our feelings until she decides she wants to be in a relationship again.   
I don't want to rush things, I know that's what ultimately ended our previous relationship and I **really** want things to be different this time because I care about this girl more than I've cared about any other girl. I guess I'm just having trouble managing my own feelings now that I know exactly how she feels. I don't want to smother her, but there's obviously something between us that's been lying in wait for almost a year now.   
  
  
  
**tl;dr**: Great relationship ends due to stress and frustration. A year later ex admits feelings she still has and regrets over breaking up, but doesn't want relationship right now.   
  
  
  
  
  
**Update**: I went out to a bar we frequent last night to hang out with her and our mutual friend. The friend was really excited at the idea of us getting back together and was a total bro about the situation. After he convinced me to talk to her about what happened the other night I worked up the courage and asked if we could talk. She initially said no, but we eventually found ourselves alone outside and it happened anyway.   
  
At first she started up with the same old I just want to do me stuff, but after pushing her for an answer about how she really feels (and the possibility of us ever happening again) She told me how she really felt.   
  
Just a little back story: A month after the breakup I realized what I'd done by letting her go and I tried to make up and get her back. She turned me down and said I should have done that when she broke things off. There was also something she said I did that she couldn't get over, and every time I asked what it was she'd say if I didn't know then she wasn't going to tell me again (I honestly had no clue).   
Last night she finally told me what it was I did. A month or so prior to our relationship's end, I started picking apart her personality and critisizing her for everything. She said after the breakup she kept having to ask her friends about herself to confirm I was wrong.   
I don't know how I could be so one-sided during this breakup that I didn't realize that I was emotionally damaging her so badly. I've realized I can have somewhat of a know-it-all personality, is it possible that I repressed something like that so recently because I didn't want to admit to myself what I'd done? Idk, either way she said that she'd forgiven me so that we could be friends again, but she could never get past what I did to her and because of that, she could never date me again...  
  
I'm pretty torn up about it, I didn't realize I was capable of something like that. It's like something you hear about from other shitty relationships and think to yourself Wow, I'm glad I'm not like that! but apparently I am (or at least was). 

Anyway, thanks for the replies. Now I've just got to work on forgiving myself and moving on.

I know this is a stupid question and no-one can answer it for me, and I can't even answer it within myself, but should I be feeling this warm crazy rush as opposed to a calm fondness?

For the past 2 years I let Yoda on the bed. But now, I really don't think I can go back to sleeping on the bed now that I remember how great a good night's sleep is. What should I say to my fiance this afternoon? Am I being selfish wanting to sleep without Yoda with us?

TL;DR I don't sleep well with our dog Yoda on the bed but my fiance wants him to be able to. I slept on the couch and nows she's upset. What should I do?

UPDATE : She agreed to have Yoda not sleep in the bedroom. Though I agreed that as a reward we will let him sleep in the bed some weekends. Sorry for not updating you guys right away, as I've been very busy lately.

186955,Breakups,1m6zs0,"I [22/m] recently moved back home with my Mother to help her recover from bladder cancer surgery. Since being home I cannot stop thinking about my high school lover [Now 20/f]. 


I don't love her or hate her, because I don't even know her anymore. It's been 4 years since I've spoken to her, and I only know some of the bigger things in her life that I've heard from friends and seen on Facebook. I can't stop thinking about her and whether I should try and contact her. Heres the story of our relationship.

Fall Junior Year I [16] meet her [14 Freshman]. I randomaly just went up and introduced myself to her and her friends. I don't know why I did it, because I'm normally shy, but afterwards we couldn't stay apart and started dating a few weeks after. We lost our virginity together that winter. 

Come the summer time I [17] had a very busy couple months planned. Figuring it would be easy since it was just high school and didn't know any better, and I broke up with her [16]. I will later come to find out it hit her very hard and she made a terrible mistake sleeping with a good friend out of loneliness.

Fall Senior Year I [17] have a car and a job now. On mypsace one night she [15] is having a slumber party with a bunce of friends (2 guys 2 girls total). They are playing around on a webcam and I start messing with them. We start talking a lot and she looks happy to see me. In the morning I go over to the house and the attraction is undeniable as we are wrestling all over the place. 

A week or so goes by and we keep talking about what happened and what she went through. She's scarid because she was hurt bad. At a football game that week a friend of her ""A"" asks her out and she says yes. Later that evening we are hanging out and I express wanting to get back together and promise I wont hurt her. She says ok, and breaks up with ""A"" (He is important later)

Everything is great until late Winter early Spring. I [18] had been working a lot and been playing a lot of World of Warcraft. She [16] was rightfully feeling neglected. She wrote me a note in school saying we needed to talk. I paniced and broke up with her at lunch. I knew I was so wrong that night. 

Next day I tell her I was wrong and try getting back together with her. She says she needs to think about it, because she's really upset about it. That week ""J"" asks her out and she says yes. She said it wasn't anything and would feel bad breaking up with him so quickly to go back out with me and still needed time. 

I knew he was bad for her. He was aggresive, dominating, and (I have no proof) abusive. But she wouldn't listen to me, and he kept getting aggresive with me (threats, pushing, intimidation) I stuck with it for a while figuring I would be there when she came around. That summer I stopped talking to her completely. 

Getting over her wasn't easy, but I dated other people, saw a therapist, and moved away. Eventually she was just another girl I had dated to me. I was never happy with the ending though, because I never knew if she loved me, hated me, or was indifferent. It's like reading a books ending where the main character gets shot, but it never tells you if he lived or died. 

I have a chance here to get the ending to the story, but I don't know if it's the right thing to do or how to do it. All I know about her is she dated ""J"" up until her Junior year and then dated ""A"" (yeah same guy) shortly after up until this summer. She's registered in the army so will be getting deployed at some point. 

Is contacting her a bad idea?
If not how do I do it?

**TL:DR** I have a chance to close an open book in my life with my previous high school lover, but I don't know how to do it or if it's even the right thing to do.

But until then, my stipend is only $13,000 a year, with an expectation we will NOT work during the summer, but instead take additional classes.

My father is a wealthy banker. He wants to purchase a house in the $150,000-$200,000 range that will resell for more after five years of me living in it and have me pay only ""minimal"" rent-- that way, I wouldn't have to share an apartment or live in a really bad place. It sounded like a good deal at first, but it turns out he wants me to pay the same rent I was paying while earning my master's, when my stipend was $25,000/year, or $600 month, utilities not included. So we're probably looking at $800/month just on the housing situation. 

I explained to him that was way out of my budget, that I was thankful that he was trying to help me, but there was no way I could meet that. I could swing (maybe) $300, more likely $250. 

He said that I should either take up a part time job (on top of teaching two classes for my stipend AND taking three classes AND research) or continue my ""fliipping"" business (basically, I go to thrift stores a few times a week, buy stuff and resell it online: it can bring in about $3,000/month, but is easily a 15-25 hours a week thing, and I don't see where I'm going to have that kind of time.)

When he suggested these thing I was actually really offended, because it suggests he doesn't think my PhD is ""real"" -- it's a serious commitment and the next five years of my life are going to be the most busy and difficult ever. I won't have time to work for $8/hour or spend half a day scouting up new things to sell and listing them online. 

I'm not sure what to do yet: should I say, ""Thanks, but no thanks,"" or try to make him see my perspective again? How can I even make him see it? I feel in some ways taken advantage of: he's going to use me as a steward to take care of a property he hopes to make more money on in five-six years when he resells it, but is gouging me for rent money... money that makes a HUGE difference to my quality of life but NONE to his. (At $600 month it'd be hard to afford food, spending $600 on something he needs/wants isn't a big deal to him.)

I can't even go out with friends for dinner without having her guilt trip me into staying home and being with her. She essentially has no friends outside of school and I always encourage her to make new friends and go out with them. I support her 100%. We have always talked through our problems together and I am finally at my limit. We both agree that at times she is too selfish and spoiled for me to handle. I feel as though the biggest problem is that she is an only child and has had this lifestyle her whole life and perhaps I have pampered her too much. We often get into fights now about how selfish she is. I have tried to adjust and I talk to her about what she wants from me, but she always bursts into tears. I care a lot about her, but I am afraid of asking my friends for advice because I don't want her to feel uncomfortable with the fact that our mutual friends may know. We literally tell each other everything. (TMI: We even know when the other is pooping.) What should I do? I just don't know how much longer I can take of her being selfish.

88347,Relationships,3ducnj,"We (me, 18F and BF 23M) have been in a tough spot lately. We talked about seeking help from here and he has been very supportive.

I was raised in a mindset of absolute promises. If you promise something you do anything in your power to keep it. You never promise anything you aren't 100% sure you would keep. He thinks there are promises more important than others. 

When we started dating two years ago our sex life was not that great. I had a very high libido and he was not that interested in sex. He also seemed irritated afterwards. I tried every kink and trick but to no avail. He still wasn't as interested in having sex as often as I wanted. I also felt like he wasn't trying to fix things. 

When I learned he masturbated regularly, I was very angry. There he was whacking away and not even trying to have sex with me as often as I wanted. Nowadays, I see things a little differently but those were my thoughts at the time. He told me recently that he had performance anxiety due to hyperfocusing on me ""coming"".

I asked him if he could stop masturbating and focus completely on our sex life. He agreed. Week later I found out he had masturbated. I was heartbroken. Breaking a promise is a huge thing for me. I even had a panic attack. He was very sorry and promised to not masturbate anymore. I told him to never promise stuff he wouldn't keep. He told me he understood the way I saw promises. After I calmed down I asked him if he was really Ok with it. He said he was. I told him that if he ever changed his mind we could talk about it. He told me there was no need. Our relationship blossoms. We are super happy, awesome sex life and we solve a lot of problems by being open.

Skip to April of this year. He accidentally slips that he has watched porn. I was kinda annoyed since he had had issues with ejaculating prematurely and watching porn could aggravate that. He went really defensive. When I asked he denied masturbating. While we are fighting he has another slip. I confront him and he confesses to masturbating. I am very hurt. He has been lying to my face while paying lip service to open communication. He starts blaming me for everything and deflecting( it's not masturbation if he doesn't do it to completion, it's my fault for having a migraine.) He apologizes for saying these things later in counseling. I make it clear that the main problem is his lying. 

We agree to stay together. I take some time to myself. I ask him  not to masturbate. To me it feels like opening your relationship after infidelity. We get back together. Sex starts feeling like a chore. I am constantly having migraines. I just decide to ""get over it"" and bottle everything up. We do couple stuff together and have sex regularly.

In May everything blows up. We are set to be engaged in a day and I cannot handle it anymore. I have felt incredibly bad for the last month and lost all trust in him. We agree to go to couples counseling. We decide to get engaged as a promise to try to salvage the relationship. I stop having sex with him.

Week after he gets annoyed with having no sex. He badgers me while I refuse. Eventually he tells me I promised ""I would take care of him other ways if I didn't want to have sex"". As my promises are absolute I give him a handjob. I feel shitty and break down. He breaks down too and admits I never promised such a thing. He cries and apologizes. Even thinking about touching him starts feeling absolutely repulsive. Counseling goes kinda fine. I start to understand things more and start to feel better. Counselor goes to summer vacation.

Sometimes later he asks me if I would be okay with him touching me. I ask him if he thinks it's unfair. He says it's ok. I make sure he knows I will not touch him even if he wants to touch me. He says it's ok. After he has made me orgasm he demands I finish him. I refuse. He get irritated and ""barks"" at me the rest of the evening. Later when I rise this matter up again he apologizes. 

Last week I wanted to talk about things. He din't want to at the time. Later when we talked he was constantly crying and started talking about a time he masturbated with a certain toy and he felt like shit. When I ask he tells me it was before I busted him. We check the receipt together since I was suspicious and the toy arrived in late April. After I ""busted"" him but before we stop having sex. He has a panic attack. He cannot remember if that time was after or before. He has now accepted it was after. I still don't want to divorce. He gets really sad and tells me he hates himself when I try to bring this up. He doesn't know why he did it. He says he never thinks about stuff like this before doing sexual stuff but feels bad afterwards. Eventually he caved in when I told him I want him to get individual counseling if he feels like he has no control over things like the masturbation and lying.

I am so distraught right now. I just started building back trust and he has lied me again. I actually believed him when he said that he would never have done this if he knew how much it would hurt me, but that's not true apparently. Our counseling starts in August and he has promised to seek individual counseling also. I want to make this work so bad. I just need advice on how to trust him again.

I know I told only bad things about him. He's not a bad person, honest. He loves to do stuff for me, he isn't abusive our sex life was always on both of our terms. We share similar wants for future and interests. He has been super supportive with my migraines and trauma( I see an individual counselor) and really wants to make our relationship work. We just need to fix this one problem. I just need advice on how to learn to trust him again.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend lied for two years about not masturbating and has done it again. We have gotten counseling but this has wrecked the healing process.

I'll try to put as much background in as I can before talking about the current situation. I appreciate your time.

**Background:** My girlfriend and I have been dating for just over a year. It's my first real relationship and more or less hers too. We've had some problems in the past, nothing big like infidelity or anything. More along the lines of conflicting views, big fights over little things, etc. We were both learning how to share ourselves with another person. When she is herself; she is loving, caring, passionate, and protective. I love her very much. Please do not judge her based solely on whats written here, since the focus will be on her mental illnesses. 

**Battles with mental illness:** my girlfriend has been battling depression and anxiety since high school. This summer her parents undertook a business venture that went south, she worked with them every day and it exasperated her anxiety a huge amount. After they sold the business, she began exhibiting signs of borderline personality disorder, which manifests around the 20's. Trips to psychiatrists and therapists more or less confirmed this. She has self harmed for years but at that time it got worse, and she ended up in the hospital. Since then she's gotten better with that and she hasn't done it in months. She has been taking Prozac since about October, starting low and increasing periodically. She's almost at the dose the doctors said she should be at now.

**Our relationship since:** The past half year has been really tough. The way her BPD mostly manifests itself is that she will get very offended over something harmless that I would say. At that point I am the worst person she has ever met in her life. She would insult me, attack my weaknesses, and once or twice she has hit me. She expects me to do or say very specific things. She won't ask me to do it but instead attacks me because I *haven't* yet. When I do those things afterwards, it's too late and she won't accept it. Nothing I do or say in those times will bring her out. The only thing that ever worked is me completely breaking down. Other than that, it's just time. When she is clear, she knows that this is all that works, her therapist recommends this. But when she's in that state, if I tell her that we need 5 or 10 minutes apart she attacks me for it. So usually I have to take her home and leave. An hour or two later she will text me apologizing profusely and I know she's back.

**What I've done:** I have tried to be as understanding as possible about this. I have read books and journals regarding BPD. I have had joint therapy sessions with her to try to learn skills to deal with it better. When she gets into a situation like that at home, I'm always willing to pick her up, even though she would usually transfer that over to me and I would have to take her back. I understand that when she gets like that she cannot control her actions, so I never hold things she does against her. The guilt she feels when she comes out of her episodes is immense as it is, I try not to add to it.

**Pot smoking:** My girlfriend has been smoking weed for years. I wasn't a fan of it at first, so she quit for me during the first half year of our relationship. However after these things started happening, she told me she wanted to do it just to help her. I agreed, I would've done anything to see her not scream and cry. It helped at first. I bought her a vaporizer for her birthday and I talked to her viciously anti-pot parents to try to get them to see our side. I started doing it with her for a while because she wanted to do it with me and when she did, she loved it. Times were so bad for her I did anything I could to make her happy. After several sessions with her, however, I noticed that she would go into episodes while high, and I would be in no state to deal with it. I quit since then.

**Pot smoking negatives:** Over time, the Prozac worked and she got better, but she continued to smoke constantly with her friends. I started noticing a negative effect to the pot smoking, something which her therapist has backed me up on. Many times she would smoke while with me and it would cause an argument and for her to slip into an episode. This culminated when one time she got in a fight with her parents and went to her friends house to smoke, I picked her up after work and within the 10 minutes it took to drive to my house she started freaking out at me over me saying I didn't like the sounds my engine was making. She was angry that I wouldn't set aside my issues on her bad night. This got very heated and I started driving her home but she started hitting me as I was driving. I had to pull into a plaza and call her parents to pick her up (I work late so this was at about midnight). In the meantime she continued to yell at me and hit me. I vowed to take some time because I was affected so strongly by it. The next day her mom and sister plead me to come see her because she was laying in bed and refused to eat and take her medication. I went, hoping to try and help. Again she expected me to do things and got upset when I wouldn't. I ended up leaving. The next day she finally got better and cried to me apologizing, we made an appointment with her therapist and worked it out. Since then things have been more or less the same as the past months, nothing worse.

**The current situation:** Last Wednesday me and her had an extremely rare night where nothing negative happened. I picked her up, we got a pizza, went to my house, watched a movie, fell asleep, the next day we went to her house and hung out some more before I had to leave for work. She has been getting better for a time but this was *amazing*, I had one of the best nights I've had in a while with her, it was perfect. Which is why what happened is so unexpected.

This past Friday I was at work and she called me. We chatted for a bit and it was great. She could tell that something was on my mind, so she asked me what was up. I told her ""I want to talk to you about something"". This something was an uncomfortable topic so I was hesitant, but it was nothing bad, my tone was just as happy as it was a second ago when we were chatting. Out of the blue she starts yelling at me to just say it and to stop being quiet. Which of course caused me to not want to and become defensive. She got very angry and hung up. I was used to this, these types of things happened often. I was hurt but I gave her time, because that's usually what she needs.

The next day (Saturday) she texts me that she's very upset with me for what happened the night before and she's overall feeling very bad in terms of depression and anxiety. She told me she doesn't want to talk and that she texts me when she's feeling better. I reply ""Ok, get better"". She texted me back saying how she doesn't appreciate me being ""dry"", which I wasn't intending to be. So I text her back clearing it up, telling her that I understand that she wants time and wishing her to get better. She doesn't reply. This was already extremely unusual for her.

She knows that these complete breaks from eachother affect me negatively. I didn't do anything to deserve this and it hurt, but I understood if it meant for her to get better. She doesn't text me at all. I assume she's at home recuperating.

Yesterday (Sunday) my worry got the better of me. I texted her asking how she is. She tells me she's ""not well, bad mindset currently, too many thoughts, I've never felt so lost"". She proceeds to tell me that she got super drunk last night. Which worried me instantly. First, she has a bad reaction to alcohol now that she's taking prozac and hasn't drank anything more than a glass of wine in months. Second, she has GERD (acid reflux disorder) and alcohol exasperates it immensely. And third: she has very bad habits when drinking excessively, not since she's been with me but in the past, involving sex and drugs. She then told me ""I just want to be drugged right now, get smashed and high"".

I tried talking her out of it. I told her to just hang out at home with her sister and her dog (which her parents just got her two weeks ago to help her). I tried reminding her of whats important. For our one year anniversary I made her a jar with 300 handwritten notes inside it; 100 memories, 100 things I love about her, and 100 lyrics and quotes that mean a lot to us. I made her this so she could read the notes whenever she's feeling bad. I told her to use that jar. I told her that drugs are not the answer and to not turn to them, I enquired into who she drank with and what she did last night.

Her reply to all of this was ""That's not happening"" and then flat out refused to tell me anything about her night. She continued telling me about how much weed helps her and how much she wants to get drunk. I told her again that I don't think weed has a positive benefit on her anymore and again reiterated that she should stay home and recover. Her reply was ""K I'm not talking to you anymore"". She then called me and told me how she went out to a shisha bar with a bunch of people and got wasted the night before. Then she lashed out at me again for what happened Friday night over the phone, for being dry over text Saturday morning (which I wasn't), and for not texting her sooner (which she asked me not to do because she needed time). She said ""aren't you tired of always having something to fix? Why can't we just have a chill relationship?"" Essentially blaming all of this on me. This was too much for me. I hung up and texted her my feelings about all of this.

Initially I got angry, I wrote her a text telling her how I did nothing to deserve this and this isn't ok. I wrote ""Text me when you're done being a bitch and see the situation for what it is. You know I'll be there to forgive and forget. But I'm not putting up with this bullshit for a second longer."" This is *VERY* unusual for me, I pride myself on being able to keep my cool with her during situations like this but I hit my limit. She lashed back at me. I didn't want to keep the cycle going so I took a little break of an hour and collected myself and texted her back.

I told her how I don't know what happened or is happening to her but I don't appreciate the way she's been treating me. I told her how all this has affected me and how I felt I did nothing at all to deserve it. I told her that the thing I wanted to talk to her about on Friday was uncomfortable for me and her attacking me for not spitting it out was unnecessary and hurtful. I told her that I didn't intend to be dry on Saturday and was just trying to be understanding of her wishes to take some time to herself and wishing her to get better sincerely. I told her that I've been nice and kind during this entire ordeal (up until my angry text). I told her about how much she's hurting me and how my trust for her has been compromised after I thought she was home recovering but instead went out partying. I told her that this is not acceptable to me and that I do not wish to be in a relationship where my partner thinks this is ok to do.

She texted me back saying ""I can't believe you said that stuff (referring to these calm texts), I am speechless, thank you for breaking up with me over text"". I told her that I wasn't breaking up with her, I just told her how I was feeling and how the situation affected me and how if she thinks that these things are ok to do, then I can't be in this relationship anymore. I told her to take her time to sort herself out and respond to me when she can. She has not replied since.

I am so burnt out by all this. I don't know whether I was right or wrong in anything I did or said. I don't know how this will end. I don't know what to do.
   
**TL;DR**: Girlfriend has been suffering from anxiety and depression for years. Borderline personality disorder in past 6 months. I have tried to be as understanding and compassionate as I can. Something changed for the worse this weekend. On Friday she freaked out at me for no reason, Saturday told me she was in a bad state and didn't want to talk yet that night went out and got drunk with her friends. Sunday she told me that all she wants to do is get drunk and high, when I tried calming her down and making her see clearly she lashed out at me for it and then again for the events of the past few days. I got angry and texted using harsh language, which she replied in kind. Then I collected myself and told her how all this has affected me and how I cannot stand for it.

**Request:** I am willing to answer any and all questions you may have about me, her, or our relationship. All I ask is that you please don't assume anything. All I focused on was her mental illnesses, which inevitably paint a very negative image. It's impossible to describe a person or a relationship entirely. If you're curious about anything, ask and I will answer.

Plus some of you are correct that me doing this in secret has already put me in a hole. On top of that the only times I ever see her the most is when she is at her work. And I'm hardly ever there. (She works at a bakery). Honestly if I ever have a chance to ask her out I'll take it. But as for telling her the flowers were from me that will either be after I ask her out, or never if I or she finds someone else.","I [22 M] gave my crush [20 F] a bouquet of flowers for valentines day anonymously. She thinks it's from another guy, and doesn't suspect me. Should I tell her?
